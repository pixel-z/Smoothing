13229.186428230216
Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.	14183.573016516213
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	26304.485071955518
We do not know what is happening.	4.0401957029664874
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	1011.997673947381
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	24791.95449379379
That did not happen.	72.93975629240646
This seems to me to be a workable solution.	99.99353099770254
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	8151.6467937427715
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	10257.599666248196
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	11038.347373905173
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.	14074.50583708949
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.	29769.92906934621
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.	478.1944060525828
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.	3754.0837344976144
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.	615.7204198527332
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	3469.9326925896016
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.	15124.380623010326
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.	20078.564515379072
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.	17710.311627016417
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	16641.820294279605
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.	17590.78114475518
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	8507.70271237849
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	650.3003401736887
A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.	17590.36147941808
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.	62316.611588978965
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1812.0483216346452
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	1231.6804393422851
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.	15059.988050227505
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.	17239.415198751616
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.	17158.616315437965
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.	115.43307999133184
I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.	6535.33026888268
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.	849.2417461866514
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.	558.4922875161064
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.	2362.814911991015
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	2002.6876835514006
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.	173.565857936939
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);	24.342009348230906
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.	2853.804816269697
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	335.1007679088041
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.	1149.4765988538993
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.	244.2074334261138
We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.	4662.50713524289
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.	9663.493386070759
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.	10384.908918006453
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.	721.2868825101567
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.	18419.22776737075
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.	4961.5338424026995
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?	11874.179422262445
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.	6224.895267144408
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.	6122.38655520124
I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.	16676.699454269357
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.	5186.985214351392
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	30.03370710717058
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.	46091.05222975579
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.	2295.7268049325385
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.	12359.4891628956
Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.	6568.107235464541
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.	627.6263458005429
Did these firms need state aid to survive?	39037.089326739304
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.	35583.360757622766
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.	2714.8568167754142
How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara?	39180.81472545473
Here improvements should be made.	257.89082802936997
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	17548.226297771136
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.	17572.227343020233
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.	1142.210069780394
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.	2645.2709077016566
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.	29220.79767967259
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	19903.107714651745
After five years only four have done so.	1040.3217890944397
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	118.97958246480287
Yet, every year we have the same problem.	1055.5198801663144
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?	22639.10838479253
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.	11742.475059500486
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	2475.3581018848686
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.	1114.5175552899207
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.	4606.065913344142
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.	43988.48840330843
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community' s economic life.	6056.647768659155
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?	31596.17220916813
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	4492.281213645747
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	38415.68239172677
Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS))	7.303733865537947
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	18700.41162161367
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.	2938.797559221913
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes.	3180.4302981983747
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	36375.3071891075
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	11379.016937905017
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.	15243.970035296194
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.	100.84313362026637
What is now needed is action.	877.6208030920786
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	9227.878069751585
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	12754.166340180342
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	62619.293490087766
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	1499.2172557636973
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	1375.63527344247
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	59106.0162056468
Many thanks for this.	271.54088918503527
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	3033.9982409090567
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	13853.236145557312
What are we to do now?	4.662311153144588
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.	1183.191001607186
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.	39405.105671664394
There are reputable companies too.	469.37307928736834
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	58109.62861867366
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	3288.3714984474072
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	6558.590876946391
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	103538.07564486816
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.	4117.990764242962
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	626.3491144292401
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.	848.9437224463903
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	1054.7244301707203
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	777.1969607304804
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	1516.1076308535396
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	2048.9414960468825
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.	8735.22004890983
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	1060.733610958949
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	395.92783473524133
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	2463.91666519397
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	7552.4139275712105
Food safety	108.52231700620915
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	305.9381334955583
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.	7343.253989595124
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	6937.5243695952095
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	20856.76570216515
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	102.21387629524145
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.	5759.823455736198
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	16757.670623178423
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	1461.214679176803
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.	16707.563322539103
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	3104.786245785046
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	4811.5436744843955
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	1590.7781985878237
So much for the political aspect.	112.70416609360926
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	269.1039815226003
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	36190.57002076292
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	16980.31606297919
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	4084.2440744895475
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	21083.57210882966
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.507465248488423
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	579.5846521183819
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	257.5257164054473
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	32979.62444241232
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	28904.265611243707
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.	38251.88136867838
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.	1601.791797891301
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.	3202.627151727856
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	162.53810528630513
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	42233.434628074036
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	18604.488929822368
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	42812.44393224208
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.	17737.766314160093
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	4260.562054329608
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	846.9714959247583
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated.	17987.074520440285
That is just the way things are, however.	718.7139101625497
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	1494.4841434189798
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	25787.31242032934
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	4565.391532077979
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	34262.48279906252
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	3770.3189529251445
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	9732.724394079645
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	16245.109872265328
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	15814.314012810375
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	69.75382686050635
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	5574.328226847355
Allow me to start with the most important demand.	82.10546890255597
We do not want financial control to be abolished.	683.3769793350694
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	2306.2094887025683
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	3481.684302300807
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	4713.2846860256805
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	53496.675377848915
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	79582.61544721197
Parliament is a separate subject.	206.87404392625973
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	1679.4969443659375
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	11433.411764723429
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	19557.192919273362
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.	3419.4584193487776
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	13.946310813350566
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	1385.20298731644
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.	2247.547009911988
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	234.80718740105956
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	52693.8982041809
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	244032.50973174543
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	30098.668956158068
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	1505.877274204403
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.	5672.044394782242
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy.	28402.06808986063
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.	88.61590326083558
How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know.	2175.84869492724
Mr President, I would like to refer, firstly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate. My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it.	3552.492904546968
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy.	44.16518112706327
Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.	1730.6723587035733
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid.	1053.1948946363077
Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.	3951.705926395602
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria, but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue.	2760.9169024085554
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process, it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity.	1521.7717127927285
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU).	954.5929584851359
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.	6618.361983426704
In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union.	1786.0319687180074
Commissioner Vitorino, although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable, words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us.	50776.9322466614
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.	11107.648828039197
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.	4431.677278826932
And who is not in favour of security, freedom and justice?	209.87224431536978
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.	5816.130536550801
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which were referred to earlier on.	1712.3222541004336
We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told.	11217.443394106582
Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.	39413.54285082066
Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.	4367.643280297642
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.	11507.507431148193
Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich, so much so that it became difficult to gather, i.e. to put those decisions into practice.	7144.511924345297
In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.	18251.566240111548
However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.	2037.8236590958559
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission' s relationship with the Council.	2656.3324813203785
The matter is still open.	666.0003857152573
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda.	252.11380536652493
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.	1227.7649386980372
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?	64184.73472511843
Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious.	77288.60770549582
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.	6477.882745286557
In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	1350.9633201267895
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety.	337.5497667946749
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.	38017.209478382596
If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.	9958.448845647563
I would ask him to be brief.	5.460964618546781
That concludes questions to the Council.	65.0600370509311
Fourthly, technically speaking, this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control.	6112.154450616917
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	13059.582100815029
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	13328.797782235695
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	15456.541311412138
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	4005.7177534610905
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.	1604.8172938277403
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions.	4100.633573095901
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	5378.515660139443
Madam President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and, above all of course, Mr Désir, for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.	1354.1693230085264
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	31539.562281898958
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	6798.954714007217
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ?	2526.547598434308
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	74748.27279884215
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	8120.033315018553
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.	330.19846288399407
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	40241.11573958755
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	9888.312985103894
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected?	14923.687648850992
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	18690.87371221936
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	134768.75597784744
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	51264.57394796087
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party' s summit meeting.	28346.368981627253
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	15511.619463847537
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	705.3337757267466
Madam President, this is an historic moment, as it is now, at last, quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values.	716.1785080384792
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	5140.756230375643
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	159.98990577160984
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary.	151194.69509450957
Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat.	19151.86749536102
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.	13053.463151823604
We must therefore find a political solution.	92.79032463692383
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States.	16200.951854077997
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	560.9676897767288
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.892737028463341
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	21847.108822922557
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	227.43586804686612
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	1138.2634393481342
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists.	12704.082144477235
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	148.48805833271476
How would you describe this?	2966.3830910807146
If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	10772.951440095034
The Commission?	53.462651779830495
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	2154.0972477382898
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	1554.7753501974419
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	1929.7557471556715
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	16321.88872440442
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	3001.9117604006883
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.	290.1005622510149
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	12809.654538452842
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	1283.5700590075821
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	364.1271983750482
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	7097.072281785961
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	6163.226149569448
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	2649.7931776913447
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	20481.57537738431
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	13262.576847123879
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	3170.3951156368225
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	6391.531665863914
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	4243.741687833232
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	5970.571955567164
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process.	6661.937361146408
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.	2295.702609737113
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	30231.59640724076
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement.	3130.620404645672
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	8261.59658160822
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.	635.3482415606834
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	33597.827976143744
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card.	279.8156813805573
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	4165.552747955195
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account.	206.27377430198956
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.	12942.230849950098
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States.	447.4822484885405
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law.	1126.1089239150288
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council.	175.38311042249933
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity.	17908.00063572696
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom.	1161.4059083884233
Why do I think we need the directive so much?	766.4720143061619
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?	30356.361386661476
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	98.34428786887116
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	1646.7491295563218
Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system.	8259.85743310301
These are two of Vice-President Marinho' s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	311.5437611018456
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.	13860.150738163664
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.	3430.0952196903054
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.	270.6172096769973
Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades.	8177.127336340283
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	9488.573428870832
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.	7523.820418707433
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	2658.3136610645006
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	12338.25164624199
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	3365.831528727327
We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	9991.667874919414
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors.	32097.737902391455
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?	18303.573519275393
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme.	325.8669944313048
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy.	5236.502762340542
Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive.	30999.908227542623
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	966.3184622463907
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.	923.7735484227554
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings.	9525.534902277055
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	3077.5270379457456
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture.	4021.081570661342
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.	3783.8886199918047
We therefore have a number of amendments.	36.3742218116352
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer.	763.8411649156793
This means that we need a pressure instrument.	90.29638433052973
According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value.	2271.0523194013754
After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position.	1117.654281416213
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer?	11884.96587057215
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area.	1396.200399656072
Mr President, this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life.	16072.976427148928
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.	4188.047434449277
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year.	686.1251300053059
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved.	16595.859449377498
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	27862.800985162914
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible.	270.0061578332092
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	13669.020013557869
Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	73865.79467784346
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.	1968.110131361489
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.	6107.281758849421
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation.	3639.0266238642475
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	6540.123658913104
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles.	529.643346743219
These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government.	15064.468306145622
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable.	399.673889703884
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.	21928.611356136575
We already have an infrastructure.	203.43755614228363
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council.	719.9772697353947
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	12374.122338003332
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis.	5486.846961327893
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	2.0213833193526605
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4.	1369.8817028224028
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.	281.40286858214625
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles (8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	15.312653508226376
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.	48037.452228905575
It is therefore important that the manufacturer' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised.	940.8637149130142
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms.	34866.7450567283
On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.	1936.4098691588977
Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.	17062.78240498736
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.	6945.806330774477
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	5053.25046869903
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place.	26.346042077314276
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.	24578.955473957194
For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one.	7062.723427205813
All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator.	13520.21548807176
Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6.	2111.739296817353
In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.	4776.025345367354
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	7325.691591742378
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.	56449.01042542144
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.	524.0403456177761
I passionately defend Europe' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law.	442.5558093753917
However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy.	6371.269971726416
We attach crucial importance to applying, if necessary, the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its actions, infringes fundamental citizens' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU' s Council of Ministers removed.	11969.238888484602
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	6670.30328336501
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.	1295.1539899111879
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stands for.	2602.2514713496525
Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition.	30754.658933020757
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ.	2849.5382048173688
However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem.	1447.1862817171195
That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings.	113392.38403177106
In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic.	3661.761220584463
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.	15170.428727298327
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	15140.669336302903
Including Jörg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.	28848.473021147045
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.	223.2095411498085
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed.	128.65292922834533
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France.	34858.40469710641
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.	751.9287338515302
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	1086.4686738398148
We are taking legal advice.	243.62750463425374
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their conformity with the general guidelines, adopted.	22594.795010656453
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	24530.563562624764
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	7660.781487121499
It should prevent society from splintering.	1309.3730660749127
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that.	105568.86700236282
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	356.9894338503365
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission' s support programmes.	20050.74815741024
Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy.	29668.132979999613
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	8869.744541010265
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	2704.3421648321428
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start.	26146.190697254882
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe: firstly, the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road, water treatment facilities and related transport networks; secondly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment, which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe.	10243.636499849155
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	549.3825344207664
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	1484.1505170307016
Five months are provided for this.	1173.362773589678
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	12674.172673440995
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	12374.561453949042
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	911.7086188658006
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	15324.863250428494
And since this is St. Valentine' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love.	27963.851983307493
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	38347.01052178759
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	2204.3318079413075
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	39777.98801599794
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	10023.853632506522
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	513.263175915176
On the contrary.	3.4683011919011446
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	7951.2980264793105
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	23008.132126937508
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	2902.5486806748354
The problems in Europe' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	3503.686552785771
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.	4776.828846454831
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	26317.8796261466
The Union' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	14859.179547811635
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	1126.1258707335521
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.	1830.0705549155575
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	3702.1976047153935
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	455.4835397955091
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative.	73.06949523181424
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	4382.654810877327
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	5996.341864326616
The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives.	31217.02148743022
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs.	8435.296046028847
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	6133.449581288625
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?	9605.81546571121
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	45.28116172644516
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	14856.84595400271
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe.	1137.6867563080389
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate.	121.27788810527623
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	1047.7139516949285
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.	5878.422229225458
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	16202.06720137696
President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation, a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world: we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium, dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance, and we are living through a genuine change of epoch.	75451.62509239875
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.	497.9501572985885
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.	5264.123921773264
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	4049.0275454146035
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states.	1331.4970731220674
However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business.	2728.8675705860223
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference.	944.1092414323842
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring.	5502.733909918298
But all is not lost.	634.1642872314522
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country.	6648.763263324667
This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.	8862.68945771869
Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels.	7211.5036119052875
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity.	434.1408669171349
Have you already included your second term of office?	15748.643489996783
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	581.5264589700924
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat.	3050.2503497584225
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet.	51734.34109767056
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.	27953.521272167865
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	6349.697647196419
Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	4547.274816993604
The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union.	64119.76222630969
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas.	31622.171266251855
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment.	23385.515024284545
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people.	6436.2078368832035
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.	12590.495373416761
There must also be savings.	77.22478433420082
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.	31006.791341562515
Just a few main points.	79.26787614359722
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.	48316.34000982466
There is nothing new in your work programme.	129.77809738225065
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed.	12461.20592208083
The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.	48452.88996290729
Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion.	59771.61596978939
Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises.	21406.512542405893
If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	18607.26037144362
If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility?	36137.53786149166
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway.	850.0178942464846
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.	33516.64722911986
However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.	1827.034121659589
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	434.7959129106268
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	80512.72694515623
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State, whichever one it may be.	3035.966864798419
We can therefore welcome its adoption.	403.94484725088176
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	5273.617025919633
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union' s desire to communitise urban policy.	4868.449001806119
Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities.	2627.811799228569
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally.	14978.951961255392
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.	391.77385645225917
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.	36690.03999286663
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	14883.319560950811
The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy.	93150.23126759804
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	13970.24827372467
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.	3294.7513624412786
In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives.	4099.286070365039
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	71.49656792038809
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on.	426.46375432803376
Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy?	2220.053051525633
Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs.	3596.4482717300957
However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics.	73.69612704199469
However, before labelling we need clear rules.	1080.8531581712073
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.	1657.3444090587632
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection.	3467.8552460487313
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law.	8266.389838558043
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.	28292.438508451163
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.	192.63441870559606
First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative.	788.2125629213324
But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out.	22444.92493946262
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.7226871258448404
I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs.	8221.906476103137
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	75.8674060227469
Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.	23452.311148974775
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	1828.819087091542
One example is water transfers.	78.386957250087
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.	3482.612976428594
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.	33337.14922633255
We are not, fortunately, at this point.	118.35159130822447
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.	12112.72533915415
In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	1500.7010583129832
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	5309.4209677526
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.	5370.198932472764
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	457.07270950665014
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform.	12343.418060893435
We want to encourage debate among the people.	208.54279702205616
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark.	87485.97515321974
Will you confirm what is the case?	429.3786459443555
I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe.	8563.06099675411
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.	939.5506603705066
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	1445.496199439257
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	1431.833368422095
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.	1036.3379033745412
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	12685.612333087625
My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?	40889.871927395594
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union.	6629.200250453774
In Austria' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least.	3193.695265496092
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?	7383.898530171381
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government.	50393.70590386616
The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal.	4622.674895697372
Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises.	44534.949143864906
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	11389.682055501542
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives.	229.05914551067303
As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means.	3680.5642308588153
As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives.	19789.970909742315
We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy.	8670.468493019487
Will it discuss the matter?	308.5118360085222
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period?	12560.023712264545
On Mrs Isler Béguin' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community' s priorities during the previous programming period.	8780.005865141957
Is that really authorised?	2304.8417217015244
Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia.	6805.998797410304
I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today.	2107.325348915992
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it.	11065.807546375927
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again.	9862.679916900972
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government?	1710.9429999152883
Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible.	7556.263184191038
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00):	895.3910997062202
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union.	708.3345039780519
Such a rule is only normal.	362.2386545778411
All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work.	1897.4981249966847
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice.	646.920073180292
In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia.	7195.60463874966
For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters.	9697.016157688497
Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure.	799.0120514136349
Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky.	5115.092344944245
We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates.	33090.15345479548
Deviating from the Council' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	384.0690775081995
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants.	5610.790481313192
However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.	1389.186000035289
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less.	55415.73624162711
Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe?	2260.79216558073
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive.	2104.104636124143
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position.	4039.1031793989705
This is also expressed in Recital 14.	483.4623891535487
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables.	7174.773072622671
The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed.	3728.156081500022
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved.	45674.491696552825
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way.	6579.698587120927
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs.	3119.5645701010035
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured.	16664.83835573791
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular.	577.6309613898
And, for want of appropriations, we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop.	24608.166228316546
I feel, at any rate, that for the ultimate application of LIFE, at least, there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment.	4575.861810431929
The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough.	397.4523780961966
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	86.41619250085036
For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion.	5577.9067518730135
The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres, at a cost of FF 6 million, the cure being worse than the disease, and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site.	98931.8248331543
Four, to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee, at least one Member per political group.	9180.215123789641
Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds.	3816.463267155312
Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain.	6581.031645383293
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established.	22686.71329221454
As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	103.12623991372182
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument.	407.79733511033197
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].	11.603263941838176
The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy.	9708.410666391279
The Commission' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced.	3751.9315788992676
On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	106.85555997354466
In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play.	778.8999726322855
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind.	476.572332338665
Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level.	312.3556299309394
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc.	6090.714720407796
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	2387.0016749253236
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.	365.22615456685475
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world.	7003.7501445034095
It is an imperative.	83.39406688783848
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa.	10698.076415952744
First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: "The future of social protection" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk.	34071.69650967264
Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed.	25962.117188627413
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry.	3272.186368026161
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach.	13704.873505862071
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large.	23494.658556201037
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system.	537.9746271960862
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States.	1400.3286283642237
In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999.	5335.9440248359915
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation.	610.6414018693121
In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission' s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property.	5866.286666397531
We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.	43751.33647028385
Mr President, I just want to say that, as I was walking in this morning, I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle.	1360.9936477692274
Can you please do something about it?	195.02215356492235
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership.	28895.93606557029
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	4739.918250154424
As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports.	3505.7182064561325
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.	11985.783997183733
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.	12016.480388708771
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	53711.67246902773
But what have we seen since then?	2868.979400775444
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations.	1618.016501596978
I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa.	2834.2576419850984
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade.	4401.156101248451
In today' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious.	1937.542989167329
There are no boundaries for Community policies.	301.6405801870761
I would therefore urge the Council' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide.	4750.239470016581
I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results.	3564.858696080906
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications.	15849.325098038758
That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken.	22985.211719730312
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all.	19656.11053249225
Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all.	10092.730964691056
The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies.	3772.866884127954
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.	24576.291233247794
Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse.	7294.259388351773
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement.	23753.378537675864
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999.	70.96576136189341
It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, Iraq, in the Israeli settlements, in Burma/Myanmar, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan, and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor.	8818.015312672289
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	14017.442394627127
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not.	2843.843929574555
On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments.	23654.771637654758
. (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union.	972.2922358011211
Moreover, the concept of 'author' is not defined in the Treaties.	287.74580409457263
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty, both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health.	14015.273343726121
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty.	1623.043947419873
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if ... safe for human health and the environment" .	30196.197446302947
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	55350.14359324439
I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be.	16736.45015157727
(FR) Drinking, eating, washing, farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it, wrongly, as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource.	63338.2008221196
But the source is threatening to run dry.	5669.577550608882
The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater.	1250.0985969603066
However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.	370.71698115895396
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years.	834.4571575149008
These are the main reasons for my vote.	6.719960922294359
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility.	8002.123326243601
.	2.4763947778520725
. On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.	14454.875479057258
(FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed.	291.3198272009071
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation" .	30.346458008291982
It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.	5665.795860078137
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security.	1586.4548493549241
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative.	221.81807654329157
They see us killing each other.	72.38616259931574
This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility.	2930.335855016295
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	845.2021833732254
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction.	123.6937770154814
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.	1673.4862903799863
I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss.	11510.859189773451
It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.	33611.16975533232
It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest.	32013.002903833785
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.	324.137170807414
A multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year, may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years.	7552.103629551849
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example.	12606.432607191995
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes.	31266.719958064466
To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report.	3438.9894000857635
However, I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested.	1189.1157077567455
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7. It is quite simple: a special heading, namely, the famous heading 7, was created in Berlin, as part of the large Agenda 2000 package, for the applicant countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which are currently undergoing a process of transformation, and for these countries alone.	42795.76342133884
There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject.	359.48872756881985
That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously.	16102.610595763512
The Commission' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.	2850.8737948358025
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed?	36178.46403874086
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context.	281.41074499955
If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development.	4319.458732315034
Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague.	307.26351542821646
That, however, is not my question.	67.59377205453745
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	25227.668744781084
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights?	3480.374413040415
Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.	364.43932575262204
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity.	2305.00574071431
Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company.	21839.731404248865
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.	3580.140086913581
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.	277.85170018852403
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	5991.039166978943
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing.	148.0749842399002
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic	425.6230275161233
But you never lost hope and history proved you right.	2726.9235600509137
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	1354.2242615626787
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)	469.8396695808216
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	1531.1370684237252
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission.	758.5965255121902
Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well.	10412.219871420148
We must put a stop to this trend.	87.67969019411203
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	803.4024401004754
We back the rapporteur' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	8793.576359777806
Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union' s development policy.	1185.1004348175484
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	11999.051811152203
Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter.	179.07341701702438
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	1955.2269605090478
FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right.	4833.655066197185
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	29037.873093932507
Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	50281.560609886285
Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.	12291.942688001634
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.	1919.0635331017959
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	56663.81816522895
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	1502.6196259749759
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	6144.681164678829
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	2444.6955015413128
We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	8823.514075428102
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met?	92023.20679006269
There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia.	14377.685196160213
From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.	132998.0915199204
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole.	432.0966425389784
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	6211.472243299784
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	335.93106064698435
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March.	2381.2302526286912
The debate is closed.	1.747284916993835
Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision.	2551.8233567559128
A key problem is the time factor.	1872.001128960842
So that is at least a step forward.	38.62052874037715
That is not correct.	5.181977675576993
Overall we have a system which has made some progress.	1956.8486715061285
Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence.	14055.068439877807
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.	638.6480021869729
It is good that the procedure exists.	132.22304173478713
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.	2555.118299784912
But we see no reason to lower our guard.	7670.127572691482
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	2.549353924146452
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	2504.8830015549
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective.	12173.607308265706
We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.	2819.6075100359462
Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	39206.853693838326
Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters.	1964.5602039746589
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect.	16057.150046972347
In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis.	704.3688903432874
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session.	19524.221520857074
Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	240.93870061402518
I certainly appreciate that.	119.31948548556392
That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.	16319.884544978988
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	9747.036057940659
In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years.	8352.021724758344
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	13733.643957496477
Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives.	24130.834002357253
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.	925.0097200728447
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter.	1839.1169456442883
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	4560.167974930555
There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS.	372.05143671356575
However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated.	16723.96564596485
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	14515.950530432694
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are.	12794.53998330754
By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years.	19441.812411912786
The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas.	3972.7787691057774
Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.	11628.612212765474
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State.	13611.082822368498
It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.	5369.502886755072
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.	19739.14610464664
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	62.05043242542206
As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State.	34609.80595858313
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation.	34685.576004298
We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are.	14228.986537044235
It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime.	15958.185630378526
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him.	1514.293611777276
It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime.	20590.507482091893
Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code.	31390.610500787272
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote.	3487.1664836016544
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	7131.801517404688
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance.	12826.942620453841
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.	5958.6190885499755
The words 'issued by' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities' .	5356.586328512992
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	3278.956146077734
Before the vote	3.728561188979409
Relating to Amendment No 31	247.55939293474162
Report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999	7.775118090833011
I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport.	13847.102686569311
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	1060.4215527097388
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012).	33087.43574852451
This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending.	2438.571152677681
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis' .	2625.65645999509
Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme.	46562.32967942473
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent.	5144.970565744473
Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone.	30279.612556445525
Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	91664.64816484512
Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF.	23728.73207732309
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	1353.6503943257578
. The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998, there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection.	13006.03747845363
At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP, this dimension must not only be preserved; above all, it must be encouraged.	7940.56489945042
Although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to ACP-EU relations, the European Union also plans to police immigration, as article 13 hints, in order to justify the policy of the European states against illegal immigrants.	42177.65856731735
. Mr President, I am full of praise at the sterling efforts of MEPs --some of my Labour colleagues among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their efforts towards securing a new Lomé Agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world.	6467.428573114221
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle.	33964.07694146409
And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.	23235.23417103307
It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past.	6323.809865727002
Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it.	5335.110275611228
The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive.	792.968147294275
Action is not limited to legislation.	1162.2050511916802
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	34312.18193052128
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.	2747.2277649355856
A company is pilloried one day and not the next.	6484.3680654786185
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	61842.250653250725
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.	17741.005524964854
Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow.	28217.946372499297
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' .	3500.9588167794927
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone.	17333.401713047355
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.	16279.02057409659
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	12804.327950075804
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	663.9110212118717
B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	111.31125559572196
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.	13279.137072187146
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s.	18266.707474096893
All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería.	71611.59616486558
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.	10198.736867978254
For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded.	8963.683152255793
Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050?	61814.030654485
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully.	34182.561578100045
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.	5828.338307143389
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	26775.08387974171
They ask us where their children are, their sons.	20813.149585819418
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	16789.080723252853
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly.	17591.994643573256
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.	10500.551736727693
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.	12189.657033912363
In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights.	1156.7941352224398
The war in Chechnya, like any war, is a trail of horrors.	5029.719251624032
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	37771.260068228214
Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations.	2555.4927733650065
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations.	8432.459336263235
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	24104.69550738062
First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails.	30563.96478375618
We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola.	1625.5963558909784
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola.	21987.639033102445
At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties.	190.98697623584846
B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party,	2227.5493997087497
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	1465.106297567493
First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.	25529.61966466085
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent.	7429.74776267197
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.	878.5634399974779
Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments.	10419.303224209245
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them.	26250.702938532366
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs.	3472.1334150448415
It is an obvious truth, and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators, that thanks to tourism, many Mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants, and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers emigrating.	47772.9227525511
There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery.	13158.56943926661
This is not desirable, either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment.	873.4124531509518
It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied.	3158.3139061958746
It is a very extensive report.	135.2525440828206
As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for.	4716.1957902366585
The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them.	111524.59653645598
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level.	245.66815493819522
Since then, however, there has been no progress.	178.14939422256245
Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure, so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism.	48303.16082823198
As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector.	11733.605234006065
It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage.	26523.934844468735
My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward.	1512.740776616347
This very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. We now hope to be able to solve these problems.	6732.775853916555
However, in this case, the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens.	221.42366052620397
This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations, not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea, for example, but also during winter when we go to take the air.	101974.33286145984
These possibilities should be fully exploited.	2277.0188049123035
Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology.	10565.52786595665
The European Community' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector' s potential for growth and employment.	7352.514199798307
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	2.0547863732554785
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective.	3133.388673279208
European postal services	1042.4836031487248
Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition.	3775.011755425439
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen.	12243.495830663873
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.	7755.218502716901
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.	19.486774822393638
Let us point out that Parliament' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them.	999.6299409502476
But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.	6625.186062126827
In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.	8583.734941945637
Do we have the results of this impact study?	1605.8158898651907
As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.	8246.781414687353
So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.	72194.51635858759
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators.	4014.9631181718237
This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union.	795.0845406391768
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.	2701.749672024674
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.	68597.88773592885
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops.	39205.01440694098
At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.	15048.247971340943
That is the measure of the problem.	55.54322314960262
Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring.	25456.188165187534
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	2.0213833193526605
We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone.	25423.468804411896
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.	9356.51878969304
The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session.	482.7508006303528
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.	35686.05710942895
Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents' era and their parents' era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live.	123244.69910386001
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.	4614.353536430972
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.	43426.577335047565
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination.	17675.548649980134
This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.	7693.868857171078
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities.	472.60222467360416
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	5043.00954060752
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.	26127.5752695209
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.	59565.31772361506
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.	41393.58297092683
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	18982.711437573944
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	44618.255284298524
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.	144148.08932451557
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.	447.9037683800386
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.	4618.566471878602
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	17943.430551364898
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.	4081.838707494347
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.	30744.07411883815
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	816.2892682022665
We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.	65315.307738515934
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	5971.992772122424
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs.	4964.4202930055335
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.	1096.0810222289517
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.	4188.274261913001
However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament.	155.9038106370913
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.	11314.958622897717
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!	24221.322250088688
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.	5622.993877564872
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	15104.889065354702
This too is unacceptable in my view.	19.995843115530015
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.	3229.141649325798
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	5203.366962338716
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.	1648.3938025219893
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?	62109.352928934124
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.	5256.845899874749
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?	32658.888126299935
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	6165.081707609093
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.	3023.000173928211
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	3798.5530104571844
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer' and the reply was 'a black grandmother' .	103487.43721138577
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	40837.94726169644
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	327.44731057226835
But the figures tell the true story.	1489.6679693830988
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.	16506.909204964028
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.	1932.9352766944112
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	20588.79155114407
The first is the issue of the media' s influence.	298.604845374347
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	8291.331404046423
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.	38267.162467245646
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.	37751.227360771605
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."	18971.264989565003
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.	9149.634251172454
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.	3637.195829981061
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.	4768.713852597749
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history.	11313.509446380302
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems, with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war.	14202.94228551023
I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster.	2214.90904937495
I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing.	382.24605637947144
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.	28809.82932313348
As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid. Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods.	17628.075403778977
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report?	912.5598363235667
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.	120.66354652218791
An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.	57103.11186242189
Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report.	102.68049765556113
My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker.	2771.66380924114
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so.	7503.324926686254
It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view.	7395.396256130241
I think that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide, socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly.	7042.555003460758
However, I believe that there are also some elements of consensus.	136.16850275085037
Common fisheries policy	2007.5223089187434
Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion.	49923.384694049775
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen.	1566.898692885429
I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong.	103044.11096344347
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements.	71761.29057093608
Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA.	19101.885273311902
Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance.	544.628919455856
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms.	14463.289617543413
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish.	21535.95997652633
In February, Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued.	32384.826107612134
Mr President, Mr Fischler, my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues, as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen.	29829.676558811727
I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy' s effectiveness which must therefore, in my opinion, be significantly improved.	1600.8500917501938
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.9650535919237584
The debate is closed.	1.747284916993835
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past.	5028.189028233499
This is an unwise policy.	165.3071744515997
Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry.	1643.9488915670497
Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these.	32716.773999278037
It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment.	10211.560087533306
In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management.	18399.048703353903
Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed.	40039.92503954439
Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland.	35187.61713372343
The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany.	3520.7981604220977
It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union, in the majority of States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects.	7745.196830004145
Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses.	5140.939996787198
Shipwreck of the Erika	14388.129288681057
Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions.	4026.489897300434
Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis.	29002.76026053265
The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause.	40996.70662149223
