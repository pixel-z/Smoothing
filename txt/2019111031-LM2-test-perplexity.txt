(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	2.1420586374424415
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	220.78397599206386
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	129.73379491915608
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	1007.8651493108371
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	28.445900684541787
Relating to Wednesday:	4.235773573656777
(Parliament rejected the request) President.	5.543119246263132
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.	33.00342904419818
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	227.68473275376033
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	147.40300412132382
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	523.5990849354089
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.	976.8509722891812
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	638.6865137271872
This is a pity, in a sense.	14.42943249772203
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	77.41566701648993
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.	75.47756976305311
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	101.36933317327083
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.	69.3488822754652
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.	14.389457417202088
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.	124.66058557334497
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.	377.8063815113335
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.	855.8455526423538
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.	101.5479168719615
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	476.5426317705878
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.	337.679866453383
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.	115.72703921686696
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.	325.97969541770044
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.	40.12443594346304
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	113.53053963655054
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.	98.52198658658212
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.	286.67695174163066
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".	306.8161275020685
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.	40.83934397238473
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.	415.4890813123284
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.	143.3394633268392
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union	10.951798032673022
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.	177.9390629260044
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	33.82201647728416
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.	50.297801211348705
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	6.718789051083234
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.	15.638708587059323
We must give them this opportunity.	16.64270303613788
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.	97.8024856057319
Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.	86.42061821346944
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	3.3935541350881135
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	418.0968561271269
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.	157.3425671094649
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.	156.6937031824897
However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it.	271.85659951994916
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.	52.897774280306656
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.	173.54216122347566
By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.	471.29330453032475
In order to function, the market needs rules.	47.20148086254435
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	267.52882728543943
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.	287.3398937152478
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.	145.3855336692871
When will we debate that?	32.91463511670886
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.	95.66690634597146
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	60.17345205083034
Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.	601.3455431101517
They are still in training, as it were.	51.12157424830528
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.	385.8048309261968
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.	14.327837147215513
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.	105.78625353984016
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.	1319.0707913893468
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.	45.31084452845724
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.	73.83220485541592
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.	306.4335080429715
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	147.45932504067463
But opinion differs as to the solution.	74.83107745107826
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.	127.72904339019681
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	224.57348609408245
Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group.	154.86025828081625
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.	505.72981149953085
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	457.7773488171479
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.	76.97543677620095
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	3.248360029557306
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	54.34112905577327
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	741.8257687088355
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.	87.38121119979824
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.	201.52113152830972
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	67.20916278899989
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.	343.5962045579464
I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.	179.38747205204498
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.	66.90535763585817
In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.	257.20211746892096
Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.	81.25040843109342
Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.	915.0814099433579
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.	120.76740005805084
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.	865.1638715025833
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	188.2423747349901
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting.	212.4810995127694
Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament.	66.20078832140172
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.	553.65540196342
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.	481.2494139478457
Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!	142.27971230931212
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)	118.23686392663932
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.	310.04152303256876
.	2.5013122860961254
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.	1223.2534828873952
The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.	61.253182938825574
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	810.5167773749671
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.	440.0441980042326
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	857.3676466816004
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.	1018.7183575719283
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).	301.033709383069
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?	478.15514521734974
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.	58.32260680885525
Many thanks for this.	35.645165594506416
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	632.9505908663999
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	260.0458639370141
It is a miracle that they were saved.	48.07056947501193
Things could well continue in the same way.	32.72299717824101
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	86.95236477565034
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	172.73568871340683
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	30.44281351291528
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	150.5863272536645
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	13.86537429642445
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	238.463088471387
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	160.4260965335692
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	232.5490194098883
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	3710.9266823262874
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	139.94332397979815
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	152.44068930986865
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	907.0654596131479
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	125.86486673463993
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	1310.917842602341
For example, as they stand, the Commission' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.	364.9156629487911
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	924.0324453130569
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	96.48663277034214
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	687.6375452829133
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	882.2271491025357
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	756.1237921186134
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	330.8502290214594
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	104.75045858342034
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	161.67615043436584
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	994.651825538683
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	46.33330476267484
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	236.86609893316063
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	335.803914763776
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	742.4883566523548
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	100.1779652480711
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.	52.45143019301739
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	291.5499699475706
That concludes the debate.	2.272522931833153
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	3.7021272752465015
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	262.1226541002803
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	709.6551411617606
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	577.5782117137338
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	349.09608526616194
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	208.2740715941342
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.	224.3667108615139
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	978.5896431004425
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	247.71288357189718
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	137.34537357590557
What concrete measures have been discussed?	137.7797642718088
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.	428.6085093850797
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	156.60083500905043
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month.	97.6167590455451
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).	1278.1507179031714
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?	41.10357034546002
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	59.01510283762682
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.	388.8797581670639
1997 discharge	15.159586370243614
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	359.6767202447609
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	293.59927968729534
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	107.83264667063213
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	24.11756259588073
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	244.10177434691968
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	174.22517832256602
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	50.6576935725659
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	371.2476306909762
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	229.21756670269758
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	113.91977710920148
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	130.80089545247884
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	973.3623326230135
A new independent audit system service must be set up.	56.184089946160846
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	74.10949775186768
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	780.509334644265
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	1423.818937291021
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.	56.74857231838247
Have the lessons not been learnt?	66.61258628250074
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	1003.0327728527859
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	305.2852372496057
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	18.783921278056756
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	660.1736574577462
Mr President, the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.	386.398406647488
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.	331.86759243171497
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	648.6611535698469
This must be regulated during the IGC.	27.108747758962792
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	119.98836813349851
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	214.02633683954238
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.	170.53655940844934
It is important to remember that.	6.28809358141268
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	396.26457726731695
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	84.50850620047305
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	6.1121023414787405
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	67.98663556785047
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	373.74689904701006
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	135.9924704924774
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	41.11258694399609
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.	123.26889272320213
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.	105.66229241726857
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.	424.14934965342405
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	746.2515196053131
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.	1243.9350422955097
Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.	359.7060622418859
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo' s speech set here.	92.91260288314334
I want to emphasise four points.	25.033923724002268
There, the border question is obviously central.	60.778268684532414
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date.	288.1018652052149
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.	230.23503672220343
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis' anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect.	509.5190926413025
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.	796.194676831274
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?	23.806862676920062
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas.	63.40598399509365
In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.	560.0479154870864
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future.	745.7835501934087
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol.	131.49104388970323
In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council.	120.14685027207906
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses.	131.92229866070957
With regard to Schengen, without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council, or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework, I would like to stress, on the topical subject of restoring border controls, that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority.	279.9807264628932
Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.	375.5362157820612
We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them.	18.482237512993283
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown.	241.67855064066592
Arrested and released in Madrid, he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon.	2330.02060370625
Answers are still awaited.	1241.323425074348
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	1074.154319683517
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.	559.1001562331214
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	23.478430778979853
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.	286.29330733459
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.	210.78008589925562
I thank them for their statements to the House.	32.48204204417828
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.	160.54113619465525
I refer to Eurodac.	53.43185148176928
But I want to add a word of caution.	49.72024582463186
(Sustained applause)	255.03682313014812
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control.	63.39271236070446
It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.	3249.5792803659683
Genuine transparency of the institutions' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	162.19609259825845
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked.	85.07889226579051
After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies.	1232.8013159548489
Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.	992.7500797360331
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France' s at 10%.	510.0166063533298
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.	1000.7175005561533
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning.	344.8288433536882
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.	205.66300715161844
I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers.	102.71522957074869
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations?	518.8101351652098
Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.	40.74173651686787
This is, and will continue to be, connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation.	33.45243273179132
Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe' s main fears.	620.8871818929729
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties.	191.74449733925047
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	501.9588504904183
If the Union takes the initiative, this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world, including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.	458.88345494018023
We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation.	63.87847950561084
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	104.50302345387934
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work.	553.7430736057892
The world' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	532.8936941105504
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe.	2586.3434267813136
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	367.24648853000434
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	305.2559702672308
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	526.5178222326947
I have received four motions for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.	122.8660069129302
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	937.3788905209865
Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	325.96924329201715
If you ratify ...	7.696576624896562
However, we already knew this.	38.34839025889566
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	159.632740233248
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	248.74477086889618
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	562.8572823165903
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	491.22188376437083
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!	2423.528756771109
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	530.1410648606486
We are talking about us, not Austria.	27.30572740487914
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent.	354.85006294932134
Perhaps, in order to strengthen the Union' s democracy, it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves" into Europe.	528.6348204664587
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	36.74611480897951
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	45.79948718806798
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire.'	629.7241143046119
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	269.7575870378511
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	61.64781364998952
It is also a matter of conviction.	38.1782311355749
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action.	776.8754641272164
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	55.449438795069426
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one.	142.35500657054868
This issue is extremely topical.	8.589494086414376
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.	522.5459397632203
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	152.69861310182733
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	173.4313171083917
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	37.4096578785165
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	136.9501273632747
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful.	110.69054021214161
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.	139.37437567513032
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	338.26465860908104
Brussels knows best.	55.386822348214
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore ...	127.55997982778723
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	66.94790698281265
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	30.3382765442456
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	108.45062447109235
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	1003.023510329562
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	660.1262523691064
Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state.	130.89485127697742
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned.	154.58782565053633
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	151.36427823317098
As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	150.64289929883256
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.	357.25329392779577
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.	88.44366485766925
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	126.26241933158111
Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.	64.15303426988974
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.111566404345121
Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.	86.4226874511547
When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals.	240.7210414972815
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.	256.7468826770781
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	26.209721534867036
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.	419.03249290025644
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	179.80374144656375
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	16.784400104668435
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22.	26.3635635263482
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	124.73359283815671
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States.	98.9790182075322
The debate is closed.	1.748735324687731
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions.	47.360584194532926
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible.	103.28922797598935
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors.	108.43484111634366
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments.	365.7146606548561
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie.	233.4916288918866
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	181.41769704692263
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	128.586123581125
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	152.47153285796895
. (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.	46.0406376918661
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally.	99.13170965445059
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account.	358.4504069260234
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality, on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance.	333.0104426161035
In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.	42.11898924126237
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to.	497.61542817430245
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.	260.67119862214383
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.	108.62507075727832
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture.	225.2091495776751
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme.	97.42252274668016
I would nonetheless like, as others have done, to touch upon the procedure, which is unclear and, above all, unwanted.	242.61033481575691
It is shameful!	49.24186461150032
	636.6561317988021
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.	191.05766029046342
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial.	545.694729684683
We want a colourful Europe.	53.903056120081786
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.	2104.9546818401373
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe?	90.63158535112244
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	1206.0028235882623
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.	93.28516119053835
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car.	72.89207005628577
Mr President, Commissioner, reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks, one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe.	269.3230749601245
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.	219.0266584187459
So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of.	852.6605243659783
After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making.	219.43057003487576
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.	176.30383500027312
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.	132.99526949752283
I was myself a car worker before I was elected.	170.75666814972632
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry.	57.11820459182882
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation.	336.9148092775218
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	363.5931896149749
I can gauge its importance for my country' s international reputation.	289.57676967805804
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development.	284.8622850853588
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	48.53663390461405
If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away.	290.36306567761096
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	558.7689965383563
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas.	140.06718024074235
Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.	176.05809799642154
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	739.2914532381885
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up.	206.07213563552358
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	497.59792004976407
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste.	384.487889394331
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open.	628.1819413508115
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis?	158.72443947217283
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars.	1097.1912175247098
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer' s liability and the requirement for recycling.	92.07204765842913
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	383.698343726695
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles.	166.6798213280285
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision.	149.70248399220748
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000)	2.835772885384053
In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making.	444.7151992809298
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	8.154831716648403
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place.	5.880262164741074
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	125.15974757703185
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.	707.1018798500245
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations.	498.8368031743394
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises.	247.6982326629317
However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition.	73.58056184689887
Leopards do not change their spots.	2092.2941138370684
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.	641.6390891791737
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.	363.5012266529311
The ÖVP (Austrian People's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	843.8421806966536
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.	42.61718641564156
Madam President, on a point of order.	2.1491810996760687
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House.	112.51681904383751
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking.	215.3039953925946
I would ask you once again to work on this.	21.65748530738114
Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued.	261.42408486578324
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.	83.74400993057738
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.	27.443113204116873
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	6.817628406897614
Madam President, the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal.	317.17846996455586
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal?	5.579308676183622
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	49.410437066807425
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion.	1091.9259746784624
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	799.3105731706507
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	717.2498826794741
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	624.9032692622902
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.	73.39404090307471
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	371.19927458916743
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	809.1304929069297
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	649.5223198152381
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	68.07560839388346
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	639.8254764244043
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure.	97.26022937042386
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	205.30252775994046
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines.	152.76085038431768
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	401.64338347740375
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play, as their input in society is important in our view.	221.4330765541825
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	70.89620754600041
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	219.45774228947013
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	270.19284492164803
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	15.997247290056292
So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes.	135.17117758465295
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	809.2532844963309
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	166.21969862377912
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	464.4047764068777
We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	421.49982341994
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	743.9647636767552
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	61.30196050037668
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	644.0943404473978
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	126.20352612964322
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.	423.27157590426225
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	90.00652620573678
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourrière, for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments.	88.15364355247101
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	163.13183430886937
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	130.80903554654356
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	266.53224985179156
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	147.59214858118673
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	96.96631281484744
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	865.9389503332802
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	599.4074602802893
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	149.67019283073319
I can only fully share your concern.	63.52167601314871
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	115.50854147635918
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	691.5813750357029
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	449.49974865250215
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings	31.281964374724048
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	282.0394714330437
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	281.4712309369368
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	435.602202503324
I did not hide behind any immunity.	102.21155476961185
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	1078.6422600669346
Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.	588.4751869534374
This is what we need to do for the Balkans.	11.250165760434943
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	382.07449087574406
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	437.07365427669583
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	147.13037131313612
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.	41.50733174388429
Because it is political it is more complex.	6.322086027154682
We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.	240.99658913131032
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.	171.33095234314433
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones.	467.9169165992188
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration' , as others too have said here.	181.70848592428555
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.	424.5262943514508
Like yourself, he promised "less and better" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise.	589.4977349920624
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise.	332.98808444606277
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	736.6002920900277
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.	518.9339938494322
The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?	67.93395576388725
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds.	241.55185036657284
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?	302.932015950761
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.	1257.1356373966614
Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy.	107.26467501567268
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.	94.35165535335656
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	1403.73332042585
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe.	36.99639264829568
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility.	209.05834031904442
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.	404.9921719269212
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	657.2658074379528
In the world of new technologies, the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are.	167.00730160223168
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.	169.5791983560483
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas.	411.25591335824504
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people.	269.13370703020485
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	753.1163089273165
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ?	353.9675928223314
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.	310.33267387443703
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.	681.2909982693956
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections.	201.6198701855274
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission.	20.24091722899639
Furthermore, future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland.	371.66017309730006
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	92.10236664720331
Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us?	321.4010280307276
Without them we would not be able to function.	33.01194309026222
However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.	134.16788905916354
The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators, even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025.	1264.7916376887526
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	212.98076429290828
Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	80.29233861806884
In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted.	181.83330141281175
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	1170.2951911526663
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	643.4556777436607
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.	309.75269701064155
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community.	114.99387890385839
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	186.2203422530278
We disagree with many of the report' s views.	117.83217547750147
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials' with 'government officials' .	238.77569918398103
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	31.283639139690887
It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.	222.13445876560183
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.	83.1463583838304
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.	236.60192172605417
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal.	45.30740505565778
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.	709.2171616559741
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives.	216.49041857986032
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report.	187.36282377454413
I therefore welcome the Commission' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie.	40.86293063024239
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU.	575.9183177850093
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	19.676426119752627
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	340.6157562374204
You can see it in different countries.	23.565415340052343
In this it said that in a few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances.	343.4566381261225
It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved.	34.32963554847417
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added.	595.7866975921505
For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020.	219.974671149083
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water.	91.02987077101689
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	429.84020427636705
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading.	44.34373766392544
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	1319.9010595611485
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used.	127.37261044622358
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105.	857.1137570632862
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	141.39964463252517
In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences!	629.9332065629258
Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety.	240.18175443341394
The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance.	317.6165278203535
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management.	17.627406435150686
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources.	361.83141378491536
I understand this.	3.776851957138854
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.	174.18712521290033
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation.	534.2060581920504
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter.	119.15247081535226
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way.	732.6506669189314
I would like to finish off with this observation.	16.57247079500091
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media.	196.9524519753247
We want to encourage debate among the people.	24.96714831300569
Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process.	946.4947707741687
Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos.	105.01771997677207
Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki?	222.4657400121136
However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.	32.431320419627205
However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province.	355.7632556792807
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.	58.919956379147635
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region.	37.93199025155739
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	316.2013657675253
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality.	44.445100840371964
We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year.	442.2742074838127
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter.	36.789693353751694
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	229.50122074049804
The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one.	70.53954701853064
In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6."	49.51614161171883
The honourable Member raised the question.	31.943390693986814
The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems.	418.1813579949669
For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal.	664.6913744002284
In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.	106.58902631057305
Thank you for your reply.	2.401459393462147
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes.	137.03026418873225
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required.	679.6003809623888
The Commission' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging.	423.08873585135797
Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States?	728.2370103139558
As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives.	950.6501371858807
Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures.	120.56103550554036
As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level.	160.0386650319496
I thank the Commissioner, and do not at all question his intentions and interventions, which adopted a positive line.	112.27852563847892
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	426.2819838646008
However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs.	86.75035901074727
Quite simply there is no question of this.	17.59919158053824
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation.	75.90586639996472
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland.	68.34103093484111
Subject: Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP, the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants), what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period?	478.5919220774679
Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive.	342.10629522564096
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it.	209.05357795166069
The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively.	312.03711047072
Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier.	54.6632316895587
In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises?	409.277101262154
A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening.	382.90135838392246
We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation.	197.74365291085672
And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard.	965.6169867256712
When Sweden joined the European Union, it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States.	822.137238239729
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union.	78.29119918228618
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity.	350.1920117589719
He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn.	281.29060277267064
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget.	1172.1232044940439
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy.	5.68693144783695
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions.	183.72372365155513
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality.	40.51399840752284
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right.	99.8701617596326
Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless.	197.28815876186738
We need to look very carefully at those.	55.54912981124504
Deviating from the Council' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	59.46070815349819
In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.	537.980677700356
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants.	350.82964491363157
It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs.	725.8217194663503
It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level.	1188.103319941606
We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level.	212.6986560527347
Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges.	344.57728558401004
If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services.	522.7995287228384
With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about.	278.38741385519836
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it.	215.31700328011348
Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said.	33.86679272673222
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production.	551.1908957044607
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	305.9220457454877
The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR.	184.7235388789359
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water.	921.7511563457257
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget.	307.26579813460285
There is no other such policy.	22.1262181710048
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House.	125.11124044941033
The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment.	81.24619977700104
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument.	339.1016653061343
Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies.	237.9012818760225
With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE.	288.3159917689044
The debate is closed.	1.748735324687731
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another.	72.2423281688457
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report.	192.29517776765275
The goal of the Commission' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection.	57.5172878370944
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	257.46966578933467
As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before.	178.46319412399436
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union.	568.0764109680127
In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements.	188.0637303850538
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	109.08069097882752
It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden' s.	217.1715783612703
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things.	186.64696238724923
Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report.	3.9578043370259945
In the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the invisible economy, intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will, in many cases, be more important than traditional property.	740.6187609197285
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights.	571.8324218108183
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks.	552.8001493584181
We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet.	329.27806936837067
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets.	587.9015757268388
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration.	522.4934545247673
We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective.	266.66558414928164
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements.	97.98523714407386
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	481.36308153834824
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	808.9772177615068
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system.	241.87788557053594
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.	107.38649281396845
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production.	389.85919271696156
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me: If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all.	678.5113783825077
And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties.	120.58159630423879
In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded.	59.27045439669801
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears.	606.3896523724026
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed.	128.64438271695698
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council.	448.5569380418001
It is quite obvious to me, as someone who specialises in development policy, that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations.	240.97163545226437
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment.	232.3981610977868
Mr President, this morning' s debate is very important.	8.135463139614297
On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997.	597.2817535819097
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right.	129.03086077875906
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms.	135.94977880694339
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain.	789.262276840007
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union' s ability to match words with action.	395.6313783885453
For these are prerequisite to any development.	33.81051977963236
We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe' s status in the international system.	406.49004406750305
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa.	119.43739783080714
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues.	796.8183038613945
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks.	371.1810489209727
We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.	414.30732968155024
Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them.	212.33907554421006

These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	196.59914877300557
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.	203.86805260484263
In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction.	188.95977063975886
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged" for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector.	894.7136302370715
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament.	182.01255054467669
. (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market.	365.24299607428514
(PT) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas, such as NOW, on new opportunities for women, HORIZON, for disabled persons, YOUTHSTART, for promoting the labour market integration of young people, and INTEGRA, for groups threatened with exclusion. Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations.	664.2303785581132

In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.	297.96706630734406
The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights.	387.16093650242317
I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support.	457.3491255752611
I hope that Parliament's participation in the Geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence. First and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects I have just mentioned as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation, and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place.	658.3149043073082
Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs Malmström put it.	363.7509498138152
Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this.	33.62739042357
Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever.	547.3401721200535
Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated.	593.8875723766945

Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished.	623.8987991709835
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	137.09679326278209
I hope we can have further debates like this.	20.279205915176444
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus;	55.38234271877494
There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year.	254.77094452131277
This representative has already contacted all these parties and has, in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds.	197.6810798267584
The position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations.	445.8423870675452
However, I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution.	41.57474856984163

Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility.	317.5797117176685
To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report.	169.78108066848444
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	78.86580149972502

If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	345.3150664873117
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission.	469.28905076644435
With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies.	615.5612667509488
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.	383.24212016223794
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	325.3414097587266
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that.	13.619304733568852
But where will you place the emphasis?	191.4826892108003
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	123.52034156882159
We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic' s forces in Kosovo.	1320.828933307294
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	125.70552917865281
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	431.11757175998866

I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	24.71003111649976
The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far.	659.1322627315867
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	31.68258284114882
With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.	198.47567071127722
This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.	24.8730141603644
You are most welcome.	20.40046590820713
I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria.	110.5969650841292
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	183.59793180312627
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world.	102.3274583341872
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	35.09373273293803
The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.	505.3578332705213
I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.	511.75090492698513
That is important, for at least three reasons.	24.617194385435432
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter.	169.74720694681116
We must put a stop to this trend.	18.385088192502963
With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application.	192.38596830427872
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	68.0846918348286
The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans.	483.48750151786106
It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there.	208.30937078365528
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money.	130.9679439427699
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur.	38.38144755944205
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	550.2699112667538
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.	217.26863313543316
They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc.	518.0310063731719
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence.	529.2008938628038
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	249.71788348722106
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated.	153.461210742699
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade.	361.0461382705739
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	119.25486671341523
Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement.	607.7016731440211
Mr President, the agreement we are debating today, as analysed by Mr Swoboda, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, constitutes the second politically positive step, after the stability pact for the area.	146.73933997074823
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators.	574.5813108435275
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	188.34132724035146
A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.	670.0370975922172
The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council.	466.9144664111221
Mr Corbett set out Parliament' s concerns.	52.25642103437521
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied.	102.53809976554703
We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.	64.14066551271601
From the Commission' s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni.	46.387031128808296
We know the Member States have done their duty - if I can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with ESA 95, and they have already published their corresponding estimates.	439.4743122457873
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States' government deficits.	699.0374959356172
Firstly, for the single market.	16.43654167034524
Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits.	171.8747142981633
That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People' s Party, the ÖVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The ÖVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here.	227.19368406454635
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.	257.6725547591743
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	197.35619289499502
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others.	352.6818288209416
Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery.	149.55932713904778
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.	426.22116910715
Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros?	1659.0296058068643
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour.	227.91199119293827
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)	11.067357340288424
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.	14.296000520597037
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for.	133.85984789322794
There are different views on this.	9.428912390129344
However, instead of imposing a new regime, we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime.	345.57501091202175
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	876.6359466624675
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse.	1186.3645734876864
In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets.	509.248109563207
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.	148.47892463555084
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.	54.34314685082344
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.	597.5291427494303
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.	253.26177578043234
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks.	636.6564912237095
Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused.	202.14544382936336
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	803.7649246845307
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	62.73354713894556
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.	49.90616894152787
Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council.	462.48912718611564
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	99.70693458185944
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion.	506.3247914106999
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English.	49.25359194343789
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.	67.71615606972476
By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point.	1155.0554950129883
This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed.	414.62596330074973
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate.	168.05841197122763
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.	1365.037764415609
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today.	81.3207536480142
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	21.06265793782734
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted.	45.747251685380434
If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation.	60.13938280725636
It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust.	271.2982318617963
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance.	292.81977988201487
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.	174.38758914799593
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	78.39062294461787
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision.	95.41261132131743
Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version.	72.17273036373138
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.8566205876051747
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	70.99376203849614
Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away.	1046.4931969863196
On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.	327.9297621168503
What should this global actor' s objective be?	140.07553627852386
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	1682.7296299208513
Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	551.4070670640973
.	2.5013122860961254
It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner.	96.11715406266386
Although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to ACP-EU relations, the European Union also plans to police immigration, as article 13 hints, in order to justify the policy of the European states against illegal immigrants.	832.652187634074
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products.	194.83852183069007
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness.	211.03288359359982
Through the agreement, the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty.	208.81376280148723
In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.	473.69894533908484
First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.	648.6928832354524
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.	277.2817186094579
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed.	326.5192431324707
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.	673.6643138517653
I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs.	74.32693338888593
Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.	202.9718771866215
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields.	382.1920737933103
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	612.4453749600352
Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	964.1167880484396
Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour.	359.7011087695019
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	879.4870399080554
I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.	1361.6450585864438
Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out.	312.4018009859091
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	2228.823700591011
This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out.	502.2714346300952
It is only, as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed.	822.3593830512827
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads' . It seems to me a fitting description of them.	419.6873469612906
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on.	230.01894094236422
The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	2133.8532856830943
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us.	75.95135035287224
They ask us where their children are, their sons.	258.06606484178457
Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible.	93.8496594785749
This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.	392.18718592976563
Once again, an indigenous people' s right of existence is being threatened.	161.29204903394557
But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope.	73.66738540719906
Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life.	274.41734364057936
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things.	29.56275614298624
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives.	1108.6688375342778
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes.	568.4562458251669
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict.	751.0869131823458
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.	616.7060422251614
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	48.80197431310834
We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe.	229.85162141261438
Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe.	100.48767965988303
Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards.	459.6216324356776
My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.	676.7125293382311
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.	558.8050200099028
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl.	1488.407949466421
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it.	621.5421129637712
It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry.	384.8972728918403
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development.	109.78402968983009
We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament.	254.61165336652203
It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied.	81.02544002638025
As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for.	182.89884217535064
In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches.	813.1768942431162
Since then, however, there has been no progress.	30.334177718648625
The Commission expects Member States to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming.	424.8145336175777
Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers.	55.83607893472625
I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades.	183.28174469969932
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)	23.317671070813482
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU's financial support for less well-off regions.	81.54303036013069
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services.	429.827252171435
That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector.	57.323561156859604
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade.	717.4129853903127
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.	9.337520282343043
Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days.	288.7536682761072
The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third.	275.31503328100615
Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.	111.34853869911336
In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices.	116.85309002745
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	353.3554622880684
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.	288.7487044218839
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services.	210.09441087599146
They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.	1015.1945176990928
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.	526.0114527516077
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites!	342.46698457064673
Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.	1118.931901389652
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe.	410.27622686101955
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.	1542.6306928406914
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999.	106.38826019495546
Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology.	690.9126255856478
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.	803.7369079597024
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold.	199.79693510977106
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed.	749.7498269112466
The post office is democracy.	26.80327707276636
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards.	97.08484729127218
We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers' needs continues.	667.2584219511183
That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.	331.66859029339645
We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning.	318.32905227837637
The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services.	57.18401074952128
If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected.	214.21371910814707
.	2.5013122860961254
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.	194.72802310767705
(The Minutes were adopted)	9.877417140289435
The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.	205.82026334486812
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House.	369.53499462452237
Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners?	495.76331749255866
On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.	463.2359309282537
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	219.7782446428565
My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union.	82.41703152366834
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.	696.7519590721627
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.	43.41239258049909
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	377.7613720770929
My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?	694.1299984278602
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.	910.0591768763903
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good?	182.8343111427466
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	124.47215230255628
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.	125.30321642435999
I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?	92.69000568719007
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	480.32415901762994
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	127.80605535463214
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	26.18185149705284
He is a driven man, a competent man.	168.250776101242
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.	144.57738033052388
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.	128.41643395146306
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.	68.63624671003186
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.	279.7533111475882
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.	347.869951123154
For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment.	584.5331149825637
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf.	916.2343208783097
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.	256.27708645305256
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.	343.24836883095514
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	151.4322738194764
I am anxious to know how effective the EU' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.	51.587262068162815
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	101.09958844322819
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.	518.0250500340908
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.	82.57017649923537
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.	224.41054028364488
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?	83.11755792033325
Do not take too long to send it back.	57.12465231835834
I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she.	603.1595194427101
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices.	144.05335871724068
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making.	634.390564520435
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.	33.52405694437431
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.	233.47224551123173
The debate is a deeply political one.	29.291482466635347
The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure.	1574.006598724493
Several people have lost their lives, many have disappeared, many have been injured.	420.8194451441793
Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society.	263.3012850308336
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon.	683.8016263893783
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent.	232.05399627354538
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far?	354.90021371851395
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources.	443.16968466798386
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured.	407.77808765123837
Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure.	193.04782686417357
The debate is closed.	1.748735324687731
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].	66.07935012360107
The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001.	476.9820097149919
However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws.	82.28256240324059
Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union.	314.04054721847973
This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe.	89.78356721048664
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.	80.75117943297549
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union.	161.47504852490258
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy.	469.61181624779954
It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it.	254.40873355128682
It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment.	131.3526011391657
This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people.	235.73344181231002
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this.	92.3446424419131
We currently believe that this improvement, which we highlighted in the perspectives in November, may lead to even better results than initially forecast.	2917.0083241439593
When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth.	315.63217736569453
Parliament' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets.	77.33696301641619
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations.	409.8937244325039
In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly.	1791.270230641992
To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted.	215.44362543742366
The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal.	319.43595614115173
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.678276468010708
The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle.	152.8801645717663
However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA.	94.39673353472024
The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals.	297.1171274114442
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.	180.94054660575645
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations.	135.53599946997304
Fishing and the environment (Bergen 13-14 March 1997): 2nd report	549.8847280164546
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect, perhaps more so than most people, both Europeans and non-Europeans, would believe.	438.680356389989
In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries.	1133.142672699405
Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.	307.3800790271909
One can quote from the communication.	48.77389174322168
That appeared in the communication published last July.	419.5087550692929
In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures.	763.8499204222663
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector.	544.15184903777
But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual.	147.91739790490595
I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions.	400.3964362753655
In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors.	523.7436437968807
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings.	43.17519741157692
In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient.	248.96958229554363
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.	6.264580228448318
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained?	624.1160889045018
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked.	143.9094467115001
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	191.6349469476052
Some of them have already lost several years' worth of harvests, but the 50% to 80% slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline, and even those in the Channel and North Sea.	1026.577832924779
