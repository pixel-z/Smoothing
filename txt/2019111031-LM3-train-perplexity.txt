Although there are a few isolated reports in the literature suggesting that sugar beet pollen is highly antigenic, hypersensitivity to components of sugar beet is not a common disease.	3.221084356541543
We report a 29-year-old man with a history of atopic dermatitis who developed both contact dermatitis and allergic rhinitis from sugar beet pollen through his job in a seed nursery.	3.006349430474072
Establishing nursing science at German universities has become more and more consolidated.	3.65556373737523
At the beginning of this establishment there was an evident backlog especially compared to angloamerican and scandinavian countries.	2.7971125680364546
Today - 1997 - more than 40 nursing science courses exist at German high schools and universities.	2.888103923435412
Active glucocorticoids (GCS), such as cortisol or corticosterone, are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung.	3.841872739652875
In fetal serum, biologically inactive metabolites (cortisone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone) outweigh the active forms.	2.7899092272360297
The inhibition of 11-HSD by the licorice extract glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibits this central metabolism.	2.794318316703202
On the other hand, GCS induce the reductive activity of 11-HSD and, therefore, they increase their own activation by positive feedback.	2.7977385684927785
In a community sample of 394 eldery aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed.	3.159193224413583
Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed.	2.8191141678848908
The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person.	3.9103159730278008
In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time.	3.0632076107846986
88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year.	3.6968946911288407
55.8% took at least one medicine each day.	3.943924693175864
The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine.	3.1433787690766946
Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor.	3.3015812447167887
Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life.	3.5825214396663156
Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support.	3.5621955990839216
There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine.	3.4321828115090134
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) are chronic inflammatory and frequently relapsing diseases of the gut that ultimately lead to destruction of the intestinal tissue.	3.135115670337731
Recent evidence suggests that a pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of IBD.	3.775340365568776
Furthermore, changes in cell migration and cytokine production appear to contribute to the perpetuation of IBD and the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.	3.357312623906611
Based on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD, several new therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical practice, including recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-, IL-10, IL-11) and inhibitors of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM), proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-12) and their receptors (TNF, IL-6R).	3.841758238305368
Dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	3.302478049935762
A defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response.	3.363313231311396
Experimental findings in apoptotic keratinocytes and C1q knock-out mice suggest an important role of C1q in the clearance of apoptotic cell material.	3.438084405504461
In addition, there are several links between C1q and SLE: Most the patients with C1q deficiency develop a SLE-like syndrome.	3.1674942381557734
SLE itself often causes secondary C1q deficiency and autoantibodies to C1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis.	3.6502222534529793
These observations suggest a central role of C1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of SLE.	4.131350622108282
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the causes and accident mechanisms that lead to injuries in infancy involving buggies and prams in order to establish strategies for accident prevention.	2.973618909338782
The discussion about the implementation of telemedicine and teleresourcing and its consequences has been under way for some time now.	3.059328398394239
The rate at which telemedical applications are being developed, leaves little time for consideration of the economic, scientific and social aspects.	3.337795020129459
There is a need for integration of all the existing fragments into one coherent telemedical concept.	3.1036176859721247
Different aspects of telemedical concepts are discussed.	3.0105463621713753
A 34-year-old woman who was separated from her husband, was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest.	2.654551769093303
The post-mortem examination was carried out approximately 5 h after death.	3.584447558418783
At the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken.	3.086050964905293
Additionally, a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her polo-neck pullover.	3.0677218324882642
It was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a fabric pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim.	3.6886910217528475
DNA typing (short tandem repeat-PCR) of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect.	3.9255653782053552
A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of self-reinforced absorbable composites (Biofix) in the fixation of ankle fractures.	4.577386180693637
The benefits of Biofix rods and screws are: a reduction in costs since no secondary operation is needed, prevention of stress-shielding and thereby diminishing the risk of bone porosity.	3.4886918431792098
Patients aged between 16 and 75 years old with closed, non-comminuted fractures of the lateral and/or medial malleolus and dislocation of the fracture fragments greater thean 2 mm were included in the study.	4.091649900153599
22 patients were treated with Biofix rods and screws and the control group of 19 patients with a standard technique.	5.227231807542842
After 3, 6 and 12 months, rontgenograms were taken.	3.925169527153106
At the same time functional results were evaluated following the criteria of Olerud and Molander.	3.3249755364389637
Two patients were withdrawn from the trial for non-medical reasons.	3.3825785807264848
22 patients (12 from the Biofix group, 10 from the AO group) operated two or more years ago were contacted to see if any complications had occured since they were last seen.	3.0534253449220623
In 4 cases a Biofix screw broke down just beneath the head during insertion.	2.727085222537884
This did not result in an insufficient fixation of the fracture.	4.177398302443219
There were no early post-operative complications.	3.3342553153197954
The functional and rontgenological results in both groups were equal.	3.7231057281850175
In three cases a sterile sinus developed at the site of screw insertion.	3.3232980063245283
Biofix rods and screws, made of polylactic acid, are a good alternative for the fixation of fractures of the ankle.	4.535494380990335
The use of resorbable fracture fixation material has the advantage that a second operation to remove osteosynthesis material is not necessary.	3.1609276391226415
The long term results are good.	3.9019002820483295
There is, however, a possibility of development of tissue reaction to the resorbable material.	3.8753478374799513
In current textbooks of dermatology, lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular, intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology.	3.2931029058534813
When this concept was developed, there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid.	4.114728314395761
It is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins, as it is in systemic amyloidoses, but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes.	2.944575217700387
Even several years ago, chronic scratching was invoked as a possible cause of damage to keratinocytes in lichen amyloidosus.	3.392913356980128
In support of this hypothesis, four cases are presented.	3.672056993182739
Apart from amyloid in the papillary layer, all biopsy specimens revealed histopathological signs of chronic scratching (epithelial hyperplasia with hypergranulosis and compact orthokeratosis, coarse collagen in vertical streaks in the stratum papillare), such as are also found in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus.	2.776086922940752
Lichen amyloidosus is considered to be a variant of these conditions.	4.184350166608514
Just as in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus, pruritus seems to be the cause and not a symptom of the papular skin lesions.	2.9854229304781463
Consequently, treatment of lichen amyloidosus should not be directed at removing amyloid, but at improving the pruritus.	3.515455619409947
Ulcers in chronic venous insufficiency, especially in postthrombotic syndrome, are often resistant to compression therapy.	4.132936235343378
They can be treated effectively by the dermatologic surgeon with a fairly simple operative procedure.	3.0542360735033256
The removal of the ulcer together with the extensive lipodermatosclerosis by Humby knife (shave-therapy) and immediate grafting with a meshed split skin graft - possibly in combination with ligation of insufficient perforator veins - yields very good success rates.	3.1693134801077676
The results in 13 patients (18 legs) with an average follow up period of 11 months (up to 20 months) are reported.	4.781317349443866
The literature from 1990-1997 and 3 personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites.	3.277726740522873
Bites of the adder (Vipera berus) are rare.	3.1865678497569996
Symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution, death due to adder bite is rare.	2.8698347175144048
The main venom effect is the development of - sometimes severe - edema, hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy, very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure.	3.150844663180762
Significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2-3 h after the incident, no signs of intoxication can be found.	3.598675604326244
Background: The use of high-tech communication is undoubtedly growing and has become established in almost all sciences and research fields.	3.267615838728991
This article surveys the possibilities for scientific data-exchange via the Internet, the world's largest computer network.	2.951750951052836
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are known to exhibit far less cardiac side effects than tricyclic antidepressants.	3.272799294008499
We report three cases in which the SSRI, paroxetine, induced clinically relevant ECG changes in patients with high risk profile.	3.574787352371674
In two cases an increase in QTc time was observed, severe bradycardia was also observed twice.	3.709253609068253
Objective: Cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is not very helpful in the management of patients with whooping cough, since culture takes three to five days until results are available, and only about 30-60% of patients may be detected by this method.	3.889016494792643
In order to improve the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough, different protocols for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed.	2.844017850530524
With the introduction of each new technique for registering eye movements, the question arises concerning whether these provide a reliable and accurate alternative for the  diagnosis of labyrinthine dysfunction when compared to the most commonly used electro-oculographic technique.	3.847799702202588
To answer this question we compared mean slow-phase velocity (SPV) using three different recording techniques: electro-oculography (EOG), video-oculography (VOG) and infra-red oculography (IROG) during four different types of examinations.	2.822057058064916
The examinations were the eye target tracking test (ETT), horizontal and vertical optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) tests and the rotating chair test of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR).	2.7829267224989263
For the ETT tests the VOG provided consistently higher mean SPV values with low variance, presumably because of the accuracy and stability of the calibration.	3.5103756909157835
For the horizontal OKN and VOR rotating chair tests no significant differences were found between the mean SPV obtained with the different recording techniques, although the IROG recordings were associated with a larger variance.	3.915446959418743
Vertical OKN mean SPV was consistently lower with IROG and VOG techniques presumably because of non-linearities and resolution limitations inherent in these techniques.	3.181283687731434
These results indicate that the EOG technique despite its disadvantages of noise, time to apply and variability of calibration still provides an inexpensive, reliable and accurate means of measuring slow-phase eye movements.	3.1149487932462923
Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of the circulating adhesion molecules sICAM-1 and sE-selectin could serve as early predictors of developing sepsis and its severity.	2.962667579932197
Problem: The data model given in the  DICOM standard is examined unter the aspect of system integration.	3.070160714143704
Semantic properties of the IODs (information object definitions) and their relationships are investigated.	3.69160648960212
Thoracic disc herniation is rare.	3.2663081161313583
Pain is the most common initial symptom, followed by sensory disturbances and motor involvement.	3.8837834347446534
By the time of diagnosis, 90% of the patient have signs of spinal cord compression.	4.555608214032412
A 42-year-old woman was operated on because of shoulder pain.	3.209653302415021
During her stay in hospital, the patient first demonstrated uncharacteristic pain and after 2weeks an incomplete paraplegia caused by herniation of the T10/11 disc.	3.2649323403578734
Degenerative changes have been considered to be a cause for spontaneous quadriceps tendon rupture.	4.02259165879676
Aim of this study is to investigate the microvasculature of the quadriceps tendon by injection techniques and immunohistochemical methods (antibodies against laminin) with regard to the pathogenesis of tendon degeneration.	3.9694615100144777
The blood supply of the quadriceps tendon arises from descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, by branches of the descending geniculate artery and by branches of the medial and lateral superior geniculate arteries.	3.437923363769445
Compared to the surrounding synovial layer, the amount of vessels in the tendon substance is greatly reduced.	3.2253587332335445
The distribution of blood vessels within the quadriceps tendon is not homogenous.	3.1074416101995417
The anterior or superficial part of the tendon has a complete vascular network that extends from the musculo-tendinous junction to the patella.	3.2901884072456924
Within the deep portion of the quadriceps tendon there is an oval shaped avascular area which measures app.	3.2369546476341844
30 mm in length and app.	3.5396723649645145
An explanation for the absence of blood vessels may be compressive stress caused by the patellar groove which serves as hypomochlion for the quadriceps tendon when the knee is flexed.	3.5058242747984463
The occurrence of an avascular zone within the deep layer of the tendon that is directed to the joint cavity may explain the frequency of degenerative changes in this region.	3.649602793448197
When looking for the possible cause of distortions in values measured for the determination of breath ethanol concentration (BEC) in artificially respirated patients, consideration must be given to the humidity and temperature of the gas examined.	3.2771595347767657
In the present study, the effects of humidified and warmed and of dry and cold air on the accuracy of a newly developed BEC measuring device, as compared to a reference model and to a conventional system, were examined in a lung model.	3.6347278596106563
Total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following Le Fort I osteotomy in CLP patients are frequent and major complications.	3.124161479365644
The aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement.	3.342656933686079
Maxillary distraction was performed in 12 patients.	4.437405958739884
In two cases, a Delaire mask was used to bring the maxilla forward, ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by Polley.	3.569199119185441
In all patients, planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved; one partial relapse occurred.	3.0824985129180518
The results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability.	3.3366743020375114
The technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure.	3.3267660480171353
We report a rare case of primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult.	3.0912505470824314
A huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62-year-old man.	3.059901583730606
The patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until 4 days before admission to hospital.	2.880375716551247
Histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round-cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered Homer-Wright rosettes.	2.864896790654996
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with O13, a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein p30/32MIC2.	2.9271692503363416
Focally, tumour cells stained positively for vimentin, NSE, S-100 protein and synaptophysin.	3.074203096351665
The patient died 3 weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge, partly exophytic but mainly endophytic tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue.	3.093337188434642
The differential diagnosis of small round-cell tumours in this location is discussed.	3.5530132617371972
Lesions of the acetabular labrum should be treated by correcting the causes.	3.7937548009366995
In a steep acetabulum where the femoral head brings the acetabular labrum under tension and traction, the acetabulum should be rotated by triple pelvic osteotomy to slightly overcorrected acetabular measurements.	2.965845578502621
Severely diminished acetabular and femoral anteversion can also lead to tears and impingement of the labrum.	3.2208133258426273
Then rotation of the femoral neck and/or rotations of the acetabulum by triple osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion are indicated.	3.9906991241417145
Our triple osteotomy technique differs from that of others mainly in the ischial osteotomy.	3.3037383673800305
It is performed from the posterior approach between the sciatic notch next to the ischial spine and the obturator foramen and is directed 20-30  ° anteriorly from the frontal (coronal) plane.	3.1128534119654367
The osteotomies therefore are placed close enough to the acetabulum to allow free rotation, but they do not interfere with the circulation of the acetabulum, and the ligaments between the sacrum and ischium are left in normal tension.	3.55674970970345
Our normal values of the acetabular position were tested by correlating the measurements with the absence of pain.	3.848109005861495
The optimum is reached with a CE angle and a VCA angle of 30-35  °, an angle of the weight-bearing zone of +5 to -5  ° and a migration index of 10-15 %.	3.4452294103512124
Overcorrections again caused pain and should be avoided.	3.63412724314046
Diminished anteversion of femur and acetabulum towards 0  ° also caused pain and should be corrected by triple and femoral osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion.	3.0136453680514603
Survival rate curves regarding the absence of pain demonstrated that pain was experienced again when joints were corrected insufficiently or overcorrected, while in good corrections the joints were free of pain in about 75 %.	3.248134243886839
Background: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is associated with point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that appear to be pathogenic for this disease.	3.3447822731870716
These mutations affect nucleotide positions 3460, 11 778 and 14 484.	2.917041379065807
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) is an immunoglobulin-mediated, drug-induced side effect for heparin-treated patients with thromboembolic complications.	3.84696537076917
With HIT type II the thrombocytopenia is often a harbinger of thromboembolic complications in the venous or arterial system.	3.4295414476594743
If HIT type II is suspected, further heparin exposure is to be stopped immediately and another anticoagulant therapy should be started.	3.826304778788325
The two anticoagulant options in Germany are discussed.	3.354038107019401
At the same time the diagnosis should be confirmed by laboratory testing, including testing for cross-reactivity with danaparoid.	3.2747486745118906
Further therapy depends on the symptoms.	3.9243053976653375
In the case of clinical relevance of this disorder we should think about prophylaxis: strict indications for perioperative prophylaxis only use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for routine prophylaxis, use of LMWH for thrombosis treatment and early change to cumarine.	3.1204428429383966
A patented low-temperature polymerization method for methylmethacrylate (MMA) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described: it has been developed from our previous MMA technique and is a patented procedure.	3.335594393390658
Differences from the previous method are (1) removal of stabilizer from the MMA monomer before its application, (2) the use of a different starter, (3) avoidance of O2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with N2, and (4) polymerisation in a water bath to draw off residual heat.	3.621035307506239
After this procedure, all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate.	3.4896092912467234
The effects of different fixatives are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis.	3.0154086711255754
Technically, this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification.	3.7997310495781567
The advantages over the latter method are: (1) the cells can be better differentiated because semi-thin sections can be made; (2) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semi-thin sections, which means they can be interpreted more easily; (3) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections; (4) osteological examination of bone trabeculae, especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies, is possible; (5) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved.	3.784871471586561
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below DM 100,000 including an excellent microtome.	2.973574651467385
The routine use of succinylcholine for endotracheal intubation is being increasingly questioned.	3.5202084712256885
Initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions.	3.4228599664909636
However, most of these initial studies either did not have a double-blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants.	3.709860149746129
In this study, intubation conditions using fentanyl/propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl/propofol/succinylcholine and sodium thiopental/succinylcholine.	3.097177170973024
Nosocomial pneumonia is still a common problem, especially in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.	4.755019359983723
The endotracheal tube contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in these patients, because it facilitates microaspiration and impairs host defense.	3.637042574336067
Common nosocomial pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to produce exopolysaccharides and generate a complex biofilm structure, which allows adhesion to abiotic surfaces and protection against antibiotic action.	3.050792150565594
Multiple studies have identified bacterial biofilm on the inner lumen of endotracheal tubes, which represents a permanent source of infectious material.	3.0698769508320534
It remains unclear whether this represents a source of infection or contamination.	3.453135657747754
Bacterial biofilm, however, may play an important role in recurrent pulmonary infections of the intubated and mechanically ventilated patient.	3.3895989979336782
Only the Robodoc procedure allows the precise execution of the preoperative plan in surgery.	3.259420566691341
Robot-assisted surgery has been undergoing clinical evaluation at the Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik, Frankfurt, since November 1994.	3.284371998900211
In all 465 patients, the preoperative plan was successfully carried out intraoperatively.	3.7184017128754974
The high precision in reaming, leading to a superb bone implant contact, guarentees absolute initial stability and is likely to promote primary healing between implant and bone.	3.125028785775306
The common and often published incidence of varus or valgus malpositioning and any fractures or fissures could be avoided through the use of Robodoc.	3.3107130751773495
Although immediate full-weight bearing was strongly recommended to the patients, no implant subsidence was seen in the regular follow-up X ray studies.	4.369637125013249
In this study we describe 22 cases of retrograde ureteral stent placement in pregnant women with therapy-resistant flank pain due to hydronephrosis.	2.8991241636078446
Eleven were primiparous and one patient expected twins.	3.4539774874780633
Eight of 22 patients presented symptoms of pyelonephritis.	3.3390304349837856
In 21 cases the hydronephrosis was located on the right and in 4 cases it was bilateral.	4.374852514291458
Maximal lower calix diameter was 12 mm (range 9-22 mm).	3.169157527699209
All patients were painfree within 6 days and were given prophylactic low dosis of antibiotic until the day of delivery.	3.0817956190865265
Renal function remained within the normal limits.	3.3303213908073537
Double-J stent displacement occured in 3 patients - of which one underwent nephrostomy.	3.4473279600494444
Postnatal examination demonstrated urolithiasis in 4 of 19 patients.	3.834855734957396
This study provides evidence for effectiveness of retrograde ureteral Double-J stent placement as a therapeutic option in cases of severe symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy with a low morbidity rate.	3.401084087134555
Between 1981 and 1994 at the Bergmannsheil Ruhr University Hospital in Bochum, Germany, we treated 145 patients with femoral diaphyseal nonunions following initial operative treatment.	3.4167988055998673
Of these patients, 138 received this initial operative treatment at an outside institution.	3.179032969279494
The primary reconstructions for the fractures utilized plates in 112 cases, reamed nails in 24 cases and external fixators in 9 cases.	3.051066402699941
The average age of the patients was 35 years and the mean time from the initial operative treatment was 2 years.	4.096694432967477
Twenty-seven patients (19 %) presented with a hypertrophic nonunion and 118 (81 %) with an atrophic nonunion.	3.466635239241329
There was a significant correlation between primary "classic" plating and development of an atrophic nonunion (2-test: P < 0.01).	3.5452892255813437
We observed 34 wound infections (23 %) with no significant correlation to the type of primary osteosynthesis.	4.060567383074088
We determined that 73 of the pseudarthroses were due to improper osteosynthesis techniques.	3.0871178725676143
Of these cases, 41 % involved the use of plates, 83 % involved the use of reamed nails, and 78 % involved the use of external fixators.	3.9703056866680737
Fracture location near the diaphyseal-metaphyseal junctions was common in this problematic group.	2.9576584020597285
Ninety-two percent of all plates led to atrophic nonunions.	2.88643527129365
There were 21 open fractures and of these 90 % (n = 19) developed an atrophic pseudarthrosis and 29 % (n = 6) developed a wound infection.	3.184283454787969
Fifty-seven (39 %) of all patients had additional injuries, but we found that did not increase the risk of disturbed bone healing.	3.884624335024555
Our revision operations focused on the elimination of wound infections, refreshment of bone healing, and improvement in fragment stability.	3.4809434074265186
Only 28 % of all "classic" plates and 11 % of all external fixators were changed to an intramedullary implant at the time of the first revision surgery.	3.4452262068086825
Hypertrophic nonunions required a mean of 1.3 revision operations to achieve bone healing whereas a mean of 2 revision operations were necessary to fuse atrophic bone ends (P < 0.05).	3.2061954077374897
In cases of diaphyseal pseudarthrosis healing time was not affected by the type of osteosynthesis used for primary reconstructions.	3.40096061962236
Since lack of fracture healing can often already be observed directly from postoperative X-rays, we recommend that revision procedures be performed early.	3.4396106608900894
The prolonged length of time to care for femoral nonunions underlines the importance of appropriate primary fracture treatment.	3.1608688073894564
That takes into consideration both the biomechanical and the biological aspects of bone healing.	3.475129741861234
Methods: Patients with a local recurrence after curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with 100 µg of octreotide three times a day and tamoxifen 20 mg once daily.	3.6634708888142415
The median survival time, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-30) and side effects of the octreotide-tamoxifen group were compared with a historic cohort (n = 14) of patients treated in our department (9/95-9/96) according to the "best supportive care" concept.	3.8261370309753517
Results: Recurrences were diagnosed after R0 resection in a mean time of 13  +/-  6.8 months.	3.6933213589527796
Patients treated with octreotide and tamoxifen had a significantly (P < 0.05) longer median survival time (7 months; range: 3-12) vs 3.5 months; range: 1.5-5).	3.7002067340220144
The octreotide-tamoxifen group suffered less from lack of appetite, nausea, fatigue, and pain and needed fewer analgesies.	3.002773217260582
The only side effect of the octreotide-tamoxifen therapy was moderate diarrhoe in 2 patients at the beginning of the therapy.	3.6335765643782985
Conclusion: Since combined therapy with octreotide and tamoxifen can be administered comfortably for outpatient treatment, this seems to represent progress in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer.	3.258565617034427
Objective: To study the influence of dopexamine on pulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during major thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV).	3.1693950003804496
Design: Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study.	3.33254821385116
Patients: Twenty adult patients undergoing elective pulmonary resection.	3.411604312120883
Anaesthesia: General anaesthesia was performed using propofol, fentanyl, N2O and vecuronium.Volume-controlled ventilation was performed to maintain normocapnia over the whole investigation period.	3.6897265427159094
During OLV, the tidal volume was reduced and the respiratory rate was increased to avoid a peak airway pressure exceeding 40 cm H2O.	3.296503149674334
Furthermore the FiO2 was increased to 1,0 and the external PEEP was removed during OLV.	3.748286903278256
Interventions: The patients received either dopexamine at 2 µg/kg/min (group A, n=10) or 0,9% saline as control (group B, n=10) after assessing the baseline values.	4.101247147651338
Measurement and results: The following cardiorespiratory variables were recorded: Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure.	3.2841943994099605
Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution using a continuous cardiac output thermodilution catheter.	3.452995414422749
Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index, pulmonary vascular resistance index, oxygen delivery index (DO2I), oxygen consumption index and the venous admixture were calculated using standard formula.	3.2941067255083403
Furthermore, pressure-flow-curves were constructed to analyse flow independent changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance.	3.5127740796688998
Data were recorded at the following times: After induction of anaesthesia in stable haemodynamics during two-lung ventilation (baseline values, T0), intraoperatively during one-lung ventilation (T1) and postoperatively after re-establishing two-lung ventilation (T2).	2.8080068172355093
Patients characteristics, data from the preoperative lung function testing and surgical procedures did not differ significantly between the groups.	3.9314334978345014
CI increased in the dopexamine group from 2,5 +/- 1,2 l - min-1 - m-2 (T0) to 3,6 +/- 0,9 l - min-1 - m-2 (T1) and 4,0 +/- 1,3 l - min-1 -  m-2 (T2).	3.342047681185101
The course of the intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting did not differ between the groups.	3.086516089974759
In the dopexamine-treated group the DO2I increased from 430 +/- 143 ml - min - m-2 (T0) to 652 +/- 255 ml - min - m-2 (T1) and 653 +/- 207 ml - min - m-2 (T2).	2.247274528985946
Regarding the pressure-flow-curves there was no difference during OLV between the two groups indicating no major blocking effect of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.	3.230795298228089
Conclusion: It is concluded that dopexamine can be used to improve haemodynamics and oxygen delivery during thoracic surgery without increasing venous admixture during one-lung ventilation.	3.1325703145937513
Functional cine MRI of the pelvic floor is a yet another modality in addition to various radiological fluoroscopic techniques.	3.6872235989113644
This article describes our own method in view of the recent literatur and provides morphometric reference values.	3.171550101720998
Background: The influence of cyanosis, and cardiac index in children with cyanotic heart disease on their growth velocity.	3.670314242280754
Regular examinations of prostitutes may reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in this high risk group.	3.953681004944397
Therefore since April 1988 regular mandatory examinations have been offered by the regional health office in cooperation with the Department of Dermatology of the Ruhr-University of Bochum.	3.1665152141286264
The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of such an examination.	2.744105824979666
The study was based on anonymous questionnaires.	3.3920866960985925
Mean age of the 80 prostitutes was 31.4; 67 of then were born in Germany.	3.031437342930158
78 of the women always used condoms, while 71 thought that condoms prevent STDs.	3.3619083917757973
The majority the women (75 from this 80 prostitutes) did not perceive the examination as discrimination, while 71 felt the examinations were of high quality.	3.266297873251639
These results indicate that regular mandatory examinations should be part of health prevention care of prostitutes and that they are well accepted and tolerated by these women.	3.082348633650093
Atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery.	3.160181289445415
As more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases, the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again.	3.767185870083116
There are some unresolved problems of this complication.	3.242029855575313
Reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature.	3.7948358832773645
Usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient, self-limiting, and benign.	4.055481816397796
Nevertheless, among patients affected by this arrhythmia, morbidity, mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication.	3.139685774320485
In addition, postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself.	2.9900257266385895
Today, general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future.	4.051859500212704
According to the clinical course, therapy has to consider ventricular rate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control.	3.578124564626759
Usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time.	3.6963565938736878
Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery has to be respected in order to minimize overall complication rate.	4.2081037300761075
The influence of aspirin treatment on haemostasis is still under debate.	2.8615730234841927
There are doubts in emergency operations, especially in transplant patients, concerning dosage and change in medication.	3.6064612104979514
Our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in German transplantation centres.	4.431917924980706
The question of transplant suitability, dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature.	3.3384873894468354
Some 92.11 % of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin.	3.8992934379234954
In these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in 34.2 % of the centres.	2.7638302858664963
An increased mortality has not been reported.	3.3905901149353883
Most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of 100 mg aspirin daily.	3.0511402142918986
Only 7.89 % of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin-treated patients.	3.174024065768106
Correctly indicated aspirin treatment (for cardiac arrhythmia, embolism, or thrombosis, for example) does not contraindicate renal transplantation (daily dosage up to 100 mg).	3.3342210204629206
In elective surgery, however, a preoperative change in medication is recommended, e. g., the heparin instead of aspirin.	3.8450414960404906
Full-thickness defects of the thoracic wall following tumor resection, irradiation damage or secondary wound healing in thoracic surgery require early interdisciplinary cooperation to achieve patient-specific treatment modalities.	3.444507766832034
Plastic surgical differential therapy allowing for sufficient soft tissue coverage, stabilisation of the thoracic wall and space filling in intrathoracic cavities, is presented and critically discussed.	3.2759478808426286
Incomplete anaesthesia is a major clinical problem both in single spinal and in single epidural anaesthesia.	3.6834389841600483
The clinical efficacy of epidural anaesthesia with augmentation (aEA) and combined epidural and spinal anesthesia (CSE) for cesarean section was investigated in a prospective randomized study on 45 patients.	3.1531547603428254
This retrospective study presents the results of 41 patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the Staatliche Orthopädische Klinik of the LMU München in the time between 31.10.1979 and 31.10.1994.	3.7069532673180006
It could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures, due to their variety, hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a differanciated therapeutic procedure.	3.1935960696328456
Among the operation methods the K-wire stabilisaton with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i.e.	3.2430450379857554
The K-wire without cerclage was used in two cases.	3.897928464517808
Twelfe fractures were treated with AO-plate-osteosynthesis.	3.9667807926384873
Three fractures had to be treated by resection, as they produced two pseudarthrosis and one serious AC-arthrosis during the conservative therapy.	3.7324602687156565
92,7% of the subjective results of the 41 checked up patients were good and very good.	3.9586149233458996
The clinical follow-up of 36 and the radiological follow-up of 33 patients revealed in 97% a good and very good outcome in the Boenisch-Score.	3.8581540146630915
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis are thought to stem from autoimmunological processes.	3.258892845258442
We describe a 14 year old female adolescent, in whom both diseases manifested almost at the same time.	3.5539303005822975
A prospective long-term follow-up study in patients who had had surgical therapy for renal hyperparathyroidism was launched to investigate the results of surgical treatment and to evaluate possible correlations between preoperative laboratory values and the course of the symptoms.	4.344249561275693
From August 1987 to December 1995, 79 patients underwent surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism.	3.7842518038907826
It was the first neck exploration for 72 patients.	3.2885491888171914
Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to a forearm was our preferred procedure (n = 67).	3.0729353288677634
The postoperative course of all patients is known.	3.995154213080186
We carried out one to nine reexaminations (median 4) in 74 of 79 patients.	3.117572238206714
The follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 5 years with a median of 18 months.	3.9664710097830205
After the operation transient hypocalcaemia occurred in 84.8 % of patients.	2.8606155507455315
Postoperative hypocalcaemia correlated negatively with the preoperative levels of alkaline phosphatase and intact parathyroid hormone.	3.048100543858137
Within the first month after surgery 60 % of the preoperatively affected patients completely recovered from pruritus, whereas the skeletal syndrome took longer to disappear.	3.210810175766396
One year after surgery 75 % of the patients with pruritus and 79 % of those with skeletal syndrome had became asymptomatic.	3.753460257464759
After total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation, patients with preoperatively elevated concentrations of alkaline phosphatase ( > 200 U/l) experienced faster relief from joint pain than patients with preoperatively normal concentrations (P = 0.0297).	3.3045689576500847
To date 4.5 % of the patients developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation.	3.6494241770802667
Morbidity of surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism is influenced by patients' risk factors.	3.7885185588368273
Postoperative hypocalcaemia correlates negatively with the grade of renal osteopathy at the time of operation.	3.441136617745908
Preoperative concentrations of alkaline phosphatase influence the rapidity of the relief from joint pain.	3.0137995890959597
Coronary artery stenosis with need for therapy is rarely seen in childhood.	3.5341877017593766
A 15-year-old girl with hypercholesterinaemia type II a was undergoing lipid aphereses therapy (once or twice a week) since she was 6 years old.	3.1361885354065544
Single stage urthroplasty with an onlay patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease.	3.2259084170464027
Using buccal mucosa, operative time is substantially reduced by using a two-team approach in which one team harvests the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and calibrates the stricture.	3.193209976361177
Excellent results can be expected using grafts urethral substitution in men with refractory bulbar strictures.	3.614485270254711
Focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed.	3.3988817499998434
For patients with long or dense strictures, grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques.	3.329602243198121
Background: As the slit-lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in-vivo examination and documentation of the multi-layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea, e. g. during wound-healing processes, our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (CLSO; Zeiss) into a high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system.	3.5676506312604155
In order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), as well as some in-vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).	3.558124283990139
From 3 years' experience with nearly 100 transinguinal preperitoneal mesh prosthesis (TIPP) repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia the indication, anesthesia, modification of the technique, and results are reported.	3.4460689650085126
After intraoperative classification of the hernia, the TIPP repair is indicated especially in large defects of the posterior wall (L/M III).	3.8307223646697395
The procedure is easily performed under local anesthesia.	3.0774043636767905
During 52 local TIPP repairs, conversion of anesthesia was never necessary.	3.0929926044434177
Important technical details include the requirement for a sufficient size of mesh (10 cm x 15 cm) and a certain caudal and cranial fixation of the prosthesis using at least three interrupted stitches for each.	3.607100966810965
Apart from an increased number of seromas (12 %) in the early postoperative period, the results of the TIPP are comparable with those obtained after Shouldice repair for recurrent hernia.	3.967594979442181
The rate of hematomas, infections, and testicular complications range between 1 % and 3 %.	3.3672320892969827
Considering the negative case selection of only large recurrent hernias, the TIPP repair reveals a favourably low 1-year recurrence rate of 1 %.	3.44514139612714
The permission of this induction as a coercive measure is controversial.	3.025196506047713
The policemen, the public prosecutor or the judge has to decide, whether the induction of emesis is really necessary, the physician has to declare the risks.	3.290176602678295
Especially when there are only a few drug-containers and the person is no professial "body-packer", non-invasive diagnostic ways also can lead the evidence of incorporated drugs.	3.6275629971769163
Rupture of the drug containers leads to acute intoxication and the physician must regard the person as his patient, he has to refuse the role as medical expert for the representatives of law.	3.160000662635501
The deformity in severe spondylolisthesis consists of two components: the parallel anterocaudad slip of the spondylolisthetic vertebra, and its tilt into kyphotic malposition.	2.8095525179830343
The influence of the two components is very different: the anterocaudad slippage has not much impact on the sagittal profile of the spine and is easily compensated for by a slight increase in lumbar lordosis.	3.802603733513941
The kyphotic deformity has a high impact on trunk imbalance and the sagittal profile.	3.390354187770727
There are two compensation mechanisms: hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine to its anatomical extremes and - if that is not sufficient - verticalisation of the sacral bone, performed by contracture of the hamstrings and uprighting of the pelvis around the hip joints.	3.0171639051634105
The latter mechanism is followed by functional disadvantages.	3.4328343003362125
Therefore, correction of the kyphosis of L5 may be considered during operative treatment if the lumbosacral kyphosis (angle delta) is less than 85  ° and the sacral inclination less than 35  °.	3.112152361717607
The diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities includes analysis of the geometry of the whole leg.	3.2828920734655203
The first step in the diagnostic process is a standardized physical examination.	3.5491670515066893
It provides valuable background information for an effective radiological diagnosis.	3.4301590805692412
Even with a thorough standardized physical examination it is not possible to define exactly the deformity or decide on an operative procedure.	3.451473480804186
The diagnosis of axis deviations in the frontal plane can be measured on a conventional plain X-ray of the whole leg.	3.345402314894963
In this view it is very important that the knee joints are in a true a. p. view independent on torsional deformities of the lower legs.	3.6883275459488334
Today the gold standard to measure the torsion and length of the lower extremities is the CT scan.	3.4276549502785754
However, the multitude of analytical methods for CT measurements described in the literature do not lend themselves readily to comparison; thus, it is difficult to identify a clear method of choice.	3.2595423128779775
Not every CT measurement is better than a physical examination.	3.4012414907430126
Evidence of reproducibility and accuracy is a prerequisite for useful interpretation of the results.	3.3769030914436584
Up to this point in the literature there are only reference values for the Ulm CT Method.	4.288389288467604
One alternative is the MR scan, which avoids radiological risks, but the reproducibility and accuracy of the MRI method are not as good as for the CT method.	3.686027718169773
Another alternative is ultrasound, where recent advances in the measurement of torsion and length of the lower extremities have proven competitive with or superior to the accuracy of MRI.	3.7320062419598727
The three-dimensional determination of the torsion and length of the lower extremities by ultrasound has now assumed a leading role in the non-radiological diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities in children and adolescents.	3.9730709530543873
This method furthermore is increasingly being used in preoperative planning of leg deformities in adults.	3.1476177783326826
Purpose: Management of organ-confined RCC is primarily surgical.	3.1876490480981445
Paramount use of ultrasound in modern medicine has been claimed to contribute significantly to an earlier detection of RCC thus better amenable for radical operation.	3.154810401622829
Other factors may have been strategies and general hospital care.	3.487791490712756
However, it remains unclear whether an extended lymph node dissection as suggested vy Robson in a seminal paper in the 1960th bears any therapeutic value.	2.9144537028189066
Selected patients with minor lower limb injuries and low risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), who required cast immobilizing and did not receive medical thrombosis prophylaxis, were included in a prospective study.	3.487983207617995
The decision to give not medical thrombosis prophylaxis depended on an concept of individualised prophylaxis for patients at risk for thromboembolism.	3.107707641260935
From March 1994 to March 1996 in 178 outpatients (118 men, 60 women, mean age 25,8 [16-39] years) a clinical examination and a colour-coded duplex sonography were performed after removel of the cast for detection of DVT of the lower limb.	3.269330324791096
A phlebographie was performed when thrombosis was suspected.	3.282534103564609
Two patients developed a one bundle thrombosis of the calf.	3.5249228622461644
Clinical appearance of lung embolism was not observed.	3.590382022014307
These results suggest, that low risk patients with minor injuries of the lower limb and plaster cast immobilisation do not need a medical thrombosis prophylaxis.	3.710861225608675
For the judgment of the quality of medical services and for the progress of clinical medicine the comparison of data and informations of the diagnostic and therapeutic process is demanded.	4.161861235853251
Therefore a systematic and concrete system of documentation should be implemented in every clinic, which consists of standard nomenclature, classification, instruments of outcome measure and documentation standards.	3.102866026361849
There are a group of problems and barriers which stand in the way of this goal.	3.131434686781476
It is useful to build a minimum basis data set which includes core criterias of clinical dokumentation in orthopedic surgery and include this in an information system so that all of these parts are considered and that a central and comparable data pool is offered for patient care, quality management and research.	3.1717645139606945
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was first introduced as an entity in the second edition of the WHO's "Histologic Typing of Salivary Gland Tumours" in 1991.	2.9121430410432887
This tumor was first described in 1990 by Ellis and Wiskovitch from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).	2.549546631437713
Basal cell adenocarcinoma accounts for about 2.9% of all salivary gland malignancies.	2.8103417983091163
More than 90% of the tumors are situated in the parotid gland.	3.801963842217289
Intraoral manifestations are known from case reports only.	3.620585031273057
Tumors of the palate have been mentioned in three cases.	3.4217850364990867
Histologically this tumor can be easily confused with basal cell adenoma and the solid basaloid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma.	3.0746147091205995
The case presented here is a middle-aged white woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.	3.5806008319949343
Therapy consisted of surgical extirpation with three-dimensional safety margins and histologically proven clear resection margins.	3.302431620407946
Knowledge at this point indicates that basal cell adenocarcinoma has a rather high probability of local recurrence (up to 50%) and a mostly lymphogenous metastatic potential for as long as  10 years after removal of the primary tumor.	4.107716443390608
Ten year survival is around 75%.	3.5215382288622523
Purpose: To study the incidence and shape of subclinical keratoconus with corneal topography in the fellow eye in the case of clinically, slit-lamp biomicroscopically and topographically diagnosed unilateral disease.	3.079475033016782
Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in industrialized countries.	3.9692078363008623
This is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population.	3.9086902213443366
Medical progress with application of conservative, surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases, but markedly increased the medical care costs.	3.4511993765227063
The result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine.	3.5793154971285053
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications.	3.1800487359980405
In patients with liver disease with portal hypertension, however, the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit bleeding is increased.	4.111566725188566
While the diagnosis is simple, several therapeutic options are available.	3.668885536657173
In most cases the bleeding comes from stomal varices, that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3% Ethoxyscerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel.	3.1536944901854342
The resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised.	3.4713598744894636
If bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered.	3.5743526658029667
Malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source.	3.3532690005712573
Objectives: The cardiotoxic properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in-vitro, as well as under in-vivio conditions.	3.6257196272661254
A further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies.	3.1375550170049578
The aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a ventriculocisternal perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic variabels and their reversability by wash-out with mock-CSF.	2.931766021613175
In recent years, our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has greatly expanded.	2.9810098625175314
This, in turn, has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain-injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage.	3.484130999224422
The present article focuses on the pathophysiology of TBI and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention.	3.1984740209831135
This study explored characteristic subjective experiences of schizophrenia.	2.972931487408261
A questionnaire for self-assessment of disturbances in several cognitive and perceptual areas (the Eppendorf Schizophrenia Inventory, or ESI) was constructed and administered to first-episode schizophrenics (SCHe, n=45), negative syndrome schizophrenics (SCHn, n=45), remitted schizophrenics (SCHr, n=24), depressives (DEP, n=43), alcoholics (ALK, n=48), obsessive-compulsive patients (ZWA, n=46), and healthy controls (KON, n=57).	2.866244419815604
Comparisons between the SCHe, SCHn, DEP, ALK, and ZWA groups and a subsequent factor analysis revealed four schizophrenia-specific dimensions: attention and speech impairment (AS), ideas of reference (IR), auditory uncertainty (AU), and deviant perception (DP).	2.9034174911629664
Further analyses suggested that the AS syndrome may represent a mediating vulnerability factor while IR, AU, and DP probably are reversible episode indicators.	2.9634522468178757
The results may contribute to refinements in the measurement of specific prepsychotic signs, thus facilitating the development of early intervention approaches.	3.733812297017308
Introduction: The conservative treatment of the most severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) can be sometimes frustrating.	4.71415172539771
Especially with an underlying autoimmunologic disorder, even the application of artificial tears as often as every 5 min may not prevent further damage to the ocular surface.	3.5043376312860524
A microvascular transplantation of the autologous submandibular gland (SG) can be performed by a maxillo-facial surgeon as an alternative approach for those cases.	3.8584297481805434
We report 2 years of ophthalmological experience with the results of this procedure.	4.775573002578639
Aims: The predominant cause of death due to oral cancer is the failure to control local tumor due to regional tumor recurrence.	3.6765851795171045
The sequelae of surgical resection and high-dose irradiation cause substantial changes in head and neck anatomy, leading to considerable problems in the early morphological detection of recurrent disease.	4.464004313904927
Therefore, this study evaluates the verification of cancer recurrence by means of its pathologic glucose metabolism.	3.77551333200702
Materials and methods: We reviewed a total of 50 [18F]-2-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) investigations performed in 44 patients who had undergone surgical resection of oral cancer.	3.7166299007044636
In 23 cases, re-staging (group A) was indicated due to suspicion of recurrent or secondary tumor manifestation.	3.1696683419913274
In 27 cases, PET served as a screening procedure (group B).	3.0417503512315687
Statistic evaluation included sensitivity, specifity, positive/negative predictive value and accuracy of 18FDG-PET for the detection of tumor manifestation.	3.546145081424025
Results: 18FDG-PET correctly identified 23 of 26 tumor sites (88%) in the re-staging group and 9 of 10 tumor sites (90%) in the screening group.	4.257982348241713
We encountered a total number of 16 false-positive foci with an increased 18FDG-uptake.	3.908642692760274
In 5 of these 6 patients, the PET findings for the latter tumor sites determined the patient's fate.	3.643999349307517
Specificity was 63% for local recurrence, 97% for secondary lymph node involvement and 90% for distant metastasis.	3.3642708265415013
Conclusion: According to these data, 18FDG-PET is the most effective diagnostic tool in the follow-up of oral cancer patients to date.	4.028729712087577
Due to the high prevalence of recurrent disease in the follow-up of oral cancer, either the detection of early recurrence or the identification of additional, incurable tumors may add substantially to a rational therapeutic management.	3.6532219165518267
We therefore recommend 18FDG-PET for screening and re-staging of recurrent oral cancer.	2.921134317566734
In over 80 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the Nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long-term results.	3.8354175318473933
Dysphagia, inability to belch or vomit as well as the gas bloat syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication.	3.364157519271124
The frequency of these symptoms could be reduced by modification of the original Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication into the so-called "floppy" Nissen fundoplication, a short and loose wrap of mobilized gastric fundus.	3.451036204209057
Failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon.	3.1484820829730675
Here, reoperation with refashioning of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication.	3.3379120826109054
Technical alternatives may selectively be chosen, when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated hiatal hernia, esophageal shortening, or serious esophageal motility disorders.	2.9491104154036116
Such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy, barium swallow, 24-h pH monitoring, and manometry.	3.0194386275974106
Alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs, including the Nissen fundoplication, Collis gastroplasty, and the Belsey Mark IV.	3.892041114329576
Modifications of the 360  ° Nissen operation are partial fundoplications like the Hill repair and the Toupet dorsal fundoplication.	2.911727399872379
Because of a high failure rate in the long-term follow-up, application of the ligamentum teres cardiopexy and of the Angelchik prosthesis is not recommended.	4.277115530297066
We report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) starting in a 5-year-old boy with gait disturbance.	3.023484426566056
At the age of 10 years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms: intention tremor, nystagmus and visual disturbance.	3.0446489937591883
The boy also had curly hair.	3.0865042905051983
Sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of microfilaments, which were also found in cytoplasma of Schwann cells, endothelial cells and fibrocytes.	3.3705061650688677
Similar changes were detected in endothelial cells of a muscle biopsy, which additionally displayed neurogenic atrophy and target fibers.	3.392071211770622
Immunohistochemically, desmin, vimentin, heat shock protein 70, and ubiquitin were not detectable in giant axons, which, however, contained neurofilament protein 68, 200 and  -tubulin.	3.387526367417771
Our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of GAN.	3.921039168292233
The endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way.	3.2269736397156614
Between 1 October 1994 and 7 May 1995, 46 patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on 55 hands were documented in a prospective study.	3.6575072514047586
The following results were taken from a questionnaire.	3.2083761997231637
There were not any complaints, or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in 51 of 55 cases.	3.327987659283733
There were continuing complaints in four cases, and after an additional check two patients were operated on again.	4.364094599060749
The advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative disablement.	3.216762637944653
For surgical removal of a malignant choroid melanoma, it is necessary to reduce systolic blood pressure to around 50-60 mmHg in order to prevent choroidal haemorrhages.	4.410350449796256
However, blood pressure reduction is associated with the risk of cerebral ischaemia.	5.042222446803003
We report a patient with a malignant choroid melanoma in whom waves I and II of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) disappeared during surgery under controlled arterial hypotension and hypothermia (31.1 ° C).	2.9357855930657344
The waves could be recorded again immediately after the mean arterial pressure was increased from 48 to 77 mmHg.	3.512419575443148
The oesophageal temperature had dropped by 0.3 ° C at this time.	3.111758325235772
The 2-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no irregularities during this time period.	2.9341865048812004
A bilateral, reversible, apparently blood-pressure-dependent loss of waves I and II during arterial hypotension despite a normal EEG has to our knowledge not been previously described in the literature.	3.1670499230941136
The isolated loss of waves I and II with maintenance of waves III, IV, and V is unusual.	3.125229555754663
The literature contains reports of acoustic neurinoma patients in whom only wave V could be recorded.	3.1767750764291303
This is regarded as an indication of continued impulse conduction despite the loss of waves I to IV.	3.6230754312223503
Others have observed a patient with temporary and reversible loss of BAEP wave I due to vasospasm of the internal auditory artery that apparently occurred during or shortly after manipulation of the internal auditory meatus.	3.31345720759292
Assuming anatomic peculiarities in the blood supply to the generators of the BAEP waves, a stenosis of the basilar artery could be considered as the cause of the bilateral reversible loss of waves I and II.	3.4134095736489214
Another potential source could be the induced hypothermia, but this does not seem very likely because the patient's temperature was 0.3 ° C lower at the return of the waves than at their loss.	3.3890023203314716
In the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy, little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias.	3.5428541079333833
In a group of 54 patients with documented ventricular tachycardia during longterm ECG recordings, the determinants for the development of VT and the relationship between signal-averaged ECG and the morphological characteristics of the disease are investigated.	3.9649163813898824
The analysis of the long-term electrocardiographic data includes the measurement of RR-intervals 30, 15, 5, 1min and immediately before onset of the VT, the determination of the morphology of the previous ventricular premature beats, and the frequency of the atrial arrhythmias.	4.2649000738781115
Normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ECG signal accquisition with bidirectional filters between 40 and 300Hz were defined a maximum of 113ms for a QRS width, LAS of 38ms, and RMS40 of 16uV.	3.300233887118355
The analysis of the long-term ECG produced monomorphic VT in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only 4 cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats.	3.4956854900788494
A long-short phenomenon could only be proven in 4VT episodes.	3.2433222601128646
In 84% of all tachycardias, no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event.	3.106582965044128
According to the circadian clock, two peaks, mornings between 6 and 9h and evenings between 6 and 9h, could be determined.	2.8011777788302217
In patients, who were recently diagnosed with ARVD, a significant shortening of the RR intervals before the onset of VT as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed.	3.8426747526167246
This effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of AVRD.	5.291333629885472
Late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74% overall.	3.78720898061794
Increasingly, late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the ARVD.	3.8522685707952102
A correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias (ventricular, sustained or not sustained VT) could not be established.	3.5430561928165925
In comparison to the origin of VT in coronary heart disease, previous arrhythmias play a less important role in arrhymogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy.	3.4504436673240653
Most importantly, an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of VT and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed.	3.4110298201518283
We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient with a Syme amputation of his left leg following diabetic gangrene of the foot.	2.6661017217193423
A  local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two  endoscopic debridements and lavage.	3.6379951155613943
This therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump.	3.6430712627382493
We describe an eighteen-months-old boy, who suffered from congenital vitium cordis, jejunalatresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphies and psychomotor retardation in connection with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.	2.822107774660912
In most cases the genesis of brachial plexus palsy is traumatic, often because of bike accidents.	2.8750163833379863
If physiotherapy and neurosurgical procedures such as nerve repair do not have the desired outcome, muscle transfer operations are possible.	3.4041333098975923
The results of our favored transfer of the trapezius muscle to compensate paralysis of the deltoid muscle will be presented.	3.1663730564907726
Preoperatively radiological, clinical and electromyographic examinations are necessary.	3.6594941092004736
Our results are based upon the clinical and radiological check ups and the subjective assessment of the patients.	4.388366796465995
Thirty-one patients (7 female, 24 male) underwent a trapezius transfer between March 1994 and December 1996.	3.119685254784522
The average age was 29 years (range 18-46 years).	3.0852167461262536
We performed the operations using a modification of Saha's technique.	3.1012974418853303
With the patient in lateral decubitus position and protection of the opposite plexus, a sagital skin incision is the first step, followed by the preparation of trapezius and deltoid muscle as well as the bony parts of the shoulder (acromion, clavicle, scapular spine).	3.847252448713358
The deltoid origin is cut from the lateral third of the clavicle, the acromion and the lateral half of the scapular spine.	3.567642045796103
The next step is transection of the root of the acromion and the lateral clavicle.	3.0193396215637773
After elevation of the remaining trapezius insertions from the clavicle and scapular spine, the proximal humerus is exposured by splitting the partly detached deltoid muscle longitudinally.	2.9966381753771496
Then the acromion fragment and humerus are prepared for the bone-to-bone contact.	3.854890239402692
In 90  ° of abduction the acromion fragment with its trapezius insertion is transferred and fixed to the humerus with two 4.5-mm screws.	2.9058107699442437
Finally the deltoid is sutured on the top of the trapezius and the skin is closed over two suction drains.	3.256728506088096
Postoperatively we immobilize the operated arm in an abduction support for 6 weeks.	3.2829696556663746
The physiotherapy program starts on the first postoperative day with active training of elbow, hand and fingers and electrostimulation of the transferred trapezius muscle.	2.926694227339404
Six weeks after the procedure we take an X-ray and start with progressive adduction of the arm.	3.395335774905751
The preoperative subluxation of the humeral head was abolished in all cases.	3.3031075267281476
We achieved an average increase of active abduction from 7.3  ° (range 0-45  °) preoperatively to 39.2  ° (range 25  °-80  °) 1 year after the operation; the increase of forward flexion was from 20  ° (range 0  °-85  °) to 43  ° (range 20  °-90  °).	3.4504858440226074
All patients were satisfied with the improvement of stability and function of the operated shoulder.	3.952389054889043
Finally we can conclude that the trapezius transfer for flail shoulder gives a satisfactory outcome regarding shoulder function and stability as well as the subjective situation of the patients.	3.6438062956970505
We analyzed psychiatric and criminological data from 103 arsonists.	2.9735460532034286
The following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to DSM-III-R and IDC-10 seem appropriate.	2.964995577361448
First, the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising, since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives quoted in DSM-III-R may also have an aggressive motive.	2.9403183928177903
Second, ICD-10 gives being drunk and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania.	3.164792392184669
This seems untenable, since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol misuse.	3.0076222698640063
Repeated firesetting, resulting from being fascinated by fire etc., may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a psychoinfantilism, which, supported by alcohol abuse, extends into older age.	3.3440606771013055
The mean age of such arsonists is slightly above 20 years.	3.072357530578063
The tendency for relapses after imprisonment seems to be low; this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age.	2.9614056699633706
The mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below 30 years, those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35, deluded arsonists have a mean age of 40 years.	3.1785160544763995
Concrete sexual motives are relatively rare.	3.4866119188975393
Approximately 50 % of arsonists have a purely aggressive motive.	3.234453785148599
Retaliation is a rare cause, however, since most of them do not even know the victims.	4.6258362652336515
One third of these persons set the fire in their own homes.	2.963210061582462
Most arsonists show a personality disorder, with insecurity and narcissism predominating.	3.1787498824575384
Data on firesetting are to be treated with caution, since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved; one fourth of cases concern minors, and in Central Europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists.	3.6720232049013672
A normal ciliary beat frequency of ciliated cells is necessary for the mucociliary clearance of the nose and paranasal sinuses.	3.0326836613026273
An in vitro investigation was performed to eval-uate the influence of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines on the ciliary beat frequency of human nasal mucosa.	3.4889614387906
The nasal sprays examined contained the corticosteroids budesonide or fluticasone propionate and the topical antihistamines azelastine or levocabastine.	2.663748983569306
All tests were performed on cell cultures of human nasal mucosa during constant conditions.	3.55548761967022
Three of the four nasal sprays tested contained benzalkonium chloride as preservative.	2.9310318460900926
An irreversible cessation of ciliary movement was observed in all cells exposed to nasal sprays containing benzalkonium chloride in a 50 per cent solution.	3.405973544110841
The nasal spray containing budesonide was benzalkonium chloride-free and caused minor but fully reversible decreases in ciliary beat frequency after 20 min.	2.9314012054378575
As benzalkonium chloride can cause complete standstill of ciliary beat frequency in vitro in human nasal mucosa, we recommend that this preservative should not be used anymore in topical nasal medications.	3.1988516972085383
The treatment of patients with severe burn injuries is expensive and belongs in the hands of specialized burn centres.	3.169849846435165
In our burn centre 257 patients were treated from 1991 to June 1995 (between 50 and 60 patients per year except for 1993 with 77 patients).	3.2299858165403608
Patients were evaluated according to the ABSI score (mean 7) and had mortality of around 15%.	3.5051827574955334
The costs range between 3.7 and 4.8 million DM per year, the profit lies in the same range.	3.582627218992894
The costs are divided into staff costs (1.4 - 1.8 million DM per year), costs for medical treatment (1.5 - 1.9 million DM per year) and costs for internal services (600 000 - 900 000 DM per year) such as laboratory examinations (247 000 - 386 000 DM per year) and blood bank (100 000 - 215 000 DM per year), the main factors in this category.	3.022757872342695
The different fields of costs and profit are compared in this analysis.	3.314199631867237
Possible ways of reducing costs are pointed out, and the question of effectiveness of therapy is discussed.	4.247807992034687
Conclusions from this analysis are limited by the individuality of each case with different clinical courses, the great number of influencing factors and the comparably small numbers of patients.	3.476384808217768
In benign laryngotracheal stenosis the amount of respiratory deterioration rather than the crude morphologic appearance will determine whether or not surgical measures such as dilatation or resection should be applied.	3.3415053935211074
This review focusses on currently available and newly developed diagnostic tools to assess the functional importance of central airway obstruction.	3.2137642646633187
After an outline of upper airway physiology is formulated, spirometric measurements at rest are collected.	2.982594637218684
A novel technique for fibrobronchoscopic assessment of glottic and tracheal resistance is presented in detail.	3.0379674418077616
In contrast to usual tests of total airflow resistance which cannot distinguish between central and peripheral contributions, this test identifies the pressure-flow-relationship created exclusively by the local lesion.	2.8284748792472065
In serial stenoses, it indicates which is of higher clinical impact.	3.2376010039489382
Patients with upper airway obstruction complain of impaired exercise capacity.	3.071675651810729
They tend to hypoventilate with imminent respiratory muscle fatigue.	3.1004263409817807
Therefore, spiroergometry may play a role in defining the point of incomplete compensation of a central load.	3.4360197305447553
The decision to operate will depend upon up the degree of physical capacity required to compensate for the stenosis.	3.29079216203145
Stroke units are hospital-based special wards aiming at optimal care by a specialized team with an integrated concept for patients with acute strokes.	3.799286509588777
Following the initial neurolo-gical and neuroradiological evaluation, early treatment will be initiated based on the assumed pathophysiology of the stroke.	3.2958293480957317
Acute management includes monitoring of physiological, parameters, care by specialized nurses, and early implementation of physiotherapists, speech therapy and occupational therapy.	3.0246351012790664
Despite the increased initial costs, the long-term burden for the health system is decreased by shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and disability.	3.718046888628014
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the most important side-effect of heparin therapy.	3.6761491974970077
Two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin: a frequent non-immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and, on the other hand, an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications.	2.9655125308070502
Patients and methods: We report on two cases with HIT type II after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).	3.2703340682426245
HIT antibodies were demonstrated by ELISA for platelet-factor-4-heparin-complex and heparin-induced platelet-activation (HIPA) assay.	3.3986071852511515
Results: A 67 year old patient suffered from a HIT type II seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization.	3.5287094523674085
The clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy.	3.433599957061929
Thromboembolic complications did not occur.	3.296799377254769
A 70 year old patient developed a HIT type II with thromboembolic complications 13 days after CABG.	3.7637867808528367
The vascular occlusions affected the A. spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior-syndrome, the coronary arteries with the development of myocadial infarction, and the A. iliaca interna.	4.382575912469297
A white-clot syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta, in the left atrium, and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation.	4.557522686903104
Conclusion: With therapy with heparin, it is obligatory to check platelet count.	3.7952414771378606
An indication for the development of HIT type II is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy.	4.000324328055082
Oxygen radicals and oxygen radial mediators are thought to be important components in the development of acute lung injury, sepsis, and multiple organ failure.	4.20095735438601
Injured patients, patients with pulmonary diseases, and multiple trauma patients also showed an elevated lipid peroxidation, indicating increased oxidant stress.	4.150424185288766
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been used as an antioxidant in a wide variety of experiments.	4.279014036306924
NAC has been suggested to act by raising concentrations of cysteine, and hence glutathione, and by scavenging of oxidant species [1, 11, 17, 29].	3.5789043192201975
The present study was designed to investigate whether the application of NAC in intubated patients has an effect on concentrations of reduced glutathione in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and on the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes.	3.0544407655096224
Because NAC has been widely used as a mucolytic drug for the treatment of lung diseases, the influence on tracheobronchial mucus was studied, too.	4.214902359133456
Between 1990 and 1995, 27 patients with posttraumatic disorders of the subtalar joint were treated by correcting fusion.	4.085756533006997
Preoperatively 24 patients (88.89 %) suffered from pain; 15 (55.56 %) had a walking range below 100 m. Seven patients were unable to work in their original profession.	3.181451202679541
After an average period of 13.85 months postoperatively the patients were examined again.	3.75634396479787
At this time 18 (66.67 %) had no or minimal pain; 19 (70.37 %) had no claudication.	2.9920160355047476
According to the score of Angus and Skuginna, in 81.48 % of patients the result of the correcting arthrodesis was successful; according to Kitaoka's clinical rating system for ankle-hindfoot, midfoot, hallux and lesser toes, the average postoperative score was 75.8 points.	3.059488855127308
Objective: To examine changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) in children in the last twenty years and to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity.	3.784013028088387
The review of medication has been recommended as an important part in preventing falls.	4.107592192883697
In a random sample of 276 hospital in-patients aged 75 and over, the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed.	3.4062056967970755
Questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire.	3.463791744126617
Migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding, whereas dystopia of lower jaw cuspids is described much more often in the literature.	3.5465810188264513
Neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth.	3.304789491845351
In atopic eczema patients the well-known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels (white dermographism, delayed blanch after acetylcholine, paradoxical blanching after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection) were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema-free state in comparison with controls.	3.1739669726079067
In this follow-up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema.	4.041328029499199
Severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema-free cutaneous state.	3.0232452039300592
We report on a 9-year-old girl with a giant cell fibroblastoma of the right anterior chest wall.	3.0986682047031247
This rare soft tissue tumour occurs predominantly in the first two decades of life.	3.9109535797623303
The typical clinical presentation is a solitary, usually 2-6 cm large, non-tender mass of blue-greyish colour which is mostly located on the back, anterior chest wall, thigh or groin.	3.48592041002833
The histology shows a loose infiltrate of predominantly bland spindle cells in dermis and subcutis.	2.7883773069503874
Characteristic elements of the tumour are large angiectoid branching spaces lacking any endo- or epithelium, and relatively small multinucleated cells (floret cells).	2.9992077131167783
The recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins.	3.1117646724264656
It is of pre-eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas, in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy.	3.5769652861603753
To correct severe septal deformities, it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage, followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft.	3.7138620922044074
The utilization of a compound graft, which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon (PDS) foil, facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum.	3.0515124826206685
Stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females.	3.761669364343457
The usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral.	3.457837806353985
Two competitive techniques - bladder neck suspension in accordance with Stamey and colposuspension in accordance with Burch - were retrospectively investigated.	3.3305774276664293
A total of 95 women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in 46 and 30 (total 76) patients respectively.	3.7355693105064054
However, the continence rate of the Stamey patients deteriorated after 6 weeks down to 78.3 % and after more than 2 years only 28.6 % of these patients were still completely continent (mean follow-up 40.4 mths), whereas deterioration in the Burch patients was only 87 % (mean follow-up 44.25 mths).	3.6096654558040977
The disappointing results with the Stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence.	3.5025610078126896
It was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression.	3.292779354678138
The three cases of recurring incontinence after Burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery.	3.669966495347555
With respect to long-term follow-up, our results with the Stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the Burch technique.	3.421967006177191
Therefore, in our opinion, the Burch colposuspension procedure and fascioplasty should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence.	4.062981715066619
This paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders, an issue being neglected in German psychiatry for a long time.	3.112070603130122
Social inequality will be discussed in it's dimensions "socioeconomic status" and "sex" referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge.	3.263571325437785
Because such macrosocial factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves microsocial concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level.	3.3112359749250753
These concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur.	3.7417096359034456
A short review of empirical findings and analytic approaches show the complexity of these mechanisms requiering further research not only because of analytic deficiences but also because of social change.	3.015602490561958
Further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases, in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure, and last but not least a gender-sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more differenciated.	3.2123565950303226
It is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation, although influences on the voice are not assumed.	3.0649843944265602
In addition to the vocal fundamental frequency, vibrations of the vocal chords generate overtones.	2.8798476771792996
Through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway, resonances and antiresonances are formed, and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent.	3.7735250893335763
Nozzle changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely.	3.640040257465807
The influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who owned two different dental prostheses.	3.6960019501153707
The fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture.	3.050622785492882
When the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement, a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture.	3.492118366890374
Sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position.	3.9100402900801634
This change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue, which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture.	4.000932723185886
In this situation, increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency, shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies.	3.138940587440197
These findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases.	2.8764436123796897
The etiology of this occurrence is still not clear.	3.1035436716482363
Its consequences, however, should be known to the dentist, ENT surgeon and phoniatrist if patients notice changes in their voice after having altered or replaced their dentures.	3.247801068112016
Cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure, as a function of severity of disease.	4.485118768841461
The source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research.	3.1030988303138183
Potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation, a neurohumoral dysbalance with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an overspill of cytoines from the failing heart itself.	2.6626809799327944
We present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system, particularly interleukin 6 release.	3.5106091017004086
Objectives: This 1998 survey was carried out on the use of the sitting position for neurosurgical procedures in the posterior fossa and operations of the craniospinal and cervical spine region by the dorsal approach.	3.655147734962889
In addition, anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the Neuroanesthesia Study Group of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) published in 1995 were investigated and compared to results of a 1995 survey.	3.377184274788432
Polar body analysis is a perfect tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation.	2.8183273789237178
This helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction, primarily in advanced maternal age patients.	2.9947411729639923
This might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients.	4.129063652555614
Polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal aberration or a mutation before they become pregnant.	2.8243467541443166
The paternal contribution to the embryo is left unattended.	3.2478370670749976
Ethical considerations do not play a role, since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos.	3.444914414923918
Pachydermoperiostosis (Friedreich-Erb-Arnold syndrome, Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome) is a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of unheritance; it occurs almost exclusively in men.	3.170626446823456
Associated features were clubbed digits of the hands and feet with watch-crystal nails, thickening of the skin and soft tissues, hyperhidrosis of hands and feet, hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands with seborrhoea, gynaecomastia, and ophthalmic abnormalities that had been present since puberty.	3.0229249033869796
Radiological examination revealed periosteal hyperostosis of the short and long bones.	3.434833387800429
Endocrine disturbances were not detected.	3.743937788379857
Skin biopsies showed hypertrophy of the skin and skin appendages.	3.8551933160557077
Primary (idiopathic, hereditary) pachydermoperiostosis should be distinguished from secondary (symptomatic) forms of the disease, which are often associated with lung tumours.	3.60525960354598
The following review will examine the outcome of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment studies of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.	3.100998649117097
For both eating disorders, psychotherapy is the treatment of choice.	3.3663157134785777
In clinical practice "treatment packages" are offered to account for the complexity of the disorders.	3.272784750364214
In bulimia nervosa, cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques have dominated the literature and appear to be successful.	3.440166382743259
Newer studies reporting on the use of interpersonal therapy also find considerable improvement of symptoms.	3.4349704191478265
Recently, a stepped care approach to treatment has been recommended, with self-care manuals as the first step.	3.640028056554851
In anorexia nervosa there is a paucity of controlled clinical trials.	3.4292319710513413
Contingency management for weight restoration can be viewed as a necessary element in all in- and outpatient treatments.	3.212747656535449
Family therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and psychodynamic approaches have proven useful in clinical practice; however, only a limited data base exists regarding the efficacy of these therapies.	3.613762442159365
Medication should not be used routinely in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.	4.540718955879192
Absorption of irrigating fluid in transurethral prostatic resection (TURP) and percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (PNL) into veins or delayed absorption due to fluid extravasation may result in a TURP syndrome.	2.8806497112176728
The measurement of end-tidal breath alcohol concentration (et AC) as a monitor of absorption of irrigating fluid labelled with 2% ethanol is limited by the disturbance of infrared sensors by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Fig.	2.9609228376615286
An electrochemical sensor is acceptable for this method.	3.289968663917675
The aim of the present study was the evaluation of breath alcohol measurements using an electrochemical sensor device (Alcomed 3010, Envitec).	2.689515125452755
The stability of the sensor in the presence of volatile anaesthetics was examined using a lung model.	3.829734272341615
In a clinical investigation, the device was then applied to spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients inhaling volatile anaesthetics during endoscopic urological surgery.	3.1239891596419196
Skin diseases, the psyche and psychological changes are often intertwined, especially in patients presenting for expert dermatologic opinion.	3.81373001854378
In many cases an additional evaluation provided by psychotherapeutic medicine may be necessary.	2.888345448814757
This resource may help with the diagnosis, explanation of the problem and estimation of the degree of disability.	4.672015656513506
The different legal guidelines of the various evaluation boards must be considered.	3.4014475216889175
The role of psychotherapeutic evaluation is demonstrated through case examples.	2.7933417757518186
The evaluation of new possibly occupationally-related disorders such as multiple chemical sensitivity and mobbing is considered.	3.005437246419038
We investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation.	2.8318881360470356
32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	3.292667563919472
The result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti-depressant effect of sleep deprivation.	2.56538294334413
During MRI-controlled resection of brain tumors using an open MRI system, operation-induced alterations may occur, especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall.	3.5097534265155304
This may simulate tumor areas, resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non-tumorous areas.	4.04114700966458
Based on 42 MRI- and biopsy-controlled brain tumor resections in an 0.5 T open MRI (Signa SP, GE), the appearance and origin of operation-induced reactions are analyzed.	3.180517307230843
In our opinion, there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation-induced microcontusions.	3.1920670090239094
The beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10-15 min.	3.4262159403981722
MRI-controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist allows discrimination of operation-induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation.	3.5298487451184504
Angiosarcomas are very rare but highly malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the vascular endothelium.	4.096620710848555
The tumor is most commonly found in the skin.	4.14394758512389
The therapy of choice is radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation.	3.001285188268527
Background: Lipoprotein (a) is an important codominantly inherited risk factor for coronary disease but there is little data about its distribution in childhood.	3.8372029013832325
Despite the important role of lymph node infiltration for the classification and prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), no standards exist to evaluate the quality of mediastinal lymphadenectomy.	4.1356399389510194
Researches at several centers are not convinced that complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is necessary.	3.1778264613167506
We investigated 270 consecutive patients undergoing a potential curative operation for NSCLC including complete ipsilateral lymph node dissection in order to ascertain whether or not there is a correlation between tumor localization and lymph node infiltration.	3.8970678088257507
Patients were classified into the UICC (1987) stages I (n = 115), II (n = 42), and IIIa (n = 113).	3.6040137807857433
In patients with N1-positive lymph nodes (n = 61) we found higher 5-year survival for patients with only intrapulmonary lymph node infiltration (39 %) than for patients with hilar infiltration (21 %).	3.771252727256815
Patients with N2 disease showed skip metastases in up to 81 % of cases.	3.304737369299363
We found that no tumor location predicted the lymph node infiltration.	3.2267981282875176
Due to the variability of lymph node infiltration and the frequently occurring skip metastases, complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy should be the standard for curative operations for NSCLC.	3.3728243801278195
The muscles should be viewed as a response member in functional and structural disorders as well as in central control.	3.708658793022318
This second part of the article will attempt to show not only that the muscles are representing an interesting and sensitive information pool for disorders in the motoric system, but also that lesions in specific leg and hip muscles have an effect on the pelvis and spine and even on scapular mobility.	3.359902425623728
Purpose: The aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease.	3.2054482358084524
Methods: From February 1996 to February 1998, 16 patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure (ABF) using the transperitoneal approach.	3.3968908524821133
Six, 5 to 12 mm ports were needed to dissect, cross-clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices.	2.8438427374870643
The aortic anastomosis was made end-to-side.	3.6925956574399508
A long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision.	3.263739184979914
The distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally.	3.2679544560873985
Results: The laparoscopic ABF was performed successfully in 13 of 16 cases.	3.4888393266570987
Three times a conversion to open surgery was requested.	3.4610804877904227
One patient developed respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment on the ICU.	3.0093015150318663
Mean operative time was 292 +/- 60 min; the aorta was crossclamped for 74 +/- 18 min.	3.2129629059846
Two patients needed transfusions of red blood cells.	3.015261821456681
In the study group, blood loss averaged 566 +/- 434 ml.	2.884446288997381
The bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography.	3.789811283774471
The patients were discharged 9 +/- 5.8 days after surgery.	3.4508972935859656
At follow-up after 4.5 +/- 4 months, 15 patients were examined noninvasively in the vascular laboratory.	4.0368566379704935
All grafts were patent, and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in 14 patients.	3.840512486103073
One patient with recurrent claudication had severe stenosis of the left distal anastomosis.	3.788348071755356
Conclusions: The laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible, safe and effective procedure.	2.9666933931373434
Specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure.	3.4859828964815156
The development of vascular staplers and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge.	2.9558705253923367
In the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease.	2.9145184959133026
A 12 year old boy developed the complete symptom complex of Adamantiades-Behçet's disease over a two-year period.	3.3317206103863426
He presented with the mucocutaneous variant with recurrent to persistent oral ulcers which extended into the pharynx, recurrent genital ulcers, perianal lesions, and a positive pathergy test.	3.5222319169700125
Ocular involvement and other  symptoms associated with the disease were absent.	4.249948928559421
The patients father deficiency of suffered from bronchial asthma with recurrent respiratory infections.	2.831860344639782
An IgG-3 subclass was detected.	3.21185162709567
Lymphocyte transformation tests showed markedly diminished response to stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in both patients, while response to PWM, CoA and PHA was normal.	3.038882031544891
In addition, the concentration of serum soluble interleukin 6 receptor was reduced in both patients.	3.096972068902042
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of dermatophytes was established.	2.9985994629104313
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" amplify a 581 bp fragment within the gene coding for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.	2.6597214235957156
PCR allowed the detection of isolates of 7 common dermatophytes and in addition several yeasts and moulds.	3.451392955321745
Hybridisation with specific oligonucleotides results in the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.	4.016746477107703
Restriction analysis of the PCR product allowed us to distinguish between dermatophytes and yeasts or moulds.	3.941874085054139
The specifity of the PCR with respect to fungi was assessed by testing human DNA collected from 42 dermis and epidermis specimens as well as DNA from selected plants and animals.	3.94011830303117
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the PCR assay, 69 routinely collected skin and nail specimens were examined by PCR and culture.	3.254640410089096
PCR detected dermatophytes in 35 and culture in 28 of 38 specimens that were classified as positive.	3.55148738678509
Sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).	3.508076449390671
Starting with the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", a current empirical stock-taking was undertaken about the structure of care in psychiatric hospital units.	3.063990801084922
319 treatment units (289 in Germany, 11 in Austria, and 19 in Switzerland) were investigated concerning size of the treatment unit, number of wards, centrality of admission, existence of large observation rooms ("Wachsäle"), spezialized wards, single sex wards, regionalization/sectorization, open-door wards, coercive measures, and intended structural changes.	3.156507933649797
The return rate of questionnaires amounted 59%.	2.976754427230475
The results show that the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête" are mostly realized today, but not everywhere.	3.1555565518220314
Across countries differences resulted in size of ward, centrality of admission, open-door wards, and coercive measures.	2.716776992720932
Treatment units in the western and eastern parts of germany differed in size of ward and centrality of admission.	2.9221182980119074
Differences between psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric departments at general hospitals and psychiatric university hospitals were, though significant, smaller than expected in the light of past controversies.	3.240610572077221
Intended structural changes mainly concerned open-door wards, internal sectorization, decentralization of admission, and mixing the sexes in single sex wards.	2.890011246042613
Background: The ciliary sulcus as the intended location of transsclerally fixated posterior chamber lenses (PCL) is withdrawn from the surgeon's view.	2.6116146315770883
Using high-resolution ultrasound, we acquire pictures that postoperatively allow us to determine the position of the haptics.	3.5007666738254533
Many patients would like to resume some sport activities after total knee replacement; however, most recommendations are based on subjective opinion rather than scientific evidence.	2.9745864919560985
Background: Considering the high recurrence rate after conventional inguinal hernia repair, the totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been used.	3.3210790867571642
Methods: The present experience of the authors embraces 1085 patients with a total of 1717 inguinal hernias, including 200 recurrences.	3.7611527880919855
The operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and tricks.	3.269700751621462
Results: Analysis of the data concerning the first 403 patients with 1 year complete follow-up reveals a mean (SEM) operating time of 42 (1.2) min for unilateral and 58 (1.0) min for bilateral hernia repair.	3.6813137131043483
Mean (SEM) postoperative hospital stay was 2 (0.04) days.	3.2686267553816553
Complication rates during and after operation were 0.3 % and 3.3 % respectively.	3.7033524944242195
The morbidity rate at 1 month after operation was 3.5 %.	3.711022993304949
The recurrence rate was 0.3 % at 1-year follow-up.	3.6159454726908127
Conclusion: Totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is safe and reproducible for any type of primary or recurrent inguinal hernia, even in patients with previous subumbilical surgery or severe systemic disease.	3.783285504751557
Careful follow-up is mandatory to assess the late recurrence rate.	4.3482147961469515
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively whether there are differences in spectrometrically measurable parameters of the fundus between patients with early and late age-related maculopathy (ARM), the children of the ARM patients (F1 generation) and normals.	3.3489236451751503
In approximately 4-10 % of patients presenting with renal cell cancer the transluminal propagation of a tumor thrombus into the vena cava inferior or the right atrium comes to diagnosis.	3.4985660135735386
Recent investigations have indicated that the presence of neoplastic extension into the venous system does not reveal independent prognostic value regarding the clinical course of the disease.	3.452188449294152
Although the complete surgical removal of vena cava thrombosis in patients without simultaneously occurring regional lymph node or distant metastases has become a well established treatment modality, several questions concerning this surgical strategy still remain the subject of ongoing discussions.	3.4765287515902203
In the present investigation that included 92 patients with renal cell cancer and intracaval neoplastic extension it was clearly demonstrated that the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest preferably during the removal of intracaval thrombosis extending into the right atrium does not result in a substantially increased treatment-related intra- or postoperative mortality.	3.5562124705772904
However, in contrast to a previously reported observation this treatment option did not reveal any substantial impact on the long-term survival of the patients following surgical therapy.	4.08379450646829
Accordingly, the cranial extension of intracaval thrombosis was not identified as a biological variable of any prognostic importance for renal cell cancer patients.	3.2253577391878805
Vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction.	3.414169285106826
In this category, penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients: males younger than 50 years of age at time of surgery, maximum of two risk factors, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.	3.7087864797478747
Long-term success decreased to 53 % to 55 % in comparison to first encouraging reports of 80 % success.	3.357225910509921
Venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the elapse of time after surgery.	3.210482884540387
Long-term success dropped under 40 %, leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation.	3.1626966323704253
In contrast, penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates.	2.9442821738375193
Despite this, it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the cavernosal bodies.	3.7177636442474817
Among numerous types of penile implants, preference is nowadays mostly given to the three-piece hydraulic models.	3.2718214212867376
However, such complications as defective or perforated cylinders in up to 35 % after 5 years have arisen, depending on the type of implant.	3.4579609253360335
In a selected patient group, vacuum constriction devices with a mean patient acceptance of 75 % (50 % to 90 %) seldom result in complications and are thus considered to be a well-established therapeutical option.	3.154130912765232
It has been suggested that anhedonia, the loss of pleasure, is associated with a dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	2.891215097648827
In a series of neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies, we examined pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission in non-human primates and in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	3.127595474037849
Among alcoholics, we found indicators of a sensitization of dopaminergic neurotransmission, which was associated with the relapse risk, but not with anhedonia or depression.	4.213631601101054
Schizophrenics with neuroleptic blockade of striatal dopamine D2 receptors displayed psychomotor slowing and reduced motivation, but not anhedonia.	3.3891830909511294
Primate studies pointed to the importance of a temporo-cortical dysfunction in the pathogenesis of phasic dopaminergic dysregulation in the striatum.	3.5404506490599714
These observations indicate that a dysfunction of stimulus-dependent dopamine release may be associated with motivational deficits caused by a reduction in incentive salience, but not with anhedonia.	3.7422218657939714
Any operation for lung cancer that is planned as curative includes dissection of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum in order to allow correct staging of the disease.	3.603502055341956
It is well known that ipsilateral lymph node metastases (N2) mean a poor prognosis.	2.884341731351479
Therefore, the probability of a therapeutic effect from more radical removal of lymph nodes in the mediastinum is rather low.	3.256945327462471
On the other hand, it is justified to apply and evaluate additional systemic treatment in these tumor stages.	3.251792018655887
In analogy with high-dose contrast-enhanced CT, there have been a few studies during recent years that have dealt with high-dose paramagnetic contrast dyes in MRI.	3.8112562244872383
One reason for these studies was the development of new and low-osmolar contrast agents in the MR field.	3.865578562799323
Depending on the clinical problem, a high-dose contrast study in MRI is rarely indicated: (1) in metastatic disease, MR imaging with high-dose contrast material is indicated when the standard dose study is negative or only shows a solitary cerebral lesion or a number of lesions just suitable for radiosurgery; (2) in patients with malignant glioma the high-dose study allows better definition of the tumor margins.	4.311889062282632
(3) in patients with MS, a high-dose study is only recommended within therapeutic trials in which the number of active plaques is a primary variable.	4.844297834211168
The basic idea of the Collaborative Family Health Care is nothing new.	2.732043224217783
It has its roots in the bio-psycho-social model of medicine developed by George Engel in the U.S.A. and it has a long tradition in the German psychosomatic medicine.	3.064432454686087
At a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note, that Collaborative Family Health Care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action-orientation.	2.827077317296004
The basic is a systemic view of illness and health.	3.120423109905093
The doctor-patient-dyad is in this view enlarged to a treatment-triad composed of the therapist, the patient and his family, to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal, i.e.	3.283486893374559
the treatment motivation of the patient, the support of the family and the expertize of the therapist.	4.392160910657563
A lot of studies support the resource- saving potential of coopertive methods.	2.944789230299768
However, their realization is not possible without considerable learning processes of physicians, psychotherapists and other  professionals.	3.251892688704195
A potential has to be mobilized, which affects by no means only the costs.	3.4720605977271792
The Collaborative Family Health Care offers new challenges to the professional culture of psychotherapists and new chances for influencing the world of medical health care.	3.016396023398957
At a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity, the iniitiatives of CFHC offer a possibility for physicians, patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation.	3.0212457970864017
Interested colleagues are invited to collaborate in the German Section of the CFHC.	3.5368707343998347
We evaluated the short- to mid-term results of an unconstrained total ankle prosthesis (S. T. A. R.) with uncemented fixation.	3.3667552693847154
Fifty consecutive ankle replacements were performed in 48 patients between 1996 and 1999.	3.6378316301784857
The initial diagnosis was posttraumatic osteoarthrosis in 31 cases (62 %), primary osteoarthrosis in 8 cases (16 %), and systemic joint affection in 11 cases (22 %), e. g. rheumatoid arthritis (6 cases), hemochromatosis (2 cases), psoriasis arthritis (1 case), lupus erythematodes (1 case), and sclerodermia (1 case).	3.6793149558088194
There were two perioperative complications: one superficial wound dehiscence that healed uneventfully, and one injury to the dorsal foot artery that necessitated primary reconstruction.	3.0093814861191652
Seven revisions, all in cases of posttraumatic arthrosis, were necessary: local revision of the fibula for painful lateral impingement (3 cases), posteromedial soft tissue revision for painful restriction of dorsiflexion (2 cases), percutaneous lengthening of the Achilles tendon (1 case), and osteotomy and callus distraction for angular correction after stress fracture of the distal tibia (1 case).	3.4753179609687783
At the last follow-up control, 21 patients (62 %) were very satisfied, 10 patients (29 %) were satisfied, and 3 patients (9 %) were satisfied with reservations.	4.553145295385814
The obtained range of motion was 30  ° (range, 15 to 55  °), with a maximal plantarflexion of 25  ° (range, 15 to 45  °) and dorsiflexion of 5  ° (-3 to 20  °).	3.7040035111763197
When the AOFAS-Hindfoot-Score was applied, the 34 patients scored 84.1 points (range, 44 to 100 points).	3.0300158106593575
After settling of the implants within 6 weeks, no migration was noted in any case, and all implants were considered to be stable.	4.52786054512516
The favorable results were considered to be a result of the mechanical properties of the S. T. A. R. total ankle prosthesis that allows for unconstrained motion of the polyethylene inlay on the tibial component, e. g. anteroposterior translation, mediolateral translation and axial rotation.	3.33743745580084
The success of implantation may depend on exact technique, correct hindfoot alignement, sufficient capsuloligamentous stability of the ankle, and a solid bone stock.	3.6068305081654235
Although our first results are very encouraging, a longer follow-up is mandatory to answer the question whether ankle replacement is a viable alternative to ankle arthrodesis.	3.208083202138938
In a prospective study, the influence of the status of the peri-implant hard and soft tissues on the success of enosseous dental implants in tumor patients was assessed.	3.4437171634441186
Out of 59 tumor patients with 261 implants, treated between July 1988 and August 1996, a pool of 23 patients with 99 implants provided with dentures for at least 1 year was obtained.	3.100528933628771
Eighteen of these patients suffered from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.	4.285000242867337
Seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiation (40 Gy).	3.0053983525776014
A total of 68 out of 99 implants were inserted into autologous bone transplanted to reconstruct the mandible.	3.1041645364915924
In order to assess the peri-implant hard and soft tissues, the Hygiene Index, the Sulcus Bleeding Index, the Gingiva Index, the pocket-probing depth, the peri-implant bone resorption, and the periotest were used.	3.010561158673108
The results in the tumor patients were compared with the results in a pool of nontumor patients.	5.1360912358422635
Tumor patients had significantly worse peri-implant parameters than nontumor patients.	3.003397299844021
The peri-implant pocket-probing depth proved to have significant influence on the success rate.	3.648221060593636
The overall success rate was 77.8%.	2.719564921013208
Many articles in the literature document the fact that postoperative pain therapy has not improved for decades despite new insights into pain physiology, the availability of powerful analgesics and the development of new techniques.	4.088520612455369
This project was set up to develop practical, effective, safe, and easy to run acute pain therapy.	3.204003636640621
A 26-year-old man sustained a C2 arc fracture.	3.469380469964868
Ventral spondylodesis using an H-plate was performed.	3.4221880445252553
The patient developed a pharyngovertebral fistula which remained undetected for 1 year.	2.9022805904581634
Spontaneous fusion of C3/C4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred.	2.9210253364154464
The fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was transorally removed.	3.6225915986128694
No further problems occurred after this unusual method of treatment.	3.4013379205707484
The anatomy of the cervical spine, special problems of intensive care patients and the use of proper instrumentation are discussed.	4.875275611614089
An interscalene block of the brachial plexus was combined with general anaesthesia for repair of a complex chronic lesion of the shoulder.	4.286183024054022
The localisation of the plexus with electro-stimulation and the injection of Bupivacain 0.5% were accomplished easily and without painful sensations.	3.1780878767540703
48 hours later the block was still partially present.	3.50444246044184
Paraesthesia and a sensory and motor innervation deficit affected mainly the dorsal fascicle, but also areas innervated by the median and lateral fascicles.	3.347600221613943
The deficit did not completely disappear for 18 month.	3.1270820574466387
The cause could have been due to direct traumatisation during blockade or operation, toxic action of the injected substance (Bupivacain 0,5%, 30 ml), distension of the plexus, a cervical syndrome or an aseptic plexitis, although a definite determination is not possible.	3.4273390485808823
However, the pattern of the lesion and the lack of pain during localisation of the plexus and injection favour traumatisation during the acromioplasty.	3.5386535287959635
Microfilm photography allows documentation of naevi in a map-like fashion.	3.149946790076937
The localization of multiple naevi is no longer a problem, as one can scan the film.	3.4416718121708847
Magnification up to 48 times is possible.	3.5090965471006976
Detection of early changes of the naevi, during the horizontal growth phase, should increase the 5-year survival rate.	3.5109193485772745
In the ancient times, Aristotle, Herophilos, and Galen discovered basic anatomical structures.	2.7551215282134045
Paul von Aegina, in the seventh century a. c., had the idea of a nerve suture, which was first performed in an animal 1000 years later by the Italian surgeon Gabriele Ferrara.	3.719230347387766
Systematic investigations on nerve crossing date to the beginning of the nineteenth century and were conducted by Jean Pierre Flourens.	3.038852883250148
Within 1 week in summer 1864, two French surgeons (Laugier and Nélaton) independently carried out the first nerve sutures in humans.	2.6999959237085163
Their observations of an immediate functional recovery of the appropriate muscles after suturing were discussed controversially in scientific circles.	3.2352447750440354
Purpose: To analyze the value of electrophysiologic testing according to standards of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) in infants less than 10 years of age.	3.1792012594709913
The entity was first described in 1983.	3.502800651942569
The tumor is regarded as low-grade sarcoma by some authors; its cause and pathogenesis are presently unknown.	3.4424812909357514
This is a case report on a 27-year-old man who underwent 4 surgical procedures of the left lower extremity because of a recurrent soft tissue neoplasm, initially (August 1993) diagnosed as a myxolipoma.	3.6917636374599874
The patient suffered from recurrences in February 1995, September 1996 and February 1998.	3.062675636072344
The diagnosis was revised at the time of the latest recurrence.	3.2972011011017752
A palliative resection with macroscopic residuals left was performed in February 1998, followed by a radiation therapy with 56 Gy total dose and a concomitant administration of the radiosensitizer razoxane per os.	3.6673482702994598
The single radiation doses were 200 cGy 5 times a week.	2.987099958141339
The small residuals of the tumor obviously regressed although an objective response could not be shown because the lesion was not clearly measurable.	3.74115974109726
A follow-up 2 years after the radiation treatment revealed no recurrence.	4.138599304223722
The time of the local control achieved as yet is already longer than any former time to regrowth between the surgical procedures.	3.5364649853215537
This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a therapeutic irradiation of a recurrent aggressive angiomyxoma.	3.839896551284792
Radiation therapy combined with the sensitizer razoxane is able to control a recurrent AAM for an unknown time.	3.4848492096193966
It remains open whether a radiation treatment alone would have had a similar effect.	3.226580902734814
Surgical procedures of external and internal neurolyses, nerve coaptation and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized.	3.075166941207598
With microneurosurgery of motor nerves, satisfying or good results can be generally obtained.	3.2197218213009267
Success rates exceeding 50% following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures, more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient.	3.664039856598624
Perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts, e.g., by development of minimally invasive, eventually endoscopically guided procedures.	3.1812073191821755
Allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied.	4.488232080591979
Initial experiments with nerve distractions are encouraging.	3.3063902241875995
Objective: The acceptance of fibromyalgia as a disease entity and its definitive diagnosis have been hampered by a dearth of knowledge concerning the underlying pathophysiology of this disease and the lack of specific biochemical markers applicable to its diagnosis.	3.409129063514737
To determine whether abnormal collagen metabolism is a characteristic of fibromyalgia, we have analyzed collagen metabolites in the urine and serum of patients with fibromyalgia.	4.048809220917687
Methods: The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria.	3.524784263177712
Urine and serum were collected under standardized conditions from 39 patients and 55 age- and sex-matched controls.	3.1446160351552375
Pyridinoline (Pyd) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpyd), which represent products of lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linking in collagen and are indicators of connective tissue and bone degradation, respectively, were analyzed by ion-paired and gradient HPLC method with fluorescence detection (HPLC).	3.186690169931525
Levels of hydroxypyroline (Hyp), a collagen turnover marker, were also measured.	3.4666487271102406
The findings were related to creatinine levels and the Pyd/Dpyd ratio determined.	3.159543996522711
The Pyd/Dpyd ratios in the urine and serum and the Hyp in the urine were significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls.	3.6830262402650655
Conclusion: Decreased levels of collagen cross-linking may contribute to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and collagen deposition around the nerve fibers in fibromyalgia and contribute to the lower pain threshold at the tender points.	3.1963418448420375
Analysis of altered collagen metabolism either by histologic examination on biopsy or, preferably, by HPLC analysis of collagen metabolites in urine or serum may aid to understand more about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia.	3.178651295045272
Background: The dynamic radionuclide nephrography (Tc99m-MAG3) is an important method in the evaluation of obstruction of the upper urinary tract.	3.9924592044103098
The aim of the present study was to assess whether radionuclid nephrography under standardized conditions with adequate hydration and Furosemid induced diuresis can reliably detect a significant obstruction at the pelvi-ureteric junction.	2.5410657925456723
We therefore tested whether minimal tracer washout (10-25%) in the presence of normal renal function could justity a non-operative managment.	4.362437164595709
The lateral decubitus position is the standard position for nephrectomies.	3.815597889496743
There is a lack of data about the effects of this extreme position upon respiratory mechanics and gas exchange.	3.0618003189597
In 20 patients undergoing surgery in the nephrectomy position, we compared a new closed-loop-controlled ventilation algorithm, adaptive lung ventilation (ALV), which adapts the breathing pattern automatically, to the respiratory mechanics with conventionally controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV).	3.804050688542378
The aims of our study were (1) to describe positioning effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, (2) to compary ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller with traditional settings of CMV, and (3) to assess the individual adaptation of the ventilatory parameters by the ALV controller.	3.4673908391841683
The respirator used was a modified Amadeus ventilator, which is controlled by an external computer and possesses an integrated lung function analyzer.	3.563666614514233
In a first set of measurements, we compared parameters of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in the horizontal supine position and 20 min after changing to the nephrectomy position.	3.3358564558931856
In a second set of measurements, patients were ventilated with ALV and CMV using a randomized crossover design.	2.999091586611
The CMV settings were a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg body weight, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min, an I:E ratio of 1:1.5, and an end-inspiratory pause of 30% of inspiratory time.	3.6292559714057324
With both ventilation modes FiO2 was set to 0.5 and PEEP to 3 cm H2O.	3.1604602507822284
During ALV a desired alveolar ventilation of 70 ml/kg KG - min was preset.	3.2890090258294418
All other ventilatory parameters were determined by the ALV controller according to the instantaneously measured respiratory parameters.	3.991527102049182
Positioning induced a reduction of compliance from 61.6 to 47.9 ml/cm H2O; the respiratory time constant shortened from 1.2 to 1.08 s, whereas physiological dead space increased from 158.9 to 207.5 ml.	2.88337467978304
On average, the ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller resembled very closely those used with CMV.	2.7536776541401395
However, an adaptation to individual respiratory mechanics was clearly evident with ALV.	2.875517237864998
In conclusion, we found that the effects of positioning for nephrectomy are minor and may give rise to problems only in patients with restrictive lung disease.	4.138514581521928
The novel ALV controller automatically selects ventilatory parameters that are clinically sound and are better adapted to the respiratory mechanics of ventilated patients than the standardized settings of CMV are.	3.0353086835601037
Noma is an ulcerative-necrotizing gingivo-stomatitis eventually leading to severe destruction of the midface, including lips and cheek, maxilla/mandible, nose and rarely the orbit.	2.8554442938886573
The defects are usually unilateral.	3.4362488755753766
Children from economically underdeveloped countries are predominantly affected.	3.087620573228776
Medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate, which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time.	3.886151038100208
Predisposing factors include malnourishment, immunosuppression, and poor oral hygiene.	3.2151810014706537
Forty-eight noma patients were surgically treated in Sokoto, Nigeria during October 1997 by an Interplast Germany team sponsored by AWD Stiftung Kinderhilfe.	2.623966247113331
Interdisciplinary surgical strategies and results, e. g. ankylosis release, local flap coverage and 12 pedicled musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi island flaps, as well as a noma classification (NOMAC), are presented.	3.321665933345246
During a period of 3 years, four controled clinical studies in 34 patients with hypercholesterolaemia and 40 healthy persons - in some cases with stratification of the basic cholesterol levels and matched pair formation - were performed to find out the effects of serial sun-like UV irradiation on various serum parameters and blood circulation functions.	3.4959392573464516
The following significant effects were observed.	3.1485318656149848
Patients with hypercholesterolaemia: increase of HDL cholesterol after termination of the serial UV irradiation, increase of serum 25 (OH)D3 levels, decrease of serum triiodothyronine, decrease of serum lactate; healthy persons: decrease of resting pulse rate, decrease of recovery pulse rate, decrease of systolic blood pressure.	2.7813028322584756
All effects were induced by application of suberythematous UV doses, i.e.	3.0209828324774386
amounts of UV with a relatively low risk of side effects.	3.848678191369063
In 1998 Minor et al.	2.786278132251988
described a new variant of perilymphatic fistula: the "superior canal dehiscence syndrome".	3.1523405261652284
This syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure.	2.8457804391055705
Due to this dehiscence, a third, mobile window (in addition to the round and oval windows) is formed, and changes in pressure are pathologically transduced to the anterior semicircular canal.	3.157817020649728
In the present study we evaluated proprioceptive capabilities of the knee joint with a balance test and correlated these findings to parameters which document mechanical stability.	2.9100049698926913
We compared 8 conservatively treated and 12 surgically treated patients with ACL-deficient knee joints with a control group of 12 subjects.	3.677375657602138
The balance test was performed with a Kistler force plate.	3.6551574870071164
Both the conservatively treated and the surgically treated patients showed significantly higher deviations of their centre of gravity than the control group.	3.2335679989439834
This was true not only for the injured leg but also for the noninjured contralateral leg.	3.4504087543839326
The differences were most remarkable when comparing the entire distance of centre of gravity deviations during 10 s. Additionally, the conservatively treated patients interrupted the test procedure significantly more frequently than the other two groups.	3.1033473066760195
We were not able to document any correlation between proprioceptive function and parameters for joint stability such as anterior drawer, Lachman, pivot shift and KT-1000 measurements.	2.575699377993518
The study examined the validity of psychometric measures for the assessment of driving ability in brain-damaged subjects.	3.5238229725270562
Only 58% of the patients passed the driving test.	4.229789365167438
Attempts to predict the outcome of the driving test by discriminant analysis or cut-off procedures based on neuropsychological and/or other subject-related data yielded a maximum of 73% correct predictions.	3.7188302971453586
In view of the frequent impairment in driving ability after brain damage and in view of the failure to reliably predict driving ability from psychometric test results, it is recommended that in each case an on-road driving test is given.	3.329634676983624
Intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes.	4.082067329330798
The aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ENT-related laser surgery.	2.6404057641702012
In a prospective study, 91 patients were included and the Mallampati-score modified by Samsoon and Young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation.	3.235481790492489
The results showed a significant correlation (p <0.05, Chi-Square test).	3.3356715525801905
However, the specificity was only 72% and the sensitivity of 60% was too low to be of practical use.	3.0228881316961647
The results were independent of the endotracheal tube used.	3.7150264243389626
Although use of the laser for ENT operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist, there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use.	3.810599849403674
This problem is demonstrated in a literature  review.	3.4815089706004376
The treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge.	3.6412140150560424
We report on a 12 year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to NHL-BFM 95: Block AA protocol.	3.115794207445837
During his therapy, he developed a thrombosis of his right femoral vein and pulmonary embolism affecting the left segments 4, 5, 8, and 9.	3.8679326685929554
Because of cerebral metastasis a fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicated.	2.9894567803209275
Therefore, we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the Amplatz thrombectomy device.	3.090851417622406
The postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion; dopplersonography 4 months postinterventionally showed a patent right femoral vein.	2.9588971536637994
Within this chapter, tumors which produce bone matrix (osteoid) or other bone-forming tissues, like cartilage, connective tissue, and cementum or originate within the bone marrow are described.	2.9111023007585968
In addition, those lesions are mentioned which, according to the WHO, are typical for the jawbones and are therefore included within the 1992 WHO classification of odontogenic tumors.	3.256358794130254
Vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described.	4.112742197786261
All the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance.	3.489071092975847
A precise diagnosis, therefore, can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field.	3.7891933087876963
In addition to clinical, radiological, and histological appearances, therapeutic necessities are described.	3.0501804274797624
The data from recent publications are taken into account.	3.0968906596533863
This presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the German-Austrian-Swiss Study Group of Tumors of the Face and Jaws (DÖSAK) in Basel.	3.378772431130011
Between 1987 and 1996 302 patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases.	3.775399403498044
Forty-five patients (18 %) of this population were 70 years or older at time of admission.	3.969075554017106
In this population 17 major resections and 8 minor liver resections were performed.	3.0883638204451835
In 9 patients irresectable metastases were diagnosed during treatment of the primary tumor.	3.490381106938379
In 3 cases laparotomy had to be finished as exploration.	3.4184789740705273
Eight patients were treated without surgery.	4.091735659048106
Mortality after liver resection was 4 %, morbidity 28 %.	3.7625532222168907
The 5-year-survival-rate (Kaplan-Meier) of the R0 resected patients (n = 21) was 44 %.	3.67618911264885
Comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease.	4.184995263724715
Survival, morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences.	4.39645198735891
These results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed efficently and with a curative intention.	3.8356370896220064
The clinical course of 12 patients with mushroom poisoning was evaluated in order to define the parameters considered to be relevant to the indication for liver transplantation.	4.289522768858137
Eight patients recovered under conservative therapy; one patient died due to pre-existing, concomitant cardiopulmonary disease.	3.3707118790253485
In three patients transplantations had to be performed because of severe liver failure.	3.7844339369122117
On admission, the transplanted patients had a decreased Quick's test score and factor V value (< 10 %).	2.9823588113281834
The peak of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, partial thromboplastin time and azotemia were not of any prognostic value.	3.0472050453099446
Main indications for liver transplantation were a very low initial Quick's test score and factor V value (both < 10 %) and their inadequate response under substitution therapy.	3.0131740329791548
The development of encephalopathy and renal failure were further parameters indicating poor prognosis.	2.749995837001101
During submaximal isotonic back extension loading (31 male persons) surface-EMG was measured using 16 monopolar-linked electrodes in the low back region (L 3-S 1).	3.041765268801056
By means of modification of amplitude- and frequency parameters in the EMG-signal two subject groups (6 persons each) with the slightest and most severe muscle fatigue in the paraspinal region were defined.	2.8949949074550094
For the analysis of muscle coordination, the EMG signal on the basis of an amplitude estimate at the beginning and at the end of the load situation was compared.	4.061579517127424
During the extension phase, the group with slight fatigability showed no different spatial pattern of myoelectrical activity at the end of investigation than at the beginning.	3.4739816266322467
In contrast to this, the pattern of myoelectrical activity changed during the endurance test in the group of persons with considerable fatigability.	3.5815581608832736
Therefore, in addition to the muscular fatigue also the loss of muscle coordination has to be taken into account in the assessment of spinal function.	3.6282174089203725
Background: A fractional flow reserve (FFRmyo) <0.75 is a well validated parameter for significance of coronary stenoses in cases of normal myocardial function.	3.5257042592226506
We used the FFRmyo limit in patients with impaired myocardial perfusion by myocardial infarction and/or hypertension for intermediate stenoses of the LAD for decision to PTCA and checked the indication by clinical follow-up.	3.623123852019066
Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia.	3.992950162172405
Usually, a non-continuous distraction mode is applied.	3.7904286816690123
The aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder.	2.5897861044581134
Using a submandibular approach, the mandible was dissected subperiostally on one side in four mini-pigs; corticotomy was performed and the microhydraulic cylinder fixed with two bicortical screws.	3.039666717575314
The hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic hydropneumatic injector system.	3.0894348321514746
Following 7 days at rest, a continuous distraction of 1.5 mm per day was performed for 14 days.	3.629557246228883
The mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed.	3.4372290381123274
The microhydraulic cylinder was easy to apply and to handle.	3.351480853877733
The continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles.	2.716025527459167
Bony regeneration seems to be accelerated, which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase.	3.881698460331955
When tetracaine is used, the addition of epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration.	3.437611739495425
For bupivacaine, however, the influence of epinephrine on the duration is not clear.	4.6236056040947275
We investigated the effects of epinephrine 1: 200 000 added to bupivacaine 0.5% on duration and haemodynamics.	3.0917409552563586
Ten former pre-term infants with postnatal respiratory problems, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair, were enrolled in the study after informed parental consent had been obtained.	3.429138945115618
The infants were fasted at least 4 h prior to surgery.	2.996364307212519
If they did not receive i.v.	3.07293553492611
infusions before surgery, a bolus of 10 ml/kg Ringer's acetate was injected after inserting the i.v.	3.093265012848324
Spinal anaesthesia was performed in a sitting position with 0.6 ml bupivacaine 0.5%.	3.715525131235534
Five patients received plain bupivacaine (group I) and five bupivacaine with epinephrine 1: 200 000 (group II).	3.375349138693774
Heart rate registered by ECG and non-invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to positioning the baby for lumbar puncture and 2, 5, 10, and 20 min after injection of bupivacaine.	3.6839819614458924
The duration of spinal anaesthesia was defined as the time from injection to the time when the first movements of the legs were observed after stimulation.	4.037593427233772
Results (expressed as median and range).	3.073251499734964
Additional epinephrine significantly prolonged the duration of spinal anaesthesia (group II: 95 min [60 - 120] vs group I: 50 min [37 - 85]).	3.445249481603864
Haemodynamic parameters did not differ at any time between or within the groups.	3.6590541690354774
In group I, one infant had high spinal anaesthesia with impaired respiration but without cardiovascular effects; after 10 min of assisted ventilation by mask, sufficient respiration as judged by pulse oximetry and clinical observation had returned.	2.906360636602796
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in this child was 60 min.	2.797922404842299
Epinephrine 1: 200 000 significantly prolongs the duration of spinal anaesthesia in former preterm infants.	3.294464854245876
Haemodynamic parameters in this age group remain unchanged during spinal anaesthesia and are not influenced by the addition of epinephrine.	3.669637043321951
Purpose: Debate about the potential implementation of Spiral-CT in diagnostic algorithms of pulmonary embolism are often focussed on sensitivity and specificity in the context of comparative methodologic studies.	3.3166758777853413
We intend to investigate whether additional factors might influence this debate.	3.5160040548139246
Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) should be an "evidence-based" diagnosis derived from clinical and echocardiographic screening of informed and consenting relatives of index patients, and on the examination of clinical reports for deceased relatives.	3.691232426779928
Most familial dilated cardiomyopathy pedigrees show an autosomal pattern of inheritance.	3.2243168461310034
Very few of them are X-linked and matrilinear.	3.473314163452291
Autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence-based setting.	3.5681410132140705
By linkage analysis, several loci, but no disease gene, have been identified.	4.029704149818185
At present, few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis.	3.1199101881779914
As the results of the structural reform policy regulating the health care sector, the paper presents the possible path of increasing intrasectoral risk selection and intersectoral risk externalization (especially between the law of health care insurance, the law of statutory nursing inusrance, and the German poverty law).	3.4849058953243928
Particularly the new developments in the hospital sector will be analzyed regarding the dynamics of risk selection and risk externalization.	3.8051657697007357
The new economic ways of financing the hospital sector are inducing the need of systematic integration of the different branches of social law, especially more developed networks of the health care, the nursing system, and the social care services.	4.017682973110162
Purpose: The inactive form of pyruvatekinase could be established in different tumours.	3.2106577801634244
Purpose of this study was to demonstate the presence or absence of the inactive form of pyruvatekinase in renal cell carcinoma, metastases and benign renal tissue by immunohistology.	3.5397131151262875
Materials and methods: The parameters included the blood loss volume, age, weight and sex of the patients, the mode of osteotomy and the operation time, the surgeon, the average blood pressure, the infusion volume, the anesthesiologist, the thrombocyte counts and their function, the activity of the coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and von-Willebrand-factor, and the pathological coagulation factor counts of each patient, the rate of autologous blood donation and the rate of retransfusion.	4.1267963040083755
Statistical analysis was done using the Speraman-Rho-test.	3.1565652223444665
Results: The average blood loss during maxillary osteotomy was 670  +/-  380 ml and during bimaxillary surgery 1120  +/-  510 ml.	2.8838707538441652
Men lost about 300 ml more than women.	3.1503342902909344
Operations of more than 3.5 h in length led to a blood loss of 1200  +/-  520 ml as opposed to 670  +/-  310 ml.	3.416861121968237
The average blood loss among various surgeons was between 670 ml and 1180 ml of various anesthesiologists between 730 ml and 1200 ml, without statistical evidence.	2.7785481405524237
Conclusion: Mode of operation, maxillary or bimaxillary, und length of operation were the most significant factors of intraoperative blood loss.	3.4170034113444943
Patients with pathological coagulation had nearly the same rate of blood loss as patients with physiological coagulation.	3.3376814385615887
In most cases this was determined by restriction of aspirin.	3.231617074055213
Analysis of the rate of autologous blood retransfusion showed a significant correlation to blood loss in bimaxillary surgery.	3.754167680268341
Maxillary osteotomy led to a retransfusion of only 14.2% of autologous blood unit.	3.6953385749819
This should be reviewed critically especially concerning costs.	2.915163806667809
Purpose: Course and pathophysiology of a typical syndrome after irradiation of the cauda equina were studied.	3.352448815383042
Wells' syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis) is a rare inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis.	3.827422472960728
We report on a 5-year-old girl who showed the typical biphasic and recurrent course of the disease: initially edematous-cellulitic lesions associated with blisters, followed by morphea-like changes on the extremities.	3.3080073004564103
Eosinophilia of peripheral blood was apparent, which, however, was not correlated with the severity of the current condition.	4.8324996549193155
After a recurrent course for 4 months and intermittent systemic administration of antibiotics (on the assumption of erysipelas and phlegmon) and glucocorticosteroids, the disease healed without sequelae.	3.3207896986627543
Trigger factors or systemic hematologic malignancy could not be detected.	3.519034534147783
Diskussion: Wells' syndrome is probably more common than believed and should be included in the differential diagnosis of urticarial, morphea-like and bullous eruptions in childhood.	3.1310910019744855
In 1996, several employees of the French governmental organization for Blood Collection and Transfusions (CNTS) have been condemned by ordinary courts.	2.8168690566235655
They were found guilty in the affair on HIV-infected blood transfusions.	3.1501501990687064
Over 3800 persons, mostly hemophiliacs, have been infected in France and suffer from HIV disease.	3.205951208962127
Many of them died already.	3.4083304697163808
The public in France urgently demanded the condemnation of the persons who were politically responsible for the time delay that postponed the introduction of HIV-tests for blood donations in France.	3.2706702430624195
Such a test was available from the american company ABBOTT in the early 1985, but the french authorities preferred to wait for the HIV-Test from Pasteur-Diagnostics.	3.3801067915700056
A special court, the "Court de Justice de la République", authorized to judge on members of  the governement, has been created by the French Parliament on Nov. 23, 1993.	2.8704532565169147
Six years later, the three politicians, the former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, the minister for  Social Affairs, Mme Georgina Dufoix, and  her undersecretary of state for health, Mr.  Edmond Hervé, have been accused of involuntary homicide.	2.6454926099055687
March, 9, 1999, after five weeks of deliberations and statements, the CJR rendered his sentence: The former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and the Minister  G. Dufoix were discharged, but the secretary of state for health, Edmond Hervé, has been declared guilty.	2.8843858811413097
However, also Mr. Hervé could leave the court room as a free person, because the President of the Court, Mr. Christian Le Gunehec, didn't want to pronounce a judgement against him, as Mr. Hervé had to suffer from almost 15 years of public  critics and attacks before he was found guilty.	2.709203455067019
The hemophiliacs and other AIDS-patients as well as their families protested loudly against this judgement.	3.5300042163236967
They plan to file charges against the three ministers through a common court to hold them responsible.	2.900481614622737
Classical insight therapy, derived from Freud, and `maternal' holding therapy, derived from Balint, Winnicott and others, are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis.	2.882610700668769
The authors believe that each of these two techniques presupposes specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings.	3.5736332320009137
The contra-position of the object relation psychologists stipulates the priority of love in human experience.	3.0686325191284065
These assumptions seem to be more latent than overt guidelines of therapeutical techniques and therefore their reconstruction and reformulation have important implications for psychoanalytical therapy.	3.2060991281360485
Univentricular hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations.	3.1672715557043585
We report a case of a 34-year old male with single ventricle, two atria, tricuspid atresia, large atrial septal defect, complete transposition and pulmonary valvar stenosis.	3.264486734850303
There were no signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension.	2.922927659909357
Intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years.	4.868028842788151
Conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation.	3.837551890151154
The patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession, family and some sportive activities like squash.	2.8269043962665528
He died of sudden cardiac death.	3.92460264330615
The malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development.	3.7250670075852597
Clinical picture, prognosis and therapy are reported from literature.	3.8681853015923777
During the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results.	3.1204224762959627
Special morphologic constellations, as in our case, may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life.	4.102627146820271
The assessment and measurement of pain is essential in the implementation and control of pain relieving strategies.	3.7577432666126067
The measurement of pain in infants and children should be based on the consideration of age, cognitive level, psychological status, intercurrent diseases and the social context in order to register the child's individual situation and to avoid misinterpretation.	3.9477585204451424
From its origin to its death the human organism is submitted to functional, material and morphological changes that are perceptible.	3.123325454281531
These changes permit classifying an individual as young, adult, old, active or infirm.	2.8466785140249744
But this estimation is not always correct.	3.7614347666528163
But what is ageing and how can it be measured?	3.569250677873091
For this, so-called markers or biological markers of ageing are used which are measurable indicators of ageing in live organisms.	3.1639333069400504
A description of the complexity, the asynchronous course and the biological variety and variability of biological age is less successful with a single indicator than with the inclusion of several markers in a multi-factorial measuring system, in a so-called test battery.	3.9627363154978728
Various test batteries have already been applied in numerous studies that consist of biochemical scans, mental and also social parameters in different combinations.	3.25358247607228
A more precise description of such a test battery can be seen in the following discussion of the ILSE study.	4.171770578821507
The documentation form for pathohistologic findings (version III) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented.	3.316776249761666
It is part of the site-specific documentation of the German Association of Tumor Centers (ADT).	3.8156299790073365
Its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the ICD-O classification and the TNM system.	3.8078583554195893
The prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	3.1698657265761074
The development of a middle ear cholesteatoma is usually associated with chronic inflammation and displacement of the mucosa present by the invading squamous epithelium.	3.3390943900058705
To analyze the clinically different behaviors of both epithelia, we used immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and expression of interleukin-1 (Il-1), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-), epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), the proliferation marker MIB 1, c-myc proto-oncogene product and activation marker 4F2.	3.6085292495820096
Results stromal that keratinocytes in a cholesteatoma exhibited a much higher activation and proliferation rate when compared to middle ear mucosa cells.	3.3104690906263525
Middle ear epithelial cells showed no immunoreactivity for TGF-alpha, EGF-R, Il-1 and c-myc in contrast to the markedly positive immunoreactivity found in cholesteatoma matrix.	3.2511005942344386
The local release of cytokines and growth factors, such as TGF-alpha, EGF and Il-1 by inflammatory cells seems to be an important factor for the hyperproliferative behavior of cholesteatoma epithelium.	3.4518060528609333
Our findings could contribute to the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma and give a possible explanation for the sustained progression of its growth leading to displacement of the middle ear mucosa.	3.9971889659605613
The role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter.	3.278187770963831
This paper reports the results of the Austrian ultrasound hip screening program, in which all Austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice: at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12-16 weeks.	3.6785460444292797
Data from all public health insurance companies since 1985 and all ICD data about children hospitalized because of CDH in Austria were collected and analyzed.	3.014575577136137
The rate of sonographically pathological hips was 6.57 % (1994).	2.7029398502343476
The treatment rate before introduction of hip sonography was 13.16 % (1985).	3.0636527225928387
The rate of open reduction went down to 0.24 per 1000 newborns, including a high number of unscreened children born abroad and also children with teratological dislocation of the hip.	3.135198251427734
Hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia.	4.718493118789937
The optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only "high risk" hips (clinical instability, positive family history, breech delivery) should undergo hip sonography, but at an age between 4 and 6 weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature.	3.1561194631615637
Since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening, a further reduction of costs could be accomplished.	3.7564352968883736
Disability owing to DDH can be avoided in a number of cases, and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be economized.	4.589964388890354
Transactional analysis (Berne 1958) in its original concepts was intended to help even lay people to understand personal structures and psychodynamic processes.	2.980356851115573
This intention lead some of the following authors to superficiality and a "happy-go-lucky" perspective.	3.504179761087676
Others, most of all European transactional analysts went back to the roots of the original contents and aims and showed that they offer great clinical relevance for the understanding and treatment of a variety of disturbances.	4.0902885561172635
This article will illustrate these aspects, using the borderline syndrome as an example.	3.465534422770944
The structural model of egostates serves to describe the borderline structure, concepts of the frame of reference and the script as patterns for the development and maintenance of the pathology, the concepts of transactions, games, symbioses and passivity as indicators for the stable instability of the relationships, and devaluations and grandiosities as examples of defence patterns.	3.225236877922858
Practical ideas about the therapeutic contract as a basis of various working agreements, about methods of decreasing anxiety in therapeutic processes, and about contact and attachment as a substrate for corrective experiences, a healing atmosphere and dedramatisation of the process follow.	2.950869644174832
The article ends with transactional analytic considerations of transference, counter-transference and how to deal with regression processes.	2.769042105376312
The disturbance of generalized cheerfulness (serene-calmness disorder) is an illness, which is often recognised very late.	3.639935477454045
It is characterised by a uniformity of psychic experience in the face of circumstances which would otherwise give cause for depressiveness, despair, great anxiety, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.	3.008879494834351
Early diagnosis and specific therapy may decisively improve life-quality of the patients and may also prevent detrimental individual and social long-term consequences.	4.587993673509852
Disturbances of microcirculation in coronary artery disease can be seen in the presence of critical stenosis of epicardial coronary arteries, as a result of endothelial dysfunction in the absence of significant stenosis or during recovery of ischaemic myocardium after successful angioplasty of stenosed or occluded coronary arteries.	4.095422671167014
Diagnostic methods are morphologic/morphometric analyses, measurement of the global coronary reserve, measurement of the regional coronary microcirculation (scintigraphy, positron emission tomography) and laboratory analysis of haemorheological alterations (plasma, erythrocytes, leucocytes).	3.0264380029114215
After successful angioplasty, normalisation of glutamate extraction rate takes three to six months.	2.737316019582517
In patients with unstable angina, changes in plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil activation occur.	3.081136402354564
Neutrophils are activated after successful angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction and even after elective angioplasty (when measured in the coronary sinus).	3.7567874978810827
Therapeutic improvements of disturbed microvascular flow can be obtained by increasing perfusion pressure (by revascularisation, nitrates, calcium antagnoists, physical training), by improving the fluidity of the blood and by reducing the extravascular component of coronary vascular resistance (by antihypertensive treatment).	3.298764553077343
Intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI) extracted from testicular tissue (TESE) represents the only possibility for men with non-obstructive azoospermia to father a child.	3.1345032534090005
ICSI is also the only treatment for men with obstructive azoospermia if microsurgery is not possible or not successful.	3.8055118187008685
However, approximately only every fifth treatment cycle leads to a pregnancy.	3.3178416732791036
Thus, in most cases, several treatment cycles have to be performed to achieve a pregnancy and therefore testicular biopsies have to be taken several times.	4.265420559353522
Cryopreservation of testicular tissue offers the possibility to store testicular tissue for several treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and to detach surgical sperm retrieval in the man and infertility treatment in the woman (ovarian stimulation, ovum pick-up, embryo transfer).	3.2484947086411053
For the man, cryopreservation offers the advantage that only one testicular biopsy has to be performed for diagnostic reasons and for sperm retrieval.	3.5770962499283074
The advantage for the women is that infertility treatment is started only if testicular histology confirms spermatids, at least in the testicular tissue.	3.107745983999393
The cumulative pregnancy rate of IVF/ICSI/TESE-cycles can be increased by cryopreservation of supernumerary pronuclear stage oocytes and embryo transfer after thawing in successive cycles.	2.655755515235383
A main paediatric and obstetric journal (Archiv für Kinderheilkunde, Archiv für Gynäkologie) from the turn of the century were analysed including the years 1885-1910.	2.6595145526865944
Purpose: To compare electron beam CT (EBCT) und prospectively ECG gated conventional CT for the detection and quantification of coronary artery calcifications.	3.636405765644863
In Europe, saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery.	2.7195499120404194
From the pathogenetic point of view, it is a colonization of preexisting lung or pleural cavities following other severe pulmonary diseases.	3.1695318705170266
The incidence amounts to 0.4% among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases.	3.4090106448163637
Concerning this review, the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all 66 patients we operated on between 1961 and 1996.	4.066458709365645
Preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult.	3.2098269987246084
The majority of patients (77%) are male.	3.588408474830256
There is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand.	3.807503528484019
A higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in agriculture, in the building trade, and in paper mills.	3.732550171612992
Pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47% of the patients.	4.323647328514147
Usually, the tentative diagnosis is based on chest x-ray, especially if hemoptysis is present.	3.948946960134452
Major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma.	3.6092473747954057
Clinical presentation and chest x-ray findings are non-characteristic.	3.3121534675355657
Nowadays, the typical x-ray of pulmonary aspergilloma, almost always localized in the upper lobes, became a rare finding.	3.9999540641242963
If an aspergillus infection is suspected, serologic methods are reliable and sensitive.	3.2020429631638794
A surgical procedure is absolutely indicated in patients with major hemoptysis in their history, in case of disease progression or indeterminate mass and in order to avoid fungal dissemination.	4.092891631558128
If a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings, clinical examination, and patient's social history, an operation is justified.	3.432117833775969
Relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the mycotoxins.	3.594692631670577
The lobectomy, if necessary carried out as pleuro-lobectomy, is the adequate resection in most patients (68%).	3.6159237862896156
However, this operation is technically demanding and it usually requires a longer operating time as compared to lobectomies for other underlying diseases.	3.1558133449762384
Peri- and postoperative complications occur in 60% of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma.	3.8439978131584587
A higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections, like segmentectomies or wedge resections, as compared to lobectomies.	3.720641436616267
Persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem.	3.9779078397213428
It requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients.	3.721452195486836
The operative mortality rate is 3%.	3.3799940503138077
A systemic antifungal therapy is not an appropriate treatment for saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis and can even cause specific complications.	3.520674398589426
Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common psychic disturbance occurring acutely after various surgical procedures and typically presenting with a fluctuating course.	3.510279181347496
These patients' recovery takes longer.	3.1736835736269384
In this study we analyze the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing vascular surgery and try to identify risk factors for its development.	3.738207768331734
Methods: Patients undergoing elective arterial operations were included.	3.21351158779858
Their medical history, the specific vascular diagnosis and operation performed, the medication and laboratory data were monitored.	3.7377474554912986
Additionally the patients were preoperatively interviewed by a psychiatrist.	3.830389322794335
Intraoperatively the drugs, infusions, possible transfusions, blood gases and pressures were monitored, as were the times of surgery and anesthesia.	3.5294399895284263
Postoperatively patients were seen daily by the psychiatrist and the surgeon for at least 7 days.	3.287756743871495
Postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria, and mild, moderate and severe delirium were distinguished.	3.3572854774264296
Results: Fifty-four patients entered the study.	3.304688672516391
Twenty-one (38.9 %) developed postoperative delirium (11 mild, 2 moderate, 8 severe).	2.967502539738128
Patients with aortic operations developed delirium more frequently than those with non-aortic procedures(55.5 vs 22.2 %, n = 27 each).	3.1914120316739174
Some preexisting diseases (hearing disturbance) increased the probability of postoperative delirium, while age was not identified as a risk factor.	3.6093236334138368
General psychopathological and depressive disturbances increased the likelihood of postoperative delirium.	3.303463289375664
Patients who had a severe intraoperative course developed postoperative delirium more frequently.	3.380522169013239
This was not seen in the absolute time of surgery or anesthesia nor in the intraoperative development of blood pressure or intraarterial gases, which did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium.	3.6706286742842735
More reliable parameters were an increased intraoperative need for crystalloid volume, intra - or postoperatively decreased hemoglobin values (Hb < 10 g/dl) and the development of acidosis that had to be treated.	4.129283732759255
Patients with delirium had serious complications more often (8/21 = 38.1 % vs 6/33 = 18.2 %) and needed Intensive Care treatment longer (2.7 vs 2.1 days, only aortic surgery 3.2 vs 2.4 days).	2.7630792029340396
Conclusions: Postoperative delirium after vascular surgery is frequent.	3.432501804819871
Patients undergoing aortic surgery, with specific concomittant medical disease, psychopathological disturbances and a severe intraoperative course, are at risk of developing postoperative delirium.	3.293118069737371
This report summarizes our experiences with the subjective visual vertical (SVV) as a clinical neuro-otological tool.	3.460134416626829
Normal subjects in an upright position did not deviate more than 2 ° from true vertical.	3.1407448617872373
After vestibular neurectomy, the SVV was consistently tilted by some 12 ° toward the affected ear.	3.0816269237541545
Smaller tilts (~7 °) of the SVV occured in patients with spontaneous peripheral vestibular diseases.	4.940474371515883
This shift in SVV disappeared within weeks to months, similar to the spontaneous nystagmus.	3.4291708154328244
After stapes surgery slight deviations of the SVV towards the unoperated ear were seen in about 20% of the patients, indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs.	3.6132553096445164
Assessed in an upright position, the SVV thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic otolithic input differences between the two ears.	3.7916228626542727
Introduction: Vocal cord paralysis is a important complication in thyroid gland surgery.	3.0443299874775565
A prospective study was conducted ascertain the frequency of laryngeal nerve palsy not caused by surgical trauma.	3.5580292197771084
Patients and Methods: Two hundred and ten patients were investigated laryngoscopically pre- and postoperatively after short-term intubation in the course of operations far removed from thorax or neck region.	3.589348054789561
We noted the inner diameter of the tube, intubation problems, the qualification of the anaesthesiologist and the positioning of the patient.	3.834220598145912
Postoperatively there were pathological findings of vocal cords in 13 patients (6.2 %).	3.5150944669818136
In 10 patients a direct lesion (oedema, rubor, haematoma, granuloma) was established.	2.991709639697369
Three patients (1.4 %) were found to have a movement disorder caused by a neural lesion without morphological findings, leading to restitutio ad integrum in two of three cases after 6 months.	3.6225116494774787
Conclusion: The frequency of intubation-related recurrent nerve palsy is 1.4 % transiently and 0.5 % permanently.	3.1756589147784497
Preoperative laryngoscopic investigation of vocal cords should be carried out before intubation.	3.5585941639808336
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are the most frequent infections cause of genital ulcerations.	4.372776450309895
Although genital infections by HSV-1 are increasing HSV-2 is dominant in recurrent infections.	3.1197939221328417
This study was conducted on a panel of sera collected anonymously in 1996 and 1997 from blood donors (1979 samples) and hospital patients (3079 samples) without risk factors for herpesvirus infections such as STD, other infectious diseases and immunosuppression.	2.945643005278207
Serum samples were tested with ELISAs using monoclonal antibody-selected native gG1 and gG2 as antigens and an immunoblot using type-specific recombinant glycoproteins.	2.8562651650458326
Equivocal results were confirmed with an in-house Western blot.	3.388342043244076
This study investigates the effects of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator, and the lipid peroxidation inhibitor U-101033E on neurological outcome following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.	3.2511620803755785
We report on three family members suffering from both autosomal dominant Hailey-Hailey disease and bipolar affective disorder.	2.4315950557998103
As molecular biology techniques have made the localization of genes causing simple Mendelian traits possible as a routine task, the gene for Hailey-Hailey disease will presumably be localized in the foreseeable future.	3.134925154522523
The Hailey-Hailey gene and its chromosomal surrounding will then be a region of interest for linkage studies in bipolar affective disorder.	2.9602365910534525
Background: Osteoporotic fractures occur frequently also in men.	3.188465032152007
Epidemiologic data from Germany indicate that more than 900,000 men are affected by osteoporotic fractures.	2.967487616483464
Diagnosis and therapy of male osteoporosis are hampered by a lack of clinical studies.	3.6352077449364377
Recurrent headaches and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) are the most common pain syndromes in childhood: The prevalence of tension headache amounts to 20-50 %, of migraine to 5-7 % and of RAP to 15-30 %.	3.5363202286930373
In nearly 50 % of children the complaints persist over many years of their life-span.	2.604320827550892
The unfavourable long-term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions.	3.2182301480158513
Empirical findings on the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology are still very limited.	2.889312327078109
Actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance, and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences.	2.8601257038423187
The behavioral-medicine proceeding bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis.	2.831004741174955
The psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis (stress inoculation, cognitive redefinition, problem solving), reduction of pain symptoms (relaxation, distraction, imagination) and environmental modification (parental reinforcement and modeling behavior).	2.653391205229564
During the last years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioral pain management programs for children.	2.3608965447254837
The aim of our study was to develop noninvasive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with choroidal metastases.	2.8789255336338693
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is standard therapy for urolithiasis.	2.8059542088289784
With comparable technical principles, various lithotripters have been developed and are in routine use.	3.428065199405764
Renal pelvic stones, calyceal stones, ureteral stones, and other special forms can be treated with varying results.	3.4301117240288463
Currently, the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the recurrence of calculi are under discussion.	3.167422554865781
Whereas the side effects of ESWL are well known, studies comparing ESWL with other endourological procedures are still lacking.	3.276121933811748
Suramin has long been used in the treatment of onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.	4.062738405190048
Recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines.	2.9699889704537874
Ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma.	4.069640038032453
Five patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma resistant to classic hormonal therapy were treated with high-dose suramin.	3.893454798295988
Four of the five developed a papulovesicular or maculopapular rash within 2 - 4 weeks of starting therapy.	3.273846520021827
The rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within 10 days.	3.3174237011300227
In tumour therapy, high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of 200 - 300 µg/ml.	3.6330454051324517
Therefore, a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes.	3.120740037350061
Acetylcholinesterase (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is supposed to be an uncommon cause for oropharyngeal edema.	3.580860540677969
Between January 1, 1993 and February 1, 1997 we treated 20 patients with edema of the oropharyngeal region that was not caused by infection or irradiation.	3.302481966368094
The most common reason was an ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema and occurred in 9 cases, all of whom required inpatient treatment.	3.0543160741488453
The medical management consisted of the administra- tion of intravenous (i.v.)	3.2308997619455293
glucocorticosteroids in all cases, H1-blockers in 6 cases, epinephrine by inhalation in one case and i.v.	3.8231874668802304
Tracheostomy had to be performed in one patient.	5.048745888328929
In our experience it is necessary to reconsider ACE inhibitor-induced angioedma in any case of an oropharyngeal edema.	3.4039752114254265
However, there is no reason for the routine application of epinephrine in these cases.	4.036273265031769
After treatment of more than 3000 kidney and ureteral stones with the Siemens Lithostar Multiline the results of the first 1400 ureteral stone treatments using the "Booster technique" and 3-month follow-up findings are reported.	3.7585414327747464
There was a disintegration rate of 98 % directly after treatment; 1 week after "Booster technique" treatment 96 % of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms.	3.175230581272901
The 3-month follow-up showed a stone-free rate of 97 %.	3.524682219494816
Only in 13 % of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary, 7 % of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and 6 % after ESWL.	3.143617794272438
43 % of the treatments were performed without any premedication, anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia.	3.5266367805701417
Our data even prove that in situ ESWL is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones.	3.418849470949867
In comparison to endoscopic procedures, it is superior in regard to invasivity, side effects, complications and neccessity of analgesia, while being just as efficient.	3.8012292440845297
Therefore it is recommended as first choice method in the treatment of ureteral stones.	3.7016526159633276
The perspectives for active hearing implants lie in the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).	3.293478329648013
The majority of patients with SNHL suffer from a cochlea amplifier (CA) failure which is discernible by a positive recruitment and loss of otoacoustic emissions (OAE).	3.0131300182836864
Therefore, the electronic implant is expected to partially replace functions of the CA.	3.1773721058808793
Thus, the implant is thought to function as a CAI (cochlea amplifier implant).	3.264763685025897
An approved implant for routine use is not yet available.	3.9886769862531475
Clinical studies have thus far only used the high energy consuming (HEC), narrow-band, electromagnetic floating-mass transducer, as well as the Maniglia-HEC implant.	3.0345447415550235
The high energie consuming, yet broadband Canadian Fredrickson implant is soon to be used in humans.	3.204848181778536
Of the piezoelectrical implants, a German CAI (Tübingen implant) at present consisting of a piezoelectrical transducer and a microphone has thus far been acutely implanted in first patient.	2.9388732975018934
It is a low energy consuming (LEC), broad-band implantable system for patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	3.213259997829735
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) was de-scribed electroclinically by Janz and Christian in 1957 and consists of myoclonic jerks in  varying combination with the absence of seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a typical circadian distribution on awakening, sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption and flickering stimuli as characteristic precipitating factors, typical EEG abnormalities with generalized epileptiform discharges, normal physical and neuroradiological findings, and often a family history of epilepsy.	2.9626530255479357
Although the misdiagnosis of this well-classified and easily treatable syndrome is supposed to occur rarely in Germany, we retrospectively investigated how often the wrong initial classification had been made among patients who were finally treated in our outpatient epilepsy unit.	3.59502446153537
Between 1993 and 1995, 30 patients with a typical JME-like symptom constellation were identified who had been misdiagnosed initially.	3.9347674705515843
In all patients, localization-related epilepsy had been classified, although regional EEG abnormalities were rare (n=5).	2.8319058751901913
All patients reported the typical circadian distribution, abnormal neuroradiological findings were absent, and typical EEG abnormalities were present in all cases.	3.3285221814962385
Under treatment with appropiate antiepileptic drugs 97% of the patients became almost completely seizure-free.	3.7984261764617666
Even 40 years after the first description of the syndrome, JME is an underdiagnosed illness.	4.446342318478634
The generally  positive course underlines the importance of its correct identification.	3.483457764685241
Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate results of visual acuity and binocularity and complications after cataract surgery with primary capsular bag-fixated IOL implantation in children.	2.959628637456619
Arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease.	3.7366252072254653
Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the perifoveal microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension.	3.876537931767205
During follow-up a progression of these alterations has been reported.	3.680448960402231
In the present study we quantified the retinal microcirculation of patients with hypertension under different systemic antihypertensive medication.	3.2073454354338056
Vaginal and uterine bleeding is a common symptom in gynecology.	3.425534599114374
First, the basic circulation parameters should be determined.	3.0894916992853916
Blood volume and oxygen substitution are essential.	3.446551408341448
Depending on these findings, further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken.	3.5399506270504153
If the situation is stable, diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor.	3.5663495165403236
A general examination, including a vaginal and rectal examination, must be performed.	3.615235848592885
Other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound (vaginal and transabdominal) and CT or MRI may be required.	3.320437747134361
Medium-term results with a follow-up of at least 3 years were done in 160 patients (average follow up 51 months) after ACL reconstruction using IKDC evaluation form and Noyes score and in 110 patients (average follow Up 53 months) after non-operative management.	4.222579724773387
Unlike objective good parameters the subjective assessment of knee function according to the Noyes score reveals significantly worse results in cases with ACL reconstruction compared to the knees without surgery.	3.9546753508219723
The best functional results we found in professional athletes after ACL reconstruction.	3.42810637609458
Comparable positive results of knee function is only achieved in approx.	3.587445945510023
15 % of the patients from the natural history group, who can maintain high risk pivoting activity level feeling no giving way.	3.857015288638434
In our opinion compensatory proprioceptive mechanism account for the surpassing results in these two groups of patients.	3.3625393498881033
It will be postulated that it is not the absolute power of the hamstring but the latency period of recruition that influences the compensation of anterior knee instability.	3.3147288836878213
We have modified our rehabilitation methods in order to improve proprioception and dynamic stability of the ACL-deficient knee.	3.8668943199314496
Based on our results we primarily limitate the ACL reconstruction on a group of patients practicing high-risk-pivoting sports.	3.388073792767352
Only when menisceal lesions appear or patients suffer from giving way episodes we support secondary surgery.	2.89197221167924
The pivot shift sign is reflecting the dynamic aspect of knee instability.	3.005542500694073
In our opinion it is the decisive parameter to assess knee instability unless there are useful technical procederes.	2.9222818768450916
Multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem.	4.738597687348189
The present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged 65 years or more.	3.531738272602707
A total of 1154 multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS) of at least 18 points were divided in two age groups: Y: 16 - 64 years, n = 1022; O: 65 - 94 years, n = 132.	3.540498434248615
Older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases (69%), while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers (41%).	3.7501977568690874
ISS was comparable in both groups (Y 28 +/- 1, O 27 +/- 1).	4.561816431291265
During ICU-therapy incidence of ARDS (Y 10%, O 11%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF; Y 6%, O 9%) and pneumonia (Y 17%, O 21%) were comparable.	3.1680862149211353
In contrast, septic complications were more frequent in older patients (Y 19%, O 27%).	3.435770606499667
Length of ICU stay (Y 19 +/- 2, O 18 +/- 1) and ventilation time (Y 14 +/- 2, O 17 +/- 1) were comparable.	4.3617649659151905
Mortality was significantly higher in older patients (Y 15%, O 53%).	3.12897273055178
The major cause of death was sepsis in older patients (Y 15%, O 31%) and MOF in younger patients (Y 54%, O 29%).	2.9297570305124374
In conclusion, older trauma patients had a higher mortality due to the development of septical complications.	4.5140305325701195
The Raynaud phenomenon occurs in 90-100% of patients with systemic scleroderma.	4.386075748665587
It is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between vasocontrictive and vasodilatory influences.	3.278989276071755
Early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances.	4.056550087881787
Structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm.	3.292649708236268
New vasodilatory treatment strategies, e.g.	2.944062147437791
infusions with calcitonin gene-related peptides, could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma.	4.047005193957309
Due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence, strong efforts were made to find non-pharmacological strategies.	3.507299821867104
For three years now, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix from InControl has been available as an alternative therapy.	2.9990610573175096
From October 1995 to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in 179 patients worldwide.	3.402846534006215
The sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90%; the specifity to detect sinus rhythm is 100%.	3.4621705593486465
In 121 of 179 patients, 748 episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with 2.4 shocks per episode.	3.308243228214376
No proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen.	3.145317545057049
A cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95% of patients; the overall clinical success rate was 88%.	3.8427394403125787
In 7% of all patients, early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further cardioversions and antiarrhythmic therapy.	3.8080245927582066
In 4.1% there were lead-related complications, in 4 patients the device had to be explanted because of ineffective therapy, and in 3 patients the device had to be changed because of loss of telemetry or early depletion of battery.	3.744552942673192
In 8 patients, postoperative complications were seen (infections, pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein).	3.6511637876505825
Overall, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation.	3.322705919426423
Background: The success rate of combined glaucoma and small incision cataract surgery is not yet established.	3.675340020367502
The somatosensory system of preterms and newborns differs substantially from adults.	2.9559981227076153
These differences are of considerable preclinical and clinical interest.	3.3691510388277086
Maturation of A- and C-fibre synaptic connections in the dorsal horn and development of descending inhibition from the brainstem all take place postnatally in the rat.	3.256516019374803
In early stages of development there is no definite spatial sepraration in the dorsal horn between the nociceptive and the non-nociceptive system.	3.4559438956772617
In preterms but not in adults non-noxious stimuli can induce central sensitization.	3.2018056586245427
Many neurotransmitters and signalling molecules involved in pain pathways are expressed early in the developing nervous system but do not reach adult levels for a considerable period.	3.064801744619083
More important, receptors are frequently transiently overexpressed or expressed in areas during development where they are not seen in the adult and may have a different functional profile.	3.4966394566862986
The descending pain inhibitory system that provides an important protection against central sensitization developes later than the ascending nociceptive system.	3.027444753937957
Thus, during a critical period of time the immature nociceptive system is highly vulnerable.	3.494437768443694
For example, neonatal circumcision in the absence of analgesia results in increased pain responses during subsequent routine vaccination months later.	3.010577711955804
Numerous studies conducted during the past decades indicate that the public's attitude toward the mentally ill is strongly prejudiced.	3.0697950612227474
Since the attitude of the general public also has an effect on community-based psychiatric care, we must ask how public opinion might be influenced.	3.353765042144775
One possible approach could be through so-called key community leaders - those who are highly respected in society because of their competence in a particular area.	3.382606655174032
Doctors belong to this group of people.	3.6814051661550256
For this reason we questioned medical students, as future key community leaders, with respect to their attitudes toward the mentally ill within the framework of their first contact with psychiatric patients during their studies.	3.0766252161606658
In order to make a direct comparison possible, we interviewed a sample of the Mannheim population who live in a part of the city where a variety of complementary facilities have been set up.	3.504255088903029
The comparison shows that medical students do not have a more positive attitude toward the mentally ill; in fact, in certain areas they have an even more negative attitude toward the mentally ill than the general population has.	3.1894357882222226
We were not able to establish what effect teaching has with respect to changing attitudes.	3.134783475298066
Systematic lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer aims to remove potentially metastatic lymph nodes from the tumor's drainage basin.	3.080408596135098
This requires knowledge of normal lymphatic anatomy and metastatic routes.	3.0395901177673443
Systematic lymphadenectomy performed as a standard or as an extended resection is a prerequisite for pathologic tumor staging.	3.708749986342578
An intensive search by the pathologist for lymph node metastases is critical for precise staging.	3.2847972026432215
Recommendations as to the extent of lymphadenectomy are derived from potential improvement of prognosis and procedure-related complications.	3.7895995729450345
Life threatening hemorrhage in patients with malignant tumours of the head and neck area are often, as a result of tumour infiltration, postoperative anatomical changes, infection and radiological necrosis, difficult to control.	3.9523623379647885
One option for prophylaxis and treatment is the ligature of the external (ECA) or common carotid artery (CCA) and superior thyroid artery (STA).	3.5177980116581278
52 patients were examined in a retrospective study to determine both the hazards and the therapeutic use of the procedure.	5.372024373949111
The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated prophylactically during the operative procedure of tumour resection and neck dissection in 25 patients.	3.7130119399924926
In 27 cases closure of the ECA, CCA or ECA and STA was carried out as an emergency procedure for acute hemorrhage following completed primary treatment (operation, primary or postoperative radiation or radiochemotherapy).	3.0239169921284876
There was no postoperative hemorrhage after prophylactic ligature of the ECA.	2.8640274710687086
One patient with multiple cardiovascular diseases suffered from an ipsilateral cerebral infarction 1 year after operation.	3.147592533131219
In 6 of 9 patients and in all 3 patients, in whom ligature of the CCA or ECA and STA respectively was carried out as an emergency procedure, severe neurological complications up to an apallic syndrome occured.	3.3802208863766423
The number of deaths due to acute hemorrhage was considerably smaller among those patients with prophylactic ligature of the ECA performed during operative procedure of tumor resection and neck dissection.	3.125799550507018
In addition there were much less unfavourable courses in the sequence of prophylactic closure of the ECA than observed after ligating the CCA or ECA and STA in an emergency situation.	2.7456510763729605
The carcinoid tumor of the middle ear is a very rare neoplasm which in general is regarded as benign but may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma because of its histological heterogeneity.	3.708066003795406
Typical, however, is its neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation so that an unequivocal diagnosis is possible by means of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.	3.959141520207935
As the tumor is very rare, there is no statistical evidence as to whether further treatment is necessary after primary exstirpation of the tumor.	3.9249801734912175
Therefore, a review of the literature was performed.	3.297360763401684
We report about a 28-year-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor of the left tympanic cavity.	3.1427776591444783
Without any further treatment there has been no evidence for either recurrence or metastases 32 months after surgical resection.	3.501249245191277
As treatment of choice we recommend conservative surgery with complete removal of the tumor and a clinical follow-up on a regular basis.	4.739196166600556
Intraoperative precision in computer-assisted surgery depends on the characteristics of a navigation system, the precision of correlation between object and data set, the position, number and fixation of landmarks, and the parameters of the data set.	4.03136228116321
The characteristics of a navigation system, in particular the immanent precision, can be detected by the use of the geometric model and navigation analyzer developed at the University of Regensburg with the support of Carl Zeiss, Germany.	3.74069191869429
The precision of five navigation systems of different types and technology was measured: Viewing Wand (ISG, mechanical system), the SMN microscope (Carl Zeiss, infrared system with laser autofocus), the MKM system (Carl Zeiss, robot platform with laser autofocus) and the STP pointer (Leibinger, infrared system).	3.2610502729284847
The immanent precision of these systems ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 mm.	3.3022174154346455
An electromagnetic system (3-Space Digitizer, Polhemus) was compared; this produces serious spherical deviations of 10.0 to 20.0 mm in the presence of metal, surgical and rotating instruments, and circuits.	3.2782324676483134
The application of these different systems for craniomaxillofacial surgery is discussed.	2.769259839761928
The aim of the study was to record retrospectively the events of Pneumocystis carinii-Pneumonia (PCP) among HIV-infected children (<18 years) in Germany.	2.9946185697064944
The patients were evaluated with regard to prophylaxis, course of disease and prognosis.	4.917081443910224
In this study we looked at the relationship between extracorporal circulation and changes in blood electrolytes.	3.281367637508094
Glucocorticoids are a potent cause of osteoporosis and thus a potential source of substantial morbidity in patients who are already significantly disabled by their underlying condition.	3.589512917324604
These agent interact with calcium metabolism at many levels; in particular they reduce the osteoblast's synthesis of the principal proteins of bone matrix.	2.9799686430691987
They also reduce circulating sex hormone concentrations, particularly in men and postmenopausal women.	3.2587024541760026
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract, have not yet been fully investigated.	3.625856757570441
Between 1994 and 1998, 18 GIST patients underwere operation in the Department of Surgery.	3.3026050763567096
The primary tumor could be removed in all patients with R0 resection.	4.2290630650756205
Six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis, with the size of their primary tumor exceeding 10 cm.	3.6935479287135426
Extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case.	3.868913393492616
Lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur.	3.656252490420022
Histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of Lewin, Weinstein and Riddell.	3.1727655771524423
Currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases.	4.692213483628502
Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have failed.	3.330117917021205
Acute leptospirosis in Europe (Weil's disease) is a rare and in more than 90 % of the cases undiagnosed febrile, self-limited disease.	4.282483859588749
We report the case of a 39-year-old sewerage worker, who was admitted to our hospital with fever, jaundice, pain in his calves and acute renal failure.	2.9845589688736363
Serology revealed elevated antibody titers against Leptospira canicola, L. icterhaemorrhagica and L. sejroe.	2.936604748410664
The patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.	2.63835913723221
The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm.	2.9724454349873723
Autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized leptospiral infection, signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient.	3.2533782887772555
The virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic tracheitis and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue.	3.011556175802736
A medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given, the disease being recognized as an occupational disease.	3.228273086229936
During the past decade, the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become better understood.	3.363436329183142
Cancer metastasis consists of multiple, complex interacting steps.	3.4270317134390744
Each of these steps is crucial and limiting, since a failure to complete any one prevents the tumor cell from producing a metastasis.	2.923450650211881
Detachment from the solid tumor by loosening the intercellular junctions and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix enables tumor cells to enter blood- and lymph vessels.	3.1332526850051443
The intravasation into the circulation is supported by the secretion of angiogenic factors, which induce degradation of the basal membran in blood vessels.	3.405200316512574
Adhesion to endothelial cells, extravasation from the circulation, and induction of angiogenesis are further essential steps for completing the metastatic process.	3.1887523910020636
Furthermore, it is well known that once a tumor cell has entered circulation, it will survive only by evasion of the immune system.	3.2461058556391733
The systematic identification of tumor antigens opens up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic approaches.	2.79455528779462
Hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male.	3.4323775991253958
The choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible.	3.3811932337306296
To date, transdermal testosterone systems appear to be best suited for substitution therapy in the ageing male.	2.943246428584179
Future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate.	2.9816550355782834
Any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely, especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate.	3.7044087630184843
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a disease that involves the lining of joints, bursae and tendon sheaths.	3.3256061124733916
The incidence is low and estimated to be 1.8 patients per million population.	3.2371918456557065
The cause of PVNS is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic.	3.0611686531383886
PVNS has been described in 2 forms different for prognosis and treatment (nodular and diffuse).	3.691976739355141
The articular form almost appeares in the knee joint as we describe below in a 14 year-old patient.	3.5344134499723854
In this retrospective study, 13 patients with subtle Lisfranc joint injuries were examined after a mean period of 23 months using clinical assessment, radiography and dynamic pedographic gait analysis.	2.9581606312377215
The aims were to identify the factors leading to a mobile flatfoot deformity, evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of these injuries, and draw practical conclusions for initial management and subsequent intervention.	3.360164164948277
All patients showed a mobile flatfoot deformity, increased motion in the subtalar joint, increased load on the hindfoot, decreased load on the forefoot, and a prolonged contact phase during the stance phase.	3.417657017440912
Radiographs revealed progressive osteoarthrosis in the joint and a residual displacement of the medial Lisfranc joint.	3.996336900925975
An unstable medial Lisfranc joint results in the development of a mobile flatfoot.	4.6606762443980205
Initial treatment of a subtly displaced Lisfranc joint should consist of exact anatomical reduction and additional maintenance of the longitudinal arch of the foot.	3.2565527885343197
After failed initial treatment, early arthrodesis of the midfoot is recommended as a salvage procedure for the foot.	3.5881852334405493
Cross-sectional imaging with CT and MRI plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic workup and staging of laryngeal neoplasms.	3.095283558657765
Adequate interpretation of the CT and MR images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and familiarity with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality.	3.662843537164096
Both CT and MR imaging are highly sensitive for the detection of neoplastic invasion of the pre-epiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottic region and cartilage.	3.728065611660464
The high negative predictive value of both CT and MRI allows exclusion of neoplastic cartilage invasion quite reliably.	3.4323726788821305
The specificity of both CT and MRI is, however, limited and both methods may therefore overestimate the extent of tumor spread.	3.8285705210061787
Nevertheless, both cross-sectional imaging methods significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy.	3.706753482775525
In the presence of a submucosal mass, CT and MRI play a key role for the diagnosis, as they may characterize the lesion, reliably depict its submucosal extent, and guide the endoscopist to perform deep biopsies that allow a definitive histological diagnosis.	3.526690019687966
Background: HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.	3.1408748254463634
Organ culture storage leads to loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.	3.1751821434835783
This study investigates the importance of prolonged storage period for the success rate after penetrating keratoplasty.	3.970695464406352
Ergotamine-containing drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.	3.9554618604961225
Among others, spastic vasoconstrictions are one of the possible side effects usually affecting the lower extremities and sometimes leading to gangrene.	3.3102266916860215
The case of a 75 year old woman is presented who was suffering from migraine-attacks since adolescence.	3.5071743912075197
Due to longterm use of ergotamine containing suppositories she developed perianal ulcers.	2.7854664460364575
After withdrawl of the drug the ulcers healed up entirely.	3.6137935602469766
The spectrum of ergotamine-induced side-effects and possible intervention strategies are discussed.	3.237031127139607
In this article, a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed, which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians.	3.614872764157772
This model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help.	4.045242068051065
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance has three elements: (1.)	2.4823253349304526
a QA-Inventory for routine monitoring; (2.)	3.4442391536944292
rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and (3.)	5.055455236890194
a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists (quality circles).	3.379546944496898
The focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results.	3.6799497148887883
It is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles, where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed.	3.9055629368874505
This feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients.	3.631607612553374
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of Quality Assurance, which is aimed at assuring and improving the quality and rationality of the psychotherapeutic service.	3.3460670917249073
Aims: In this study the technique of intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) was evaluated as an experimental tool to differentiate peripheral and central effects of analgesics.	3.876933068814502
A pre-term infant weighing 900 g, gestational age 25 weeks, developed an acute abdomen.	3.344846582135907
Intravenous lines had been inserted previously in the left (silasticcatheter) and right (24 G cannula) saphenous veins in the neonatal intensive care unit.	3.1848008121122238
During surgical exploration, a perforation of the terminal ileum was found.	3.1452451882737966
The operation consisted in partial resection of the perforated ileum with an end-to-end anastomosis and a double-lumen colostomy.	3.122779627740098
Major blood loss during the procedure caused serious haemodynamic problems.	3.525944509526027
Despite transfusion of erythrocyte (100 ml), thrombocytes (75 ml), and albumin (50 ml), the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension.	4.646231450846937
Administration of atropine, adrenaline, and calcium IV had no effect.	2.9003449986682956
The operation could be finished only with extrathoracic resuscitation.	2.9214396190028005
When the drapes were removed, livid, swollen lower limbs raised the suspicion of an acute thrombosis of the inferior vena cava.	3.2456268521246234
After insertion of a 24 G IV cannula into a vein of the right upper arm, the circulation stabilised after rapid transfusion of 40 ml blood and 25 ml thrombocytes and resuscitation was successful.	3.3403418773586573
Paediatricians and anaesthesiologists must consider the risk of thrombosis of the vena cava.	4.582701998481881
If venous lines in the lower limbs are not visible to the anaesthesiologist during the operation, venipuncture of veins of an upper limb is recommended before starting the surgical procedure.	3.7197055785629103
Due to the high incidence of vena cava thrombosis caused by central venous lines and the difficulty of peripheral venipuncture in pre-termintanty, a safe venous line should be inserted if necessary by pre-operative venesection.	3.0253109068355495
While complementary medicine and homeopathy is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the health care practices, there is a lack of controlled studies concerning their effectiveness.	3.8499451660589297
In our study, we wanted to answer the question whether a combination of Formica rufa D6 and reinjection of the patient's own blood is superior to injection of placebo.	3.230876891991059
104 patients with ankylosing spondylitis entered a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.	3.165733774485788
During four weeks they received twice weekly either 1 ml of Formica rufa D6 in combination with 0.5 ml of blood or 1.5 ml NaCl intramuscular.	3.214212580225073
Before and after therapy, mobility, thoracic excursion and doctor's overall assessment were measured in addition to patient's health status, using a German version of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales, before and after therapy as well as four, twelve, and twentyfour weeks later.	3.6598730589780097
We were not able to detect any statistical difference between treatment and placebo group in any of the parameters measured.	3.466753645478473
Therefore, the therapy under study may not be regarded effective.	3.259159779561877
While urinating at the side of the road he felt an erection.	3.2477775792927877
He approached a 9-year-old girl who happened to be coming along and pressed his penis between her legs until ejaculation.	2.841424033520589
Shortly afterwards he was arrested.	3.3945546457931335
He confessed, but claimed partial amnesia and had no explanation for the offence, which he normally would never have thought of.	3.1039651306843203
Shortly before the event a witness had seen him nearby in a poor state of orientation.	2.981207691245846
Three months later in prison he suffered massive subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.	3.5056616282149164
The evaluation of his legal responsibility must take account of a putative psychomotor seizure at the time of the offence.	3.141798473869818
With regard to the aneurysm diagnosed later, a pathogenetic connection, in terms of a preceding warning leak, might be assumed.	3.2165469201102463
We present a 43-year-old patient who has had up to 15 frontal lobe seizures nightly for 12 years.	2.8837180526243205
The patient had no complaints apart from excessive daytime sleepiness.	2.6166947904843125
Neurological and psychiatric examination as well as cerebral computed tomograph and magnetic resonance imaging were normal.	4.242207182640499
After sleep deprivation an interictal electro-encephalogram demonstrated a recurrent excess of theta activity over the right frontal and frontopolar area.	2.7304854141372
A cerebral PET study showed diminished glucose metabolism of the right cingular and frontomesial region.	3.528130067568535
The sleep structure was extremely fragmented.	3.3019947595462145
There was an excessive reduction of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep.	2.8508502654270984
Carbamazepine therapy produced complete seizure control lasting a few weeks, followed by return of up to 8 seizures per night.	3.594135702251504
Vigabatrin as add on therapy diminished the noctural seizures to 1 to 3 per night.	3.088701731549389
Introduction: We attempted to optimize the determination of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation in VLBW infants for practical use in a tertiary care center.	3.237929937990137
The influence of measuring conditions upon results as well as of caloric intake and food composition on substrate utilisation and growth were investigated.	3.127693720776906
We report a truck driver with severe soft tissue contusion of both legs who developed atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) after a thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin; despite a thrombosis the patient showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin in combination with elevation of thrombocytes and positive heparin-dependent antibodies.	3.156267600285366
Six days after the initial trauma deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and fasciotomy was performed, preventing an imminent compartment syndrome.	4.26178034612792
Another 5 days later the patient developed exanthema of the trunk and upper extremities and urticaria on his face, as well as severe headache.	4.238654801382464
His platelet count increased from 134 000/µl to 258 000/µl.	3.07126985459165
After exclusion of other causes for these symptoms, a reaction to heparin-dependent antibodies (heparin-platelet-factor 4 complex) was demonstrated 2 days later.	3.395111400503306
Thrombosis prophylaxis was changed to hirudin (Refludan) and elevation of thrombocytes to 445 000/µl was noted.	3.1031117480747494
Shortly after rinsing of an intravenous line with less than 50 IE unfractionated heparin at day 36 after trauma the patient developed an anaphylactic shock, which could be managed with cortisone.	3.2747777997341703
We suggest that in HIT the thrombocytopenia may represent only one form of an allergic reaction to heparin.	3.033228523826502
The cause of the thrombembolic event is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin taking place on the surface of the thrombocyte.	3.4181600593422004
This is similar in all forms of systemic reaction to heparin application, even though the symptoms may vary.	3.719135407801077
As thrombocytopenia may not be the main symptom of a heparin-induced antibody reaction - in our hospital only 5 of 10 patients with HIT - the disease should rather be named "heparin allergy".	3.845503195827813
We suggest a new classification of different pattern of heparin allergy types I-IV.	3.5655677289080523
The new types I and II are similar to HIT types I and II.	3.1318096569216416
Type III is the reaction of antibodies without decrease of thrombocytes, and type IV the reaction of antibodies associated with systemic allergic symptoms.	3.012849488544387
In recent years, lengthening the human mandible by distraction osteogenesis has become an accepted treatment to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia.	2.849422097695454
Using intraoral unidirectional and extraoral bidirectional distraction devices we report about our experiences and results in the application of the bone distraction technique in four selected cases of syndromal disease, including various forms of mandibular hypoplastic malformations.	3.840503899813423
The patients involved were a boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, a girl with unilateral facial hypoplasia in Goldenhar's syndrome, a case with Nager's syndrome, and a rare case of midline deficiency caused by partial deletion of chromosome 18 (18p-syndrome).	3.4581463031080224
The distraction period lasted from 6 to 30 days and new bone formation, ranging from 6 to 28 mm, was achieved.	3.6826320949571882
Real leg length discrepancies may be cosmetically disturbing and lead to gait abnormalities, pelvic obliquity with subsequent lumbar scoliosis as well as functional disturbances of hip, knee and ankle joint.	3.5062570551506873
Morbidity and mortality after reversal of Hartmann's procedure following perforated sigmoid diverticulitis are high and the rate of intestinal restoration is low.	3.1422865573173007
Aim: To investigate whether laparoscopically assisted reversal of Hartmann's procedure is technically feasible and whether the laparoscopic procedure offers any benefit to the patient.	3.177137643211842
Method: Nineteen patients were investigated.	3.915399672924791
The postoperative course was followed prospectively.	3.1921173147773914
All patients were reinvestigated 9 months after surgery.	2.990676142160963
Results: Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure was attempted in 19 patients.	3.132105528397435
One patient did not want the laparoscopic technique.	3.069880021186861
In two cases (11 %) conversion to the conventional technique was necessary; thus, 16 patients were operated laparoscopically.	3.8434630805777217
Median operative time was 114 (65-180) min.	3.6161666569128723
With the exception of three wound infections no immediate postoperative complications were noticed.	2.9096650886174444
Patients' convalescence was fast.	3.128718632845737
First evacuation took place 3.3 (3-5) days after surgery, complete oral nutrition 3.6 (3-5) days after surgery.	3.357383979206614
Duration of postoperative hospitalisation was 7.5 (5-12) days.	3.948863633275935
One patient developed later a clinically significant anastomotic stricture which needed endoscopic dilatation.	2.7775030202584383
Conclusion: Laparoscopically assisted Hartmann's reversal is technically demanding but feasible.	3.1674314597856004
Postoperative morbidity is low, duration of hospitalisation short, convalescence fast.	3.54210473610387
Thus, good arguments exist for performing reversal of Hartmann's procedures laparoscopically.	3.0930174524355722
Mechanical ventilation is a well-etablished strategy in intensive care medicine.	3.229547562239938
The weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome, showing tachycardia, hypertonia, tachypnea and restlessness.	3.161524370259461
Although treatment with clonidine can influence these symptoms, tachypnea still remains the main problem in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.	3.3182534530405814
Adding sufentanil, an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl, tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency.	3.3812118483706
In this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both, the patient and physician.	3.9008575918736415
In comparison with a group of 50 patients treated with clonidine alone, 72 patients treated with clonidine/sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation (4.8 vs 7.6 days) and until discharge from the ICU (7.7 vs 12.4 days).	3.3680776058441
The number of reintubations caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from 16.0 to 2.8 %.	2.5737329615743647
Background: With regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues, microsurgical techniques, HLA typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection, and postoperative treatment schedules have been improved in recent years.	3.050650171789572
This now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed.	3.141740742129485
However, in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear.	3.200544247280449
The occurrence of a new influenza virus subtype in 1997 in Hongkong caused only minor outbreaks due to the swift and determined actions of the institutions involved.	3.2540677939026446
However, this incident again made it clear that an influenza pandemic is still a pending threat.	3.0077335262632134
As a result the WHO presented a pandemic preparedness plan which is to facilitate the global measures taken to fight an imminent or ongoing pandemic.	2.862260996189394
Strong efforts of influenza surveillance and the coordination of worldwide measures are essential to this plan.	3.189319808279387
Furthermore the WHO suggested the developement and introduction of similar national preparedness plans.	2.930098293258133
Given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock, immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy.	3.5842027295958316
Many agents have been studied that have the therapeutic potential to interfere with cytokines and other pathways which are activated during sepsis.	3.2842768086871605
Drugs having the properties to neutralize lipopolysaccharides have also been considered.	3.331550683412692
So far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents (HA1A, E5, anti TNF antibodies, ILra) have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit.	3.4554653595531692
In certain trials results were indecisive, or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies.	3.0485947945562435
In certain other trials, like those on antibodies against TNF, some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients.	3.314677803819579
Thus, new trials are on their ways.	3.254820750197885
So far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re-examine the concept of immunomodulation, and to redefine strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host, while not putting him at risk.	3.462597901391297
Recently, percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) has become more frequent, since the technique can be mastered relatively easily.	3.66592040712071
PDT is neither time-consuming nor does it require much personell or material.	3.189966836975461
Our study seeks to evaluate PDT in terms of its effectivness and practicality on a cardio-surgical ICU.	2.80523675996017
Recently, two new halogenated volatile anaesthetics, sevoflurane and desflurane, have been approved for clinical use in Germany.	3.5670387628803275
Their low solubility in blood is the most important common property, and this represents the most obvious difference from the inhalational anaesthetics currently used.	3.875135885879868
Extensive clinical and experimental evaluations have confirmed the superior pharmacokinetic properties predicted.	3.288519522561407
Both sevoflurane and desflurane provide more rapid emergence from anaesthesia, permit easier titration of the anaesthetic dose during maintenance and offer more rapid recovery from anaesthesia.	2.957426062390022
For sevoflurane, there are additional advantages: a pleasant odor, negligible airway irritation, and excellent pharmacodynamic characteristics that even provide cardiovascular stability comparable to isoflurane.	3.113594800243682
A certain disadvantage and source of potential nephrotoxicity result from the metabolism of sevoflurane (2-5%) to anorganic fluoride and degradation to compound A in carbon dioxide absorbents.	3.204515922269642
The extensive clinical data reported to date have revealed no evidence that sevoflurane has adverse renal effects.	3.663143139093646
New insight into the pathomechanism of nephrotoxicity associated with either production of fluoride or compound A may well support clinical experience.	2.9888385981970598
Desflurane strongly resists in vivo metabolism and because of this it appears to be devoid of toxicity.	3.50129886606334
Nevertheless, potential side-effects may result from degradation in dry absorbents and subsequent release of CO, from its extreme pungency and irritating airway effects.	3.086969347933326
Thus, desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia, especially in children.	4.384425125569202
The tendency for desflurane transiently to stimulate sympathetic activity, especially at concentrations above 1.0 MAC, limits its application in patients with cardiac disease.	3.6112517847705816
The doctor in charge, who is generally the medical director, is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational faults within his or her department.	3.000511425364893
Even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible - that is to say the medical director - to be liable.	3.192862470691451
For this reason, the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training.	3.2533914237507457
Every training measure must guarantee specialist standards; this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist.	3.663486926030294
A legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times.	4.149427624014863
Operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist; otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization.	3.1137379768363482
Because of staff shortages it often happens that inexperienced beginners - often doctors doing their practical training - are on call very early on.	2.7241730674869653
In the high-risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times.	3.2203731126326676
The changeover from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are rested and that adequate free time is guaranteed.	3.096312093985105
Each sector must know its own area of responsibility.	3.1288515172346525
The doctor in charge is resonsible for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment.	3.2706099043766765
Uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his/her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects.	3.38107539655946
Georg Friedrich Stromeyer (1804- 1876) is generally known as one of the founders of orthopedics and orthopedic surgery and also made many contributions to modern military medicine.	2.9496611019013073
Furthermore, every oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Germany knows him because of the "Stromeyer hook", which is used for elevation of zygomatic arch fractures.	3.8805792735046545
This special aspect as well as Stromeyer's biography is presented in this article from the history of medicine.	3.658777148100573
Changes in clinical presentation of Crohn's disease (CD), patients' age at the time of disease manifestation and operation, general condition and duration of medical management were investigated in a retrospective study.	3.7216708618247045
395 operations for CD were divided into consecutive groups and analysed.	3.61385271212708
Patients in later groups were younger and in better general condition.	3.0444721167765967
We found a rise in frequency of patients with recurrent CD or prior abdominal surgery for other reasons.	3.4780448158408857
Primary surgery for CD increasingly consisted of resection of solitary segments of gut; in the case of recurrence, of multiple, minimal resections.	3.7052883434827093
The average total length of the resected intestine could be significantly reduced.	3.54730184961886
The complication rate was equal in elective and emergency surgery.	2.781730622351847
Even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity.	3.595466059474733
Etiologically, numerous factors must be taken into account, the most significant one being arteriosclerosis.	3.9458704310433728
The clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous.	3.0863315465533696
CT and, above all, intra-arterial DSA allow for a diagnosis.	3.502366368417108
A generous consideration of indicating operative intervention, even in asymptomatic patients, is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture.	3.7512040134795885
The preferrable therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or endovascularly by embolization.	3.2521141842498165
In the future a treatment with coated stents (TPEG) would also seem possible.	2.9713609123031848
Special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation.	3.1719309013745445
We report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion.	3.2112064910224203
Background: Clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamylphosphate-synthetase (4), argininosuccinate-synthetase (2) and argininosuccinate-lyase (2) ) are described.	3.6660547385315305
Methods/Therapy: Emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i. v. as well as peritoneal dialysis and/or modified hemodialysis.	3.828035751701949
Chronic treatment comprised a low-protein diet and substitution of essential amino acids, of benzoate or phenylbutyrate and of branched-chain amino acids.	2.9261972392514912
Results: Within 72 hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed, leading to developmental retardation later in life.	3.1607508767728674
Four patients died between 2 weeks and 4 years of age.	3.500687598450149
During follow-up, all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively.	3.0168894563574598
Phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side-effects than benzoate, branched-chain amino acids had favourable effects.	2.933700076029421
One patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development.	3.62204914769057
Conclusions: Neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder.	2.955949806111948
Specific therapy as described can be life-saving, although most children exhibit marked developmental delay.	3.1240314282291672
Sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side-effects than sodium benzoate.	3.6252285701245004
Therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications.	3.42589566510837
Pronounced osteoporosis of and surrounding the acetabulum commonly leads to early loosening of endoprosthetic hip replacements following implantation.	2.981458535049466
Large osseous defects in the subimplant bed are the result and the reason why multiple revisions of loosened acetabular cups have to be performed so often in rheumatic surgery.	3.4176965178532273
The defects extend from the cranial to the central; ventral and dorsal anchorage losses may occur in addition to this.	3.8437763135729206
The anchorage of a new implant must be adapted to the individual circumstances.	3.7347193488508097
The new implant must be selected in accordance with point of surgical access, the patient's general status and osseous regenerationability.	3.4769608471426934
In the optimum case, osseous buildup of lost anatomical structures is the preferred method.	2.9936573391457753
If this is not possible, special implants, mostly custom-made prostheses, have to be incorporated.	3.917575475942821
However, the survival time of the implants is much shorter than in patients with degenerative diseases.	4.958282722356428
In patients with progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD) invasive electrophysiologic studies can detect hidden intracardiac conduction disturbances.	2.852335066852374
The aim of this study was a long-term follow-up of these patients.	3.06989790921379
Twelve consecutive patients (9m, 3f, age 28 +/- 4 yrs) without cardiac symptoms and with normal echocardiographic findings were included in the study.	3.4357763498085485
They suffered from different stages of PMD type Erb (n=4), Becker-Kiener (n=4), Duchenne (n=2) and Landouzy-Déjerine (n=2).	3.1829713923641023
At the beginning of the study all patients underwent an invasive electrophysiologic study (EPS).	3.317250122795099
The follow-up of 5.5 yrs included regular clinical visits, ECGs, and Holter recordings (every 3 months) as well as an echocardiography every 6 months.	3.167263894990151
In 4 patients the EPS revealed a hidden interatrial conduction disturbance (AHRS-ACS 120 +/- 18ms), and in 10 pts an infrahisian conduction disturbance was found (HV max.	3.2205277875963354
Conduction defects were seen independently from the type of PMD and the stage of the disease.	3.457763480624647
During the follow-up the initially hidden interatrial conduction disturbance became evident in the surface ECG in 2 of 4 pts.	3.5627649355551534
One of them developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.	3.0095709307885903
Five of 10 pts with an initially hidden infrahisian conduction disturbance developed an AV block grade I-III and in one case additionally a bundle branch block.	3.516609353066054
Four of these pts - whose PMD showed progression or who developed congestive cardiomyopathy - needed pacemaker implantation because of a first-degree AV block + bifascicular bundle branch block (n=1), a Mobitz II second-degree AV block (n=1) or a third-degree AV block (n=2).	3.1563044326663663
None of the pts with normal findings at the EPS showed abnormal p-waves, an AV block, or an intraventricular conduction disturbance during the follow-up.	2.88077422170324
We conclude that intracardiac conduction disturbances, especially infrahisian defects including high-degree AV blocks, are a common finding in pts with PMD.	3.297448442298362
Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core temperature below 35 °C and is caused by exposure to cold, drugs, endocrine dysfunction, central nervous system disorders, skin disorders, and trauma.	3.3829508681737903
Bone is among the most common sites of metastatic disease in cancers of the breast, prostate, and lung.	3.8691274725412677
The decision about systemic therapy depends on the histology, presence and extent of extraskeletal disease, and the performance status of the patient.	4.112325499993541
In estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, and for patients who have failed hormonal therapy or have liver metastases, chemotherapy should be initiated.	4.30001896266062
All patients with small-cell lung cancer should receive chemotherapy.	2.9623978704768223
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers can be treated with radioisotopes.	3.689325156575139
In non-small-cell lung cancer or renal cell cancer, systemic chemotherapy should be confined to younger patients and patients in good general condition.	3.300460429365127
Radiologic assessment of responses of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult.	3.892656067438462
New approaches in measuring bone metabolites in urine might prove helpful.	3.175095682931409
Although most prenatally diagnosed anatomic malformations are best managed after birth, we can presently offer prenatal therapy to an increasing number of fetuses with simple anatomical defects that have predictably devastating developmental consequences.	3.0148143724966543
A condition amenable to prenatal intervention must fulfill a number of conditions.	3.4754688650019334
It must be severe enough to warrant the risks associated with in utero treatment and must be reliably detectable before birth.	3.008905094401508
Furthermore, the pathophysiology must be reversible by fetal intervention, significantly improving the prognosis over postnatal treatment.	2.7900968038035585
Current indication for prenatal intervention include decompression for obstructive uropathy, temporary tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and tumor debulking for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung and sacrococcygeal teratoma.	3.143553228625331
Prenatal repair of myelomeningocele is currently being developed but remains controversial since this is not a lethal malformation.	3.613322483873305
Maternal safety remains paramount in considering fetal intervention.	3.0778320624668534
The main associated risks are pre-term labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes.	2.9108102822508535
To reduce maternal morbidity and the risk of prematurity, minimally invasive fetoscopic techniques were developed and are increasingly employed.	3.7590836152524965
These developments will in all probability reduce the importance of open fetal surgery in the future.	3.790196957227186
In Germany a significant increase of nosocomial infections due to MRSA has occurred during the last 10 years.	3.50180983537994
Especially elderly patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of becoming colonized or infected with MRSA.	3.9109416318717867
This report focuses on epidemiology and therapy of MRSA, and on the recommendations concerning management and prevention of spread of MRSA in hospitals and nursing homes.	3.5644756031626024
During general anaesthesia gas climate significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques.	3.0863152640423364
Gas climatisation, however, markedly also will be influenced by the temperature loss at, and corresponding water condensation within the hoses, factors which are related to the technical design and material of the patient hose system.	4.011813633317788
The objective of this prospective study was to investigate 1. how anaesthetic gas climatisation during minimal flow anaesthesia is influenced by the technical design of different breathing hose systems in clinical practice.	3.17330472019318
2. to investigate, whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used, proven beforehand to optimally warming and humidifying the anaesthetic gases.	3.079835499366335
Introduction: Undifferentiated, embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver, the incidence of which is highest in children between 6 and 10 years of age (14.1 %).	4.495633905612888
Among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia.	3.207756097144746
Embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults.	3.391664874994922
To our knowledge, only 18 cases have been published in the last 50 years.	3.9456990425114364
Methods and results: We now present the case of a 29-year-old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma.	3.5027097503705895
Conclusion: This case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver.	4.1246174964103695
The management of this case comprised primary tamponade, interventional embolisation of the feeding artery, and secondary resection under stable conditions.	3.234725764444957
Substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders, which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy.	4.0575753299822095
However reasons are discussed, why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients.	3.507503357027175
Insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency, structural problems, expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in healthprofessionals' perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves.	3.186832747570675
Though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes exhausting, the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing.	3.0174039216189414
Readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients.	3.611925450187476
They are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude.	3.5434725990254456
They can be easily implemented in different settings.	3.2101723184546906
At the end of the first part of this review in- patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined.	3.7510414153244063
This will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches.	3.5525908196678726
The following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability.	3.592742344677288
A model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis.	3.9031706976847955
The concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive.	3.2782315218829114
Four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO), our preferred method of treatment of unstable Colles fracture.	3.517020701786988
Biocompatible osteosynthesis was achieved with an invasivity and stability comparable to that of KWO.	3.8249263692481588
In conclusion, injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects.	2.8008989688936743
Regarding the recent developments in injectable materials for osteosynthesis it offers the best perspective for clinical application.	3.048682786927048
The "pain in the lower limbs" (growing pain) represent one of the most frequent complaint pictures in the child orthopaedic consulting hour.	3.5046855627607005
The delimitation compared to other diseases is difficult and laborious on account of many differential diagnoses.	3.4151305956040745
Destination of our investigations was it to set up a standardized investigation diagram with recording all differential diagnoses.	3.069138148556926
In psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the 'talking cure' because they tend to act instead of verbalizing their experiences interactive entanglements are rather common.	2.9360650818840157
Often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat.	3.1327030605206105
The symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then.	3.0534967934735224
Gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of 'body language' suggests.	2.9897888404825728
Instead as permanent concomitant of utterances it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist.	3.2352023615952152
The surgical treatment of varicous veins demands complete exclusion of the primary recirculation circuit.	3.369799058673685
The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms, on i.e.	3.2431650695316914
If there is saphenous vein agreement between them, phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation.	2.995451993983076
The prospective comparative examination of non-invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12% of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3% for the small with a correction of the operative procedure.	3.9181660972214725
In 10 cases of incomplete trunk varicosis, only one diagnosis was correct with non-invasive measures.	3.7578231717327686
This leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms.	4.239633336851066
Undislocated odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x-rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability.	3.7174015951235173
Therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism.	3.5534600250492154
In this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction.	3.205402007412507
Furthermore a better classification of densfractures will be recommended.	3.049170825370905
In a period of 4 years between March 1994 and March 1998, 143 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery.	3.0650775744473866
According to manometric studies 76 patients had a short-floppy Nissen fundoplication, patients with impaired motility or paraesophageal hernias received a hemifundoplication (Toupet = 42, Dor/Thal = 25).	3.057020674210645
Recurrent reflux symptoms appeared in 6,3 % after mean 16,7 months follow-up (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 24 %, P < 0.01).	2.7825309729974945
Persistent dysphagia with reoperation occurred in 2.1 % (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 0 %, n. s.).	2.199095682406608
The assessment of Visick's score at the latest control showed the following: Visick I = 63.6 %, Visick II = 30.1 %, Visick III = 6.3 %, Visick IV = 0 %.	2.6804833452459333
The outcome of the operation was rated "excellent" or "good" by 91.6 % of the patients.	3.504364576905351
In contrast to auditory brainstem potentials (ABR), a more apically defined generation of middle latency evoked potentials (MLR) can be assumed due to the longer integration time present.	3.929067404438629
To date, the effect of stimulus frequency spectra on MLR has not been completely known.	3.4307492176095296
By using masking with high-pass filtered white noise in 12 normal-hearing adults, we measured the dependence of amplitude and latency of ABR and MLR on filter frequency.	3.043152978335187
No differences were found between the masking effects for ABR and MLR evoked by tone bursts of 0.5 and 2 kHz.	3.003558254744296
The high-pass masking of click stimuli showed a greater influence on the amplitude and latency of the ABR than on MLR.	3.426524803741298
These different qualities have to be considered clinically when evaluating the methods and results of hearing testing with acoustic evoked potentials.	3.576248322068453
Our findings show that MLR evoked by tone bursts should be used for the frequency selective diagnosis of hearing thresholds, especially in low- frequency ranges.	3.646731074035223
Objectives: To clarify the incidence of sudden arrythmic death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx).	3.3988971566586472
Background: Some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long-term success of the operation.	4.007886019000944
Incidence, underlying risk factors, etiologies, and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined.	3.4351544330706276
Methods: Retrospective analysis of our cohort of 120 cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of 142HTx patients of the years 1984-1999.	3.6155483497611174
Clinical events (death, mode of death, Re-HTx, resuscitation) were noted and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and related to the patients' characteristics by multivariate analysis.	3.600177026937673
Sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or unwittnessed death.	3.585657742547167
Clinical and postmortem findings (autopsies are available in 12/18 sudden death patients) were correlated to the mode of death.	3.6424854282600325
Results: During a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 +/- 3.5 years, 45 patients died (38%).	3.9372444086727785
The mode of death was non-sudden in 27 inpatients.	3.6147691823574553
18 deaths were sudden, 14 of these out of hospital.	3.476702900074895
In addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations, one of those patients died three month later suddenly, giving a number of a total of 21 cardiac arrests in 20HTx patients.	3.582268317884122
The actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20% after 6 and 40% after 12 years.	3.441601402720182
Based on postmortem analysis the etiologies of the events were attributed to transplant vasculopathy in 15 patients, rejection in 5 patients (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade >3A), and to unknown reasons in one.	3.5241740275597095
All three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented bradycardic events (2xtotal AV block, 1xsinus arrest).	2.6723625691528903
Pacemakers were implanted in these patients.	3.642975993887696
One of those died suddenly 2 months later.	3.199659092960479
Significantly more HTx patients dying suddenly are smokers, had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and worse hemodynamics.	2.998937521537228
QRS width and PR interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest.	3.867093094849019
Conclusions: Sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after HTx.	3.3505470838551137
As HTx patient numbers are rising constantly, sudden cardiac death in this population will represent a significant problem.	3.4166476746543863
In our patients about 75% of the arrests can be attributed to graft-vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection.	3.131904886403768
Interestingly, some events may be caused from bradyarrhythmic rhythm disturbances.	3.350369627154075
Introduction: Traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee.	4.3558878062974875
The indications for operative and conservative treatment are still controversial.	3.0774478110500203
Methods and results: From 1974 to 1994, 38 patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department.	3.0874579267265676
Thirty-four of these patients were followed up for 3-16 years (mean: 8.6 years).	3.545042980018475
In 29 cases of the follow-up group, reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments was performed.	3.694375225164156
In the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone.	3.0614822902930405
At the time of follow-up, 90 % of the patients showed good knee stability, but 90 % had lack of motion as well.	3.5855403339886722
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis was mostly mild to moderate.	2.969070096589314
Thirty-five percents of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the Lysholm Score.	4.05326612891867
Conclusions: Positive prognostic factors were an age less than 40 years at the time of the accident, a low-energy trauma, e. g., a sports-related injury, early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments, and initial postoperative functional treatment.	3.607457456056421
Huntington's disease (HD) is member of a growing family of neurodegenerative diseases which are caused by a CAG-Triplet expansion in the coding region of their respective genes.	3.0008197262252354
The results of the research of the last years is very suggestive of a common pathomechanisms of all these diseases even though their clinical appearance may be quite different.	3.418740643208418
The development of new animal models by transferring the human gene defect into the mouse genome has led to the finding of so-called intranuclear inclusion bodies.	3.2398825532973867
This new observation allowed to come closer to solving the problem how this genetic defect causes neurodegeneration.	2.8368827939395986
Recent studies on transgenic HD mice could also demonstrate a possible connection between the genetic defect and glutamate exitotoxicity in the neurodegenerative process of HD which had been emphasized by earlier animal models of the disease.	2.9657473416056392
Transgenic animal models of HD will have an important impact on the understanding of the disease mechanisms and may contribute to a faster development and testing of new therapeutic approaches.	4.6538458218991545
Background: The Whipple operation (PD) is the standard operation in patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region.	4.525667207440826
However, the pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy (PPPD) is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function.	3.169653321401234
Methods: In a prospective randomized trial (October 1994-October 1998) PD and PPPD were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life, operation time, duration of hospital stay, transfusions and perioperative morbidity.	3.5060905930803097
Quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions (EORTC-QLQ-30) pre- and postoperatively (weeks 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60).	3.1022864348119286
Results: A duodenopancreatectomy was performed in 48 patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas (n = 38) and the periampullary region (n = 10) (PD, n = 24; PPPD, n = 24).	4.058239975508089
The PD and PPPD groups did not differ according to age, gender or UICC stage.	3.4705208219746555
Operation time was shorter in the PPPD group (206  +/-  48 vs 306  +/-  54 min) (P < 0.05).	2.9804215634286524
Morbidity did not differ between the two groups (PPPD 20 % vs PD 30 %, P > 0.05).	3.242512847906134
While there was no difference in global quality of life, gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the PPPD group regarding appetite, nausea and diarrhea (P < 0.05).	3.508152425811141
While the preoperative body weight was reached after 6 months in 85 % of the PPPD group (n = 20), this was true in only 60 % of the PD-group (n = 14) (P < 0.05).	3.821724285058187
Conclusion: PPPD seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than PD.	4.345105368641495
Oxygen uptake (V.O2) and carbon dioxide elimination (V.CO2) can be measured with an indirect calorimeter; this method is well established in routine monitoring of ICU patients to evaluate metabolic state as a reflection of stress.	3.469706727079283
In various experimental studies it was demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole-body metabolism.	3.231070494801629
The purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable changes in metabolism can be detected immediately.	3.0691560925030736
Abdominal aortic cross-clamping changes circulation, nutritional supply of the lower extremities and thus V.O2 and V.CO2.	3.7299019351326668
We therefore used this operation for our study.	3.2954161846674994
For certain indications, anterior fusion of the lumbar spine is a standard operation.	4.265144812915642
The surgeon specializing in operations on the vertebral column must leam to utilize the advantages of laparoscopic surgery.	3.1837653463406594
However, an absolute must before applying the technique to humans is adequate training in its use in living animals.	3.031417363343533
For this purpose, the pig is a highly suitable model.	2.9893235999823684
The surgical team comprises a surgeon experienced in spinal procedures, an abdominal surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic surgery and an experienced cameraman.	3.186732845919342
In the animal model, a change in position - organ preparation from the cranial direction, a suprasymphysial approach to the vertebrae - has proved expedient.	3.2848772622767872
Operational interventions can be planned and simulated accurately with the help of a three-dimensional reconstruction of the anatomical bone structures, created from the tomographic data of a patient.	3.9603791616766233
Computer-assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can assist the intraoperative realization of the planned intervention and may support the spatial orientation within the operational field.	2.9744876827583586
The desmoplastic type of the squamous cell carcinoma (DSCC) of the skin is an entity which is readily distinguished by light microscopy.	4.159391832618924
The DSCC has fine branches surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma and shows in some cases typical perineural, perivascular and widespread intradermal invasion (maximum 6 cm!).	2.8223766677664295
This type accounts for 8.2% (n=44) of our collective of 594 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the skin and vermilion border.	3.2910642273656023
Clinically DSCC look like other malignant epithelial tumors of the skin.	3.835688024269167
All tumors were followed up for at least 3 years (maximum 10 years).	3.2397312250924997
The local recurrence rate was high (24.3%) even though micrographic surgery was carried out.	3.2938555402735137
The rate of local or regional metastasis was also very high (22.7%).	3.11734620050553
In comparison the recurrence rate and the rate of metatasis of the remaining common 91.8% SCC's (n=550) was low: 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively.	3.3480124388497123
The DSCC is best treated with micrographic surgery and wider safety margins than any other type and should be followed up very frequently.	3.4893623157228304
In the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness.	3.1776832245869087
The interaction between the patient with ALS and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication, especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support.	3.9899128690333123
The patient and his family must be informed thoroughly about the natural history and the prognosis of ALS, depending on the individual disease process.	3.791709288499743
Already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled.	4.091462529897541
If ALS patients are not informed about the acute respiratory insufficiency they run the risk of having to be intubated and mechanically ventilated over a long term.	3.836832875229199
Background: The advent of multidetector CT (MDCT) constitutes a quantum leap creating a wealth of new opportunities in medical imaging.	2.822613012929218
However, while the basic principles of spiral CT still apply, we are now challenged to rethink our strategies in planning a CT study to take full advantage of the increased capabilities of MDCT.	3.475209212165845
Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP), a therapeutic modality that has been under investigation for some years, is based on separation of a leucocyte/lymphocyte-enriched cell fraction from the peripheral blood, extracorporeal treatment of the cells with 8-MOP/UVA and subsequent reinfusion of the cells in the patient.	3.95289449305961
Its main effects seem to consist in changes to the immunologic behaviour of the photoinactivated/modulated cells.	3.045364843355658
The immune response of the host is obviously stimulated by this treatment.	3.5024961827024383
The treatment is well tolerated and causes few side effects.	3.1693537550697455
In our department, 1210 ECP treatments were administered to 41 patients between 1990 and 1994 and a preliminary evaluation was performed.	3.0822970792528253
These patients included 21 with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 10 with progressive systemic scleroderma, 4 with chronic graft-versus-host disease and 1 each with pemphigus vulgaris, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, lupus erythematosus and cutaneous mucinosis.	2.7522413234218477
Patients with erythroderma and preserved immunocompetence achieved the best responses of all patients with CTCL.	3.6951507507071493
A treatment combining ECP with rlFN-, PUVA and/or radiation was also successful in patients with tumour-stage CTCL and lymph node involvement.	3.7197822886076954
Progressive systemic scleroderma responded in more than 50% of our cases.	3.4869274510713666
Treatment results were impressive in 4 patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease presenting with sclerodermatous and lichenoid changes of the skin and mucous membranes.	3.6413410168909284
A clear improvement was also observed in the patient with pemphigus vulgaris refractory to standard therapies and in another patient with scleromyxoedema (Arndt-Gottron syndrome).	3.642036180880467
The effectiveness of ECP seems to be quite well established in CTCL, but remains to be examined in autoimmune dermatoses.	3.581078558747717
ECP is an attractive addition to the dermatological therapies available but our experience is still preliminary.	3.6891701327189677
Opportunistic infections after long-term treatment with azathioprine (AZA) have not been noted in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).	4.3090622699100045
We report on a 56-year-old woman with generalized MG who presented with cytomegalovirus infection after being treated with AZA for 17 years.	2.6844169175789836
The indication for immunosuppressive treatment in MG should be regularly reconfirmed, particularly since at least 50% of patients can discontinue AZA after two to four years without risk of exacerbation.	2.982068553328207
Failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem.	3.46411658038268
Although ultrasonography has 95 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to erroneous interpretation.	3.3854191772603635
We report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal colic and ultrasonographically confirmed cholecystolithiasis.	2.7727742584973734
During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the gallbladder could not be detected.	3.691707170116946
After laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography, agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed.	3.116664567922745
This method can be considered for diagnosis of gallbladder agenesis without the need for laparotomy and thorough exploration.	3.6185215403846103
Right colon diverticulitis, representing 1-3,6 % of cases of diverticular disease is an uncommon cause of right lower quadrant pain.	4.049801093224549
Its presentation is difficult to distinguish from acute appendicitis.	3.9723322554434604
Patients are between 35 and 50 years old, have a history of 2-3 days of abdominal pain and few gastrointestinal symptoms.	4.411243250126914
The diagnosis is best confirmed by computed tomography and colonoscopy.	3.1710918944923128
Conservative treatment is justified in uncomplicated disease, whereas perforations, abcesses and inflammatory tumors require resection.	2.924531731033024
We describe the cases of six patients treated at our institution from 1991 to 1996.	3.738534147781151
Presentation, geographic variations, diagnostic procedures and management are discussed.	3.2813657648155377
Malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis in both clinical and histologic examination of melanocytic nevi.	4.3224880699101975
UV exposure with an erythemagenic dose and mechanical irritation of melanocytic nevi are able to induce reversible morphologic changes which simulate malignant melanoma.	3.080120186193626
These changes are associated with an increased expression of HMB-45 antigen.	3.3562661064062875
In addition, an increased proliferation and repair activity is observed after UV exposure.	3.158916265289754
The increased number of melanocytes located in suprabasal layers of the epidermis is accompanied by a change in keratinocyte adhesion molecule expression.	3.4158417432072743
The UV light is also able to influence the adhesive properties of melanocytes in vitro.	3.2404899305815
Therefore, both keratinocyte-derived factors and direct influence of UV on the melanocyte system are probably responsible for the morphologic changes.	3.1947465782452436
While these exogenously evoked changes are reversible, the potential biologic relevance - especially a possible role in the initiation of the carcinogenesis cascade - reguires clarification.	3.3679178681260793
The treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head involves a continuum based on a radiographic spectrum of disease.	3.388023952473309
Core decompression or pharmacological agents can be utilized for the earliest small or medium-sized pre-collapsed lesions.	3.075566486952622
For these types of lesions, osteotomy has been tried by various authors with moderate success.	3.258909513673654
For small or medium lesions that are post-collapse, various bone grafting procedures have been used.	3.4647224672077965
This approach should be tempered with a look at the articular cartilage if this is damaged or the lesion is large.	3.213145850864315
Limited femoral resurfacing can be used for hips that do not have acetabular involvement.	4.024101180289385
If there is acetabular involvement, total hip replacement remains the treatment of choice.	3.397393470535003
Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nerve system.	4.160265548872265
Clinical hallmarks are symmetric muscle paralysis, areflexia and pronouced autonomic disturbances.	2.801818812572324
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for intensive care support in patients with GBS.	4.792917907246067
The present report of a 33 year old man with Miller-Fisher syndrome, a variant of the GBS, discusses the management of patients with GBS in the intensive care unit.	3.4636448033415905
The immunocytological detection of disseminated epithelial cells in bone marrow in patients with breast cancer has been performed at many hospitals and institutes since the early 1980s.	3.8468804801516954
Despite numerous publications in this field, it has not been possible to standardize the method and  establish the ideal antibody, either nationally or internationally.	3.66000316810144
Molecular biological methods using PCR technology could extend the diagnostic spectrum.	3.334683063405487
However, one of the major problems in breast cancer is the lack of a disease-specific marker gene.	4.4565776529567565
As a result, immunocytology is still the standard procedure for tumour cell detection.	3.294205463836433
Objective: We report our initial experience with an improved model of the laryngeal mask airway, the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA, commercial name Fastrach), which was designed by A.I.J.	3.5177623131750138
Brain to improve blind endotracheal intubation through a laryngeal mask.	3.277797151728983
For several years it has been argued that a chest tube should be placed at the scene of an accident if thoracic trauma is suspected.	3.3522523369215764
However, during emergency treatment in hospital it has been observed that a high number of such tubes have been placed incorrectly.	3.857332336181986
To validate this impression, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical course of 33 trauma victims who had had chest tubes placed at the scene of accident.	3.866875614324802
It was found that 39.4% of the chest tubes were placed completey incorrectly and 21.2% required some correction; 39.4% were placed correctly.	2.8877756575969045
In two cases (6.1%) life-threatening complications developed because of the chest tube, necessitating a thoracotomy in 1 patient and repeated pericardial punction in the other.	3.5815918236226314
Based on the results of our study we believe that a more critical attitude should be adopted to the placement of chest tubes at the scene of the accident.	3.6707366647296236
Based upon the observation that some current approaches of quality assurance do not really come up to the specific characteristics of different psychotherapeutic settings, this article discusses quality assurance from the perspective of inpatient group psychotherapy.	3.2039186052511424
It differentiates issues of structural quality (e.g.	2.8343687660285304
the importance of the institutional frame, rules for indication, or treatment concepts), process quality with special consideration of problems connected with short term group treatment, and outcome quality, which in order to be assured needs the development of methods which reflect the group setting adequately.	3.9241811105299926
We report on a case of extensive intraabdominal calcifications resulting from previous bacterial peritonitis.	2.870723998799089
The patient suffered from an obstructive ileus.	3.270596684380824
Relaparotomy was performed and the calcifications resected.	3.9502868714340265
To avoid recurrence, radiotherapy (15 Gy) and indomethacin were given.	3.160776480509759
A literature review revealed only two cases of intraabdominal calcifications following peritonitis.	3.000892046682106
The announcement of research projects for mammography screening proves this.	3.1583275474026875
In 2 years, 2489 breast cancer cases were registered (status 6/98).	3.1269258972625087
Screening data were available for 1319 patients.	3.7057089961334633
The reduction in mortality, found in randomized studies, due to mammography in women over 50 years old was confirmed.	3.6200100809689397
A relative reduction of 44.8% in 10-year mortality could be estimated through mammography and 25.1% through palpation, in comparison with "doing nothing".	3.458895077321026
We could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the Munich region.	3.2501520435776685
If the mammographies carried out today were used at 2-year intervals for women aged between 50 and 70 years, then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70% of the women.	3.7041678680752157
The known facts regarding the population-based mortality and regarding the acceptance of the palpation screening and frequency of mammography are additional aspects for inclusion in the discussion of what research projects in Germany are and what they should fulfill.	3.071671448497373
Insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a typical complication.	3.262258865426452
Between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1997 a total of 604 operations at the ACL were performed in the traumatology department of Nuremberg hospital.	3.7645775825133576
There were various reasons for the failure of the transplant, some of them technical, occurring during the operation or during aftercare.	3.252646954360703
Another reason for a re-rupture of the transplant was by trauma.The different reasons for the failure of the transplant were analysed in our patient population.	3.7585965329714326
The 48 patients were classified into five groups depending on the primary operation and the means of treatment (I = ACL sutures, II = artificial ligament, III = semitendinosus tendon, IV and V = ipsi- or contralateral bone-patellar-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction), so that the different ways of treatment were better comparable.	3.4615822347764214
Of the 48 patients 36 were followed up over an average of 2 1/2 years using the Lysholm scores and the OAK scores.	3.5741896006830918
The total score of the 36 patients was 81 points and can be valued as good using the evaluation scale of Lysholm and Gillquist.	3.085608698393314
Using the OAK score we found an average of 71 to 81 points in the different groups; results in the group with the ipsilateral bone-tendon-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction were the worst.	3.583121215733679
The totalscore using the OAK score was 74 points and was considered "moderate".	3.331518735322261
The score results were discussed and compared with the current literature.	3.760396023442273
In this case report, we focus on the importance of scurvy as a differential diagnosis in a newborn presenting with swollen legs.	3.266840057972099
Scurvy is rare in highly developed countries and often overlooked.	3.595296171506593
Medical history, clinical symptoms and radiological findings are crucial for diagnosis.	4.2781983718181005
The diagnosis is confirmed by successful treatment with ascorbic acid.	2.9741337612967675
Hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal.	3.5616522173546077
Among these tumors, ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance.	2.9012710626240708
We describe a 26-year old female patient who presented with left-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.	3.3555125667990917
T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space-occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion.	3.669759684324703
Bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high-resolution computed tomography.	3.625865294475033
A hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach.	3.309032996573133
Histologically, new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma.	4.181907288288484
In general, radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma.	2.9591596849786637
Based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation, the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma.	3.534117392250896
However, reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation.	3.705566304600707
Myocardial ischemia results in myocardial dysfunction.	3.5402742214887084
Recovery may be delayed ("stunning"), or persistent if perfusion remains reduced ("hibernation") and ischemia may go on to necrosis, thus, contributing to chronic heart failure.	3.069834886593715
In addition, myocardium not directly affected by ischemia may undergo adaptive processes like hypertrophy and dilatation, which may result in chronic left heart failure.	3.239926295455512
This process is characterized by hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and progressive morphologic changes of the heart which are closely interrelated.	3.83127048122381
Hemodynamic changes basically consist of an increase in left ventricular filling pressure and a decrease in global ejection fraction, and, in most cases years after myocardial infarction, in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure.	4.644425099956342
Neurohumoral changes consist of an increase in plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin, and in an activation of the renin-angiotensin-system.	3.651040049507818
Plasma endothelin-1 was recently reported to be increased in patients with heart failure, and prognosis was related to endothelin levels.	4.4488385618759905
Diminished response of vessels to endothelium (EDRF/NO) dependent vasodilatation suggests impairment of vascular endothelium in heart failure.	3.0206491901160484
Local changes of cardiac neurohumoral systems could contribute to structural changes of the heart, e.g., systemic activation to hemodynamic changes.	3.5787517369857174
Structural changes of the heart are characterized by an increase in volume and thickness of surviving myocardium and an expansion of ischemic and necrotic myocardium.	3.955438184246791
Molecular control of these processes which include various cell types, such as cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts, are currently an issue of intense research and could result in specific therapeutic importance.	3.3648111874709867
Postoperative infection in the locomotor system may lead to malpractice suits.	3.65997651009554
The aim of the study was to determine the success rate of these claims and the type of expert-confirmed medical negligence so that strategies for avoiding such negligence can be offered.	3.045183466553491
A total of 261 decrees concerning suspected malpractice after postoperative infection in the locomotor system were retrospectively evaluated.	2.802823506978518
Of these, 43.7 % claims were successful.	2.842156440840315
The most frequent type of negligence was late diagnosis (34.2 %), followed by inconsistant treatment (27.2 %) and insufficient surgical revision (5.3 %).	2.958070225647459
In 33.3 %, combined types of negligence were found.	3.208162385241029
Most frequently, negligence was suspected after infection following hand surgery and internal fixation of long bones.	3.460984262447214
The highest success rate of claims was seen after puncture of joints (69.2 %).	3.1851661945628473
Insufficient documentation was confirmed in 15.3 %.	3.464455180846655
The majority of negligence resulted from diagnostic and therapeutic doubts, which could be avoided, e. g., by a clear definition of infection, consultation of a second opinion, a 2nd-look operation, undelayed and radical surgical revision, painstaking follow-up and disciplined documentation.	3.647810489034334
Abstract   Patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment.	5.053333002698923
The aim of the study was to compare health-related quality of life in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular or conventional surgery.	3.5617921442281486
A total of 40 patients were included (20 treated by endovascular and 20 by conventional surgery).	3.012160391991522
A questionnaire with 28 items similar to the SF-36 was answered during scheduled appointments.	2.9908979729517866
On the third postoperative day, the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed (80% vs. 32%) and complained of intervention-related pain (90% vs. 42%) and incisional pain (26% vs. 15%); 55% of the patients suffered from obstipation (vs. 5% of the endovascular group).	3.236724662692863
Furthermore, the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified.	3.1386446157485026
In comparable percentage, both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively.	3.135359883109427
In addition, the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities (25% vs. 40%) and had more fear of ambulation (35% vs. 6%).	2.763107692232273
The patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations (39% vs. 5%) that were often related to X-ray exposure (67% vs. 20%).	3.3497520439118795
All of the conventionally operated patients had a sense of improvement (vs. 89% of the endovascular group); nevertheless only 28% felt completely healthy, compared to 11% of the endovascular treated patients.	3.2391419553727325
Advantages of the endovascular treated patients were "short hospital stay", "decreased pain", "smaller scars", and a "shorter confinement to bed".	3.6889096270190587
After intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality-of-life aspects.	3.110769364666951
After 3 months, differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities.	3.348980937017867
The patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent X-ray examinations than the conventionally treated group.	3.4608579359580083
In the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period.	2.9921169674633936
However, about 20% of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation.	3.8459012900067076
Apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive, the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles.	3.5170246116137296
Furthermore, beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are, e.g., left heart failure, inadequate sedation, neuropsychiatric issues, malnutrition and aspiration.	3.1294983991728245
The mere application of a consistent weaning strategy (independent from its concrete content) leads to an improved success rate.	3.53961056626696
In this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with: 1) The concept of interventions (in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes unloading respiratory muscles), 2) pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3) organisation of the T-tube trials.	3.136206145959203
A new approach in weaning of long-term ventilated patients is non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NMV).	3.794444935724049
Compared to invasive mechanical ventilation NMV aims at reducing weaning time, decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis.	2.946520898275309
Finally, the last section addresses terminal weaning.	2.902798566842578
The psychoanalytic cure is characterized by a basic antinomy of time and time-lessness.	3.751893769889961
Freud based the daily psychoanalytic work on the order of the mechanic clock (the time of the machine) to regulate a relationship which is unique in our culture.	3.564243078587926
The temporal order of the cure responds to the logic of the temporal path.	2.953459918176006
On the opposite, in the world of the unconscious the familiar concepts of cause and effect as well as of before and after are abolished.	4.211998367302441
"Symmetrical madness" prevails (Matte Blanco).	3.025958968797105
The temporal core of the analytic situation is bi-logical.	3.1829930035897713
This ambiguity is reflected in the technical principles.	3.5860179388049245
Free association breaks through the logic of the temporal path, again and again.	2.9771992605573088
There are, however, different defence strategies defusing its unforeseeability.	3.633669993386607
The tension between the time that determines the analytic setting and the timelessness of free association gets once again a process of temporal order going.	3.0394352176598436
Present social changes and in connection with them the changed time strategies endanger the temporal order of the analytic cure.	3.3800149991181088
Several historical reports focusing on the heredity of migraine, as well as recent studies on its epidemiology and molecular biology, have revealed evidence for a decisive role of genetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of familial migraine.	3.7381865912711874
Indeed, family studies, segregation analyses and twin studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in disposition towards migraine but could not explain the entire aetiopathogenesis.	3.1419434415852074
The influence of extragenetic factors, however, remains mostly unknown.	3.534977707676833
Recent linkage analyses have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity.	3.363856021689367
A locus for Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM), the only known type of migraine that follows autosomal-dominant transmission, has been linked to chromosome 19p13 but genetic heterogeneity has also been shown, i. e. different types of migraine could be excluded from this locus.	3.647640357940037
Further investigations should concentrate on identifying the FHM gene on chromosome 19p13, on linkage analyses with markers for different susceptibility genes, and on genomic analyses of highly informative pedigrees.	3.015530675764847
This would lead to further clues to the pathogenesis underlying migraine and, thus, to therapeutic developments.	3.66118817420525
Radiographic findings suggestive of osteopenia and osteoporosis are frequently encountered in daily medical practice and can result from a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from highly prevalent causes such as postmenopausal and involutional osteoporosis to very rare endocrinologic and hereditary or acquired disorders.	2.926591716580954
As bone mass is lost, changes in the trabecular and cortical bone structure occur.	3.638682602940635
The changes that are visible on conventional radiographs may give specific information on the etiology of the underlying disease.	3.765726687339601
Even though conventional radiography is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis, visual assessment of bone mass and its changes is subjective and strongly depends on the radiographic technique.	3.4833189823247697
With radiogrammetry and radiographic absorptiometry two methods exist that rely on conventional radiography and allow for a quantification of bone mass.	3.1969542825995

The article is focused on the work in the Musculoskeletal Research Center and the Center for Sports Medicine of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in Pittsburgh.	3.2995130700982167
The author describes projects on the biomechanics of the cruciate ligaments, using robotic technology.	2.9660999465970272
Organizational and social aspects of the life in Pittsburgh are discussed.	3.90728451010474
The different subgroups of hypercalciuria cannot be separated clearly by the Pak calcium-load test.	2.4639391541618783
To improve the diagnosis and therapy we examined all relevant parameters of calcium metabolism in 32 patients with calcium urolithiasis and hypercalciuria (> 6.25 mmol/day).	3.406373765446312
We also conducted bone mineral density measurements as well as the Pak calcium-load test.	3.029113254252234
In most cases the pathophysiological constellations which Pak takes as the basis for his classification of hypercalciuria could not be shown.	3.458011455186511
To date, diagnostics only insufficiently explains the genesis of hypercalciuria (except pHPT).	2.743356144832692
As a consequence, a therapeutic problem arises: a low-calcium diet should not be generally recommended, since some patients may develop osteopenia.	3.3463417048955764
From our investigation the following diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions can be drawn: (1) Hypercalciuria in primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated by surgical removal of the adenoma.	4.180220239378565
(2) The parathormone-independent osteogenic form should be treated with thiazides.	3.8073274710079072
(3) Hypercalciuria with increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D should be treated by low-calcium diet.	3.468911695831263
A 58-year old man with wilson's disease sustained a bilateral spontaneous rupture of the quadriceps tendon.	3.4159539164093724
The histological investigation showed advanced degeneration of tendon structure and cupper deposits.	2.9150793419653755
After tenosuture the patient had complete cure with full range of movement.	3.4659620655651655
We discuss about relation of wilson x s disease, cupper deposits and degenerative changes of tendon tissue.	2.934504484366732
Within the framework of the National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 the Short Form Questionnaire SF-36 has been applied to measure the health related quality of life (HRQOL).	2.7418850588313846
This opened more opportunities than simply creating a new normative sample for the German adult population.	3.1924845718939245
Thus, the very complex interdependence between morbidity, satisfaction, risk factors, health related behaviours, social status, age and sex on the one side and the subjective assessment of health related quality of life on the other hand may be investigated.	3.576429931488868
First results of the Survey data are presented which open the discussion of the possibilities and limits of the SF-36 instrument for measuring health related quality of life at the population level.	3.6014710440839472
The von Willebrand's Disease affects about 1-3 % of the population and it is undiagnosed in most people.	3.7875247397181577
Originally described by the Finish physician Erik von Willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis, hypermenorhoea and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures.	3.046949891452456
In von Willebrands disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) which has two major functions: it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall, and it circulates as a complex with factor VIII, protecting it from rapid degradation.	3.2009799991044967
More than 20 different types and subtypes of vWD have been described but almost all patients can be classified as having 1 of the 2 most common types of vWD.	4.025343331708787
About 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10-20 % present themself with type 2A and 2B vWD type 3 in about 10 %.	3.263005082729664
By taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vWD and to make the appropriate diagnosis.	3.8060044957757513
If the vWD is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, factor VIII:C, Ristocetin cofactor, and vWF antigen.	2.7883003851239057
Additional testing of ristocetin induced plattlet adhesion (RIPA), the multimeric structure and collagen binding test and gen-analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v. Willebrand Disease.	3.1330134574844295
The treatment of choice in mild forms is the synthetic agent desmopressin.	3.167539500857446
In patients with severe type 1, type 2B, 2N and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin, the appropriate treatment is a factor VIII concentrate that is rich of vWF.	3.217703949874508
Until now no recommendations in the orthopaedic literature have been found regarding diagnosis and treatment of vWS patients.	3.4887265637745437
Based on the experience with 43 orthopaedic patients presenting vWD over the last 15 years a contemporary guideline for the successful perioperative management of vWD in orthopaedic surgery is presented.	3.05081751908366
Patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) have a high risk of perioperative reinfarction compared with the normal population (5%-8% vs. 0.1%-0.7%) [10].	3.8081852321263687
According to Rao [13], a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range.	3.3089411026890128
In most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as Rao recommended: this would overstrain both hospital structure and financial resources.	3.3605655308254425
We studied the incidence of perioperative MI and other cardiac events in patients with prior MI.	4.3753797372154155
During the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced.	3.0380602828207697
In addition to this clinical evaluation, we performed perioperative Holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin T (parts II and III).	3.0950251634564747
Small basal cell carcinomas of the trunk are usually regarded as relatively harmless.	3.887680503010288
In contrast, large and ulcerating basal cell carcinomas may become a therapeutic challenge with a less favourable prognosis and high risk of recurrence.	3.546297851173085
The development of mutilating giant basal cell carcinomas appears less due to the biological aggressive character of the tumors, but rather to the patients' attitude of neglect.	3.6274394875889295
The case of a 62-year-old patient, featuring such attitude, demonstrates how a common basal cell carcinoma of the trunk can grow over a period of years to a troublesome ulcerating tumor.	3.3124669837038203
This epidemiologic, retrospective follow-up mortality study is based on the data gathered in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital of Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main.	3.5694169118167234
Over a period of 21 years (1972-1992), roughly 21,000 forensic autopsies revealed 39 cases (0.19%) of natural deaths occuring during sexual activity.	2.8613722618090494
Except for two women, all of these cases were men of an average age of 61.3 years.	3.975930722149343
The most frequent cause of death was myocardial infarction (n=21/53.8%), three of these cases involving pericardial tamponade accompanied by myomalacia.	3.461066856108253
The medical history of twelve of the deceased showed a previous myocardial infarction.	3.2550180831414077
Most of the deaths took place during or after sexual intercourse or manual stimulation.	2.9819451212350034
In most cases sudden death occured during the sexual act with a prostitute.	2.7704193666224124
The annual incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths during sexual activity is estimated to be 0.2/100,000 men.	3.3768264511027266
The risk for women is lower by a factor of 12.	3.2979921883438994
Problem: An investigation into CT-controlled carve-suction biopsy for a histological clarification of indefinite intrathoracic masses.	2.993780135176279
Current concepts in treating arthritis by gene transfer are described, including different vector systems and strategies of gene transfer into target cells.	3.2498648532590257
Promissing antiarthritic gene products are a variety of growth factors which facilitate increased matrix synthesis and mitogensis in articular chondrocytes.	3.6298124665695353
Furthermore, rheumatoid joint destruction can be treated genetically by the transfer of certain antiinflammatory cytokine genes, which provide locally high concentrations of the antiinflammatory gene product.	3.276848766367782
First clinical trails using the IRAP gene (interleukin I receptor antagonist protein) to eliminate the inflammatory reaction caused by interleukin I in rheumatoid joints are on its way.	3.048037239328045
In order to investigate potential improvement in cartilage regeneration retroviral TGF- gene transfer in rabbit articular chondrocytes has been carried out.	2.6261038994687866
The TGF- group showed an in vitro increase in collagen type II neosynthesis by 304 %, compared to normal chondrocytes.	3.2270539322424936
Spreading depression is a fascinating phenomenon that can be provoked by chemical, electrical or mechanical stimuli of the cortex.	3.2522432684558025
Spreading depression-like transient depolarizations are observed in the periinfarct tissue after focal ischemia.	3.2481260535648517
The reduction in electrical activity and a negative direct current potential shift propagating over the cortex with a rate of 2-5 mm/minute are the physiological hallmarks.	3.3028249965627547
It is thought that spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations might play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine and stroke.	2.7107967191423183
However, these events have never been detected in humans.	3.1184355248605686
This paper reviews the physiological characteristics of spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations and discusses their potential role in migraine and stroke.	2.3476422071895504
The MMR combined vaccination reveals an effective method for prevention of these diseases and their consecutive symptoms.	3.8567665183473205
By means of the twice-done MMR vaccination measles, mumps and the congenital rubella syndrome could be eliminated.	2.821275718423166
With the increasing demands on hospitals for improved quality and lower costs, hospitals have been forced to reevaluate their manner of operation and quality assurance programms.	3.143121235856946
Hospitals have also been faced with customer dissatisfaction and intense competition.	3.1509678285081684
This article reviews current quality-management systems and examines their position in dermatology.	2.926207520138079
The continuous follow-up of all cruciate ligament lesions showed the correctness of patient-adapted procedures.	3.4054733476153003
While the gold standard for repair is a replacement procedure, direct repair with autologous augmentation is an excellent option in adolescents.	3.4480100190581955
The results of 13 single-stage reconstructions of large and complex defects in the head and neck by using eight free radial forearm flaps as well as five pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps were analyzed.	3.2785356856907426
No complete flap loss occurred in any case.	3.036317535965018
The results with radial forearm flap reconstructions proved to be better functionally and aesthetically.	3.4118360035191473
Due to the time needed for the microvascular anastomoses, the length of the operations was sometimes prolonged.	3.2767924498548373
Pectoralis major flaps were found to be more difficult to handle and were used in those cases in which the application of free radial forearm flaps was expected to produce higher risks.	4.079833101686082
Psychotherapists have the alternative, to design quality assurance within certain boundaries by themselves, or otherwise leave this important task to external instances.	3.0592220260751866
Those will apply their own criteria in developing a concept.	3.3217146101761332
This paper discusses the question, how far quality assurance in the field of analytic psychotherapy has to accept the definitions and concepts from other fields such as industry or somatic medicine, without changing or deteriorating the quality that in the end should be improved.	3.1985969835354098
Differentiation is necessary between the use of the Psy-BaDo for individual quality assurance of the individual psychotherapist and for quality- and psychotherapy-research.	3.754420984941433
This paper points out new approaches to modifying the present concept of quality assurance for the purposes of analytic psychotherapy.	3.1214718149447513
Cicatrical pemphigoid (CP) comprises a groupf of patients with a chronic subepidermal blistering disease which primarily involves mucous membranes; lesions characteristically heal with scarring.	3.3727464277378587
Immunofluorescence investigations typically demonstrate deposits of tissue bound and circulating immunoreactants of the IgG and less frequently of the IgA class in a linear pattern along the basement membrane zone.	2.7402887913958764
These autoantibodies are thought to play an important role in the blister formation of CP.	3.2303577719687304
Most patients show binding to the bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BPag2), collagen type XVII, with a molecularweight of 180 kD.	3.2516434985826046
Animal models confirm that autoantibodies binding to these two adhesion molecules (BPag2 and laminin 5) are important in blister formation.	3.150530672010828
There are other autoantigens described in CP; however, they are only found in small groups of CP patients and most of them are not further characterised.	3.5124348981943307
The described molecules are part of the hemidesmosomal adhesion complex.	3.665281153716964
Impaired function of any component of this complex may lead to a separation of the epidermis from the dermis; better knowledge about the single molecules and the exact localisation of epitopes within these molecules may lead to further understanding of the clinical picture.	4.1285083425244595
Study objective: The clinical effect of ketoprofen is based not only on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.	3.2163151792332783
Ketoprofen also acts through kynurenic acid as a central antagonist on the NMDA receptor.	3.169015797461855
This study was carried out following the Breivik/Stubhaug preemptive effect study design.	2.7980462397523773
Dystopies of the bony orbit are caused mainly by craniosynostosis, facial clefts and encephaloceles.	3.291475546061624
This article presents the results of the surgical correction of orbital hypertelorism in 24 patients.	3.7839902806985264
Using this operation technique, the bony interorbital distance was decreased from an average of 47.6 mm to 22.8 mm.	3.4668820054773763
However, the distance between the soft tissues was not reduced by the same amount as the distance between the bony orbits.	3.1737723573523424
The intercanthal distance decreased from an average of 58.5 mm to 44.5 mm, whereby an additional refixation of the medial palpebral ligament resulted in a reduction of the intercanthal distance to 40.8 mm.	3.5299990533345142
A strabismus divergens was seen preoperatively in 18 patients, postoperatively only in 8 patients.	3.5929522026525613
Four of the latter had to undergo operative correction of the diplopia.	3.494420255015134
We conclude that the operative technique is not reserved only for complex cases of hypertelorism because it shows satisfactory functional and aesthetic results with a low complication rate.	3.4043096794347982
Four years after extensive pneumonectomy on the left side with resection of the aortic wall and patch reconstruction for a T4 carcinoma, 2 years after adjuvant radiation and 10 months after drainage therapy of late intrathoracic empyema, destruction of the infected Dacron patch led to rupture of the aorta descendens.	3.698763648855043
The rate of prosthetic infections is between 0.3 and 2.5% and must be taken into consideration even in cases of intrathoracic vascular reconstruction with alloplastic prostheses.	3.416617999759302
After lung resection it is necessary to cover up the prosthetic graft by using autogenous material to obtain prosthetic incorporation into the protective tissue.	3.216252575290264
In intrathoracic infectious complications, extra-anatomic bypass grafting or autogenous vascular graft implantation should be considered.	3.2914031794603456
If there is no possibility of carrying out these procedures, first aggressive local debridement of the infected vascular wall and afterwards coverage with alloplastic prosthetics with omentum transposition and thoracoplasty are essential to minimize postoperative infection and obtain solid anchorage in the surrounding tissue.	2.969790999755179
The evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most intriguing and challenging aspects of the daily practice in dermatohistopathology.	3.4123644639525432
For the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and melanocytic nevi, standardized and reproducible criteria are required.	3.720253612975628
In case of the diagnosis of melanoma, the histopathological report must include all important data relevant for the prognosis which may also influence the therapeutic procedure.	3.8270549919911083
The following paper summarizes the recommendations of the study group on malignant melanoma formed by the Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft.	3.579618764096907
Recent studies have shown that acute infections, especially of the respiratory tract, are an important risk factor for cerebral ischemia.	3.5382411905840163
Additionally we know that chronic dental infections may be a risk for myocardial infarction and artherosclerosis.	4.106827535311886
However, the connection between stroke and dental infections has hardly been examined so far.	2.9522070885045735
Therefore we performed a case-control study using a standardized questionaire and examination.	3.595503773334202
We investigated 66 patients consecutive to a acute cerebral ischemia/stroke and 60 age- and sex-matched nonstroke neurological patients as a control group.	2.9100146935657087
Dental status was determined by a so called total dental index (TDI) which reflects primarily caries, periodontitis, periapical lesions, devital and missing teeth as well as by a panoramic index (PI).	3.0367940981153585
Specifically, older patients with cerebrovascular ischemia tended to have a significantly worse dental status and had more severe periodontitis and periapical lesions than control subjects.	3.4118350994109106
A predefined poor dental status was associated with cerebrovascular ischemia independent from other vascular risk factors and social status.	3.742532801442259
In conclusion, poor dental health, mainly resulting from chronic dental infections, may be associated with an increased risk for cerebrovascular ischemia.	3.433919245903161
The results must now be verified in larger studies.	3.166838099872551
As chronic dental infections are a common and also easily treatable factor, their identification as a risk factor for stroke would be quite important in the field of preventive medicine.	3.6774128266076493
Adjuvant basic therapy plays a central role  in the therapeutic approach to atopic eczema in childhood.	3.913303207701952
It involves the regular use of emollients and oil baths according to the clinical picture.	3.6844859413335
Emollients containing urea may cause problems when used in younger children due to their stinging effect.	3.4216517833636497
Glucocorticosteroids still form the mainstay  of anti-inflammatory therapy and are superior to other topical drugs with anti-inflammatory effects.	3.7325057589292423
Antihistamines preferably of the sedative type can be used successfully  during periods of exacerbation.	3.603856809721628
Systemic use of antibiotics is essential in cases of impetiginized atopic eczema.	4.405228120457448
In cases of bacterial-triggered eczema, the topical use of antibiotics in cases of limited or of antiseptics in generalized disease may be helpful.	3.591270310668946
The present paper presents data obtained over a 12 year period, on the matrix synthesis and turnover in some 650 arthritic and 180 non-arthritic (N) human cartilages using a standardised in vitro method.	3.3028764594658546
When the relative metabolic (synthetic/repair activity) of these human cartilages was compared, it was demonstrated that in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cartilages synthetic activity was diminished by approximately 50% as compared with N cartilages.	3.1886064395671747
However, the turnover rate of matrix was not significantly different between Non-arthritic and OA, but was very substantially increased in RA cartilages compatible with the activity of inflammatory cells and proteolytic enzymes released from pannus.	3.1012343315813573
The action of 13 NSAIDs was compared in terms of their effect on cartilage GAG synthesis.	3.1281331561905024
3 of these NSAIDs were also studied in terms of their effect on cartilage collagen synthesis.	3.2998212510502802
Consideration of the results in this study and from published material, led to the suggestion that NSAIDs may be divided into 3 categories in respect of their in vitro action on the extracellular matrix of human arthritic cartilages:   1.	3.6346168148530977
Those such as Aceclofenac, Tenidap and Tolmetin which can stimulate matrix synthesis 2.	2.8619710085985557
Those such as Piroxicam, Tiaprofenic Acid and Aspirin which appear to be without significant effect on matrix synthesis and, 3.	3.093495709019768
Those like Naproxen, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin, Nimezulide which significantly inhibit matrix synthesis.	2.746666378081405
It is suggested that the stimulatory action of group 1 NSAID is due to inhibition of locally produced IL1 and consequent expression of growth factor activity.	3.091694574324699
Other NSAIDs may also inhibit IL1 synthesis or release, but probably do not have a beneficial effect on chondrocyte synthetic activity as they have toxic effects on cartilage metabolism.	3.0604811047731406
These experiments led to the suggestion that NSAIDs such as Aceclofenac would be appropriate for long-term treatment of arthritic conditions provided that one is prepared to extrapolate between in vitro experiments on human cartilage and what may be happening in vivo.	3.010232148885819
The article begins with a general introduction to the problems of pre-operative anxiety and its impact on the post-operative course development.	4.158315655986434
Then the treatment of a patient who developed an anxiety-syndrome before a necessary heart operation is described.	4.18517680613724
The treatment lasted 6 hours and included psychotherapy by guided affective imagery.	2.831214942472085
One and a half years later a follow-up interview was carried out by a colleague of the original therapist.	4.19852187037368
The interview was based on the assumption that patients are able to give a competent statement about their previous treatment.	4.087239346717807
The results are discussed under the aspect of therapeutic factors of psychotherapy.	2.9623419525743886
Physiologically, angiogenesis in adults is a controlled process which plays a role, for example, in wound healing.	3.8715056800254017
Pathological angiogenesis is observed in tumor formation and represents a multifactorial process, in which specific angiogenic factors, as well as growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules are involved.	3.842919769755634
Tumor growth is characterized by an imbalance in favor of angiogenic over angiogenesis-inhibiting factors.	3.634743427994086
Some of the most frequently examined angiogenic factors are vascular endothelial growth factor, acidic/basic fibroblast growth factors and the platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor.	3.3715746294219877
To date, the clinical relevance of tumor angiogenesis has been shown for several human tumors.	4.074241780700419
For most urological tumors, the grade of tumor vessel formation, measured as microvessel density, has been associated with metastases, tumor growth and clinical course.	3.5434478004441354
The prognostic value of this feature of malignant growth seems to be higher than that of most of the classical and newer prognostic factors.	4.089633225745797
Systematic investigations of tumor angiogenesis are becoming increasingly relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and offer opportunities for the development of new specific therapeutic approaches in clinical oncology.	4.06650965468664
Introduction: CPR is an essential part of resuscitation.	3.833595870030516
German medical students must take part in at least two low-level basic life support courses, one for a driver's license and one for admission to medical school.	3.370924068099531
The knowledge and skill of German medical students in CPR performance were studied.	2.958640589320217
Psychoanalysis is regarded to be mainly disorderoriented.	3.4207423044482885
Indeed, since its beginning, it was characterised by the two-sided orientation towards disorder and resources.	3.6941657913709447
Contemporary concepts of the psychoanalytic encounter, especially actualgenetic conceptions of the analysis of transference, lay the ground for better integrating both aspects.	3.2644465842682497
This development implies new approaches to the psychoanalytic process and technique, and especially to interpretation.	3.820641852493249
More than before, contemporary psychoanalytic interpretation refers to progressive coping strategies within and outside transferential processes.	2.75701412212439
During the last few decades, traumatic injuries of the hip joint have significantly increased in number, and traffic accidents have also increased.	3.46567520375877
Depending on the speed, direction of the forces and the position of the femur at the moment of impact, different patterns of injury occur.	3.4367142694672577
Basically, they are classified as hip dislocations, dislocation fractures and acetabular fractures.	3.3614881102893586
These injuries have in common a high rate of concomitant lesions.	3.5257456783207712
Several classification systems have been developed for these injuries.	4.406876339766732
Commonly, Stewart and Milford's or Levin's classification is used for dislocations and dislocation fractures.	3.139649932562882
For acetabular fractures, Judet and Letournel's classification and its newer version developed by Helfet (AO classification) are generally accepted.	3.257459810526769
Fractures of the femoral head, though included in these classifications, are typically described by separate classifications like the one presented in 1957 by Pipkin.	3.1470112042911884
The multitude of injuries occuring in the hip joint requires vast knowledge of various operative approaches.	3.3513145479931423
No single approach exists that would permit the treatment of all injuries in an ideal fashion.	3.9082666861182505
The choice of the best approach for an individual patient depends on the type of injury and also on patient variables like age, preexisting disease, and concomitant injuries.	3.8411222304998773
The decision is further influenced by the timing of surgery, the kind of fracture stabilization intended and by complications typically seen with certain approaches.	3.532378449240931
The indication for extended procedures is only seen in patients with complex injury patterns involving both the anterior and the posterior column or in delayed cases undergoing surgery more than 3 weeks after trauma.	3.6751213422860163
Extended approaches permit excellent visualization of the fracture, but the extent of the soft tissue trauma is reflected in a high rate of postoperative complications.	5.472512056480815
After a phase in which extended procedures were favored, recently a trend towards more limited approaches can be recognized because of their lower complication rate.	2.9675120345166497
This is facilitated by modern fracture-reduction methods using indirect techniques.	2.922876000287888
A relation between myocardial ischemia and induction of ventricular arrhythmias can be demonstrated in patients with coronary heart disease - in contrast to patients with primary non ischemic cardiac diseases - using a combined metabolic-electrophysiological investigation protocol consisting of programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation with simultaneous measurement of the arterio/coronary venous difference for lactate, pyruvate, free fatty acids and amino acids.	3.4425948494987546
There are significant metabolic distinctions between both ischemic and non ischemic heart disease under pacing stress conditions as well as at rest.	3.3658615927534608
A 52 year old female with Parry-Romberg syndrome presented with gradual atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and muscle on her chest and back.	3.0873236711606835
The disease process was limited to the C3 to T2 dermatomes on the right side.	3.0575563866760187
In addition, there was muscle atrophy of the right arm and extending down the back to T10, als well as right sided paralysis of the diaphragm.	3.2639423282206628
Sympathetic nerve blockage reduced pain and hyperesthesia; no progression was seen over several months using NMR to monitor the patient.	3.1312632653981716
The Parry-Romberg syndrome has been defined in many ways; in view of this unusual case, we review the literature, attempting to provide a more accurate case definition.	3.9698411159289013
Between 1990 and 1996, 129 children (mean age 4.8 years) with hip pain were examined consecutively.	3.833895086108902
In group I (n = 100, mean age 4.14  +/-  2.2), transient synovitis of the hip was diagnosed; group II (n = 29, mean age 7.3  +/-  2.1) showed the following diagnoses: Perthes' disease (n = 12), early slipped capital femoral epiphysis (n = 5), Meyer's dysplasia (n = 2), septic arthritis of the hip (n = 2), osteomyelitis of the acetabulum (n = 1), abscess of the psoas (n = 1), chondromatosis of the hip joint (n = 1), Ewing's sarcoma of the os pubis (n = 1), hip dysplasia (n = 1).	3.7587173401300027
Three patients who had synovitis developed Perthes' disease and were assigned to group II.	3.602593870045514
A capsular distension was present in 73 cases and showed a significant statistical difference (t-test, P < 0.001) in group I between affected and unaffected hips.	4.1608513333834525
There were no differences in the measurements of the epiphyseal and metaphyseal width in group I between the affected and the non-affected side (t-test, P = 0.91, P = 0.57) and between the first sonographic evaluation at presentation and at the follow-up (t-test, P = 0.053, P = 0.75).	3.4361968617656498
MRI was performed, because of persistent joint effusion, in 10 cases in group I, and Perthes' disease was excluded.	4.6560657888626436
In group II the use of an MRI allowed the diagnosis in 89 % of the cases.	4.184647629777209
Sonographic examination, together with X-ray examination and serological testing, represent the first choices in the evaluation of a painful hip at presentation and in the follow-up of transient synovitis.	4.141274557041034
MRI should always be performed when abnormalities are present at the clinical and sonographic examination, and when the X-ray does not allow a clear diagnosis.	4.2105363173056025
A 36-year old woman was presented to our hospital with congenital ventricular septal defect and one-vessel coronary artery disease (75% proximal left main coronary artery) for CABG and repair of the VSD.	3.3430954216341875
After induction, a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) baseline examination was performed, showing a severely dilated coronary sinus (CS) measuring approximately 3 cm (abnormal >1 cm).	3.088642811903807
We suggested a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) draining into the CS.	3.182430848718401
PLSVC is a common venous congenital anomaly, with a reported incidence of 0.5% in general population and in 3-5 % of patients with congenital heart defect.	4.706751496839331
Injection of echo-contrast solution in a left arm vein, visualizing microbubbles passing through the PLSVC into the CS confirmed our suspicion.	2.8624384051519733
It may be difficult to pass a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) through a left internal or left subclavian vein and it may be associated with arrythmias.	3.4358796506191047
A chest radiograph shows the anomalous course of the PAC along the left heart.	3.7229348327905485
Teleradiologysystems can differ considerably in their features.	3.464623230870076
The most important differences lie in the mode of image data acquisition, data transfer, data safety aspects and the possibilities of interaction between seperate teleradiology units.	3.191213950051602
A selection of commercially available teleradiologysystems is presented and compared.	3.586349080268997
Craniopharyngiomas are the third frequent pediatric brain tumors.	3.400885917808045
Complications after surgical treatment are common.	3.9691210940835457
The most frequent complications are endocrine disturbances, vision field defects, deteriorated acuity, cognitive or psychological deficiency as well as significant weight gain.	3.4006775232200974
A case of complete vision loss right after surgical removal of craniopharyngioma is reported.	2.907745370799315
Magnetic resonance image showed an edema of the chiasm.	3.3406407385560377
No damage of anatomical structure could be detected.	3.767682394705182
Seventeen days after surgery the patient reported intermittent  visual impressions for the first time.	3.5503257353435838
Over the following weeks his visus improved to  0.5, while the chiasm edema disappeared.	3.4487565202114605
Electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) allows viszalization and quantification of calcium in the coronary arteries.	3.175323770869646
This has been demonstrated to correlate well with the overall plaque burden in the coronary arteries.	3.476095342617225
EBCT is, therefore, well suited for the detection of early stages of coronary atherosclerosis.	3.648334388605817
Especially in asymptomatic patients with several risk factors, staging coronary artery disease by coronary calcium, scanning may allow prognostic assessment and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions.	3.2522072805565165
We report an unusual complication in a 53-year-old woman following ileostomy for Crohn's disease 22 years previously.	2.88815425219602
A stenosis of the distal colonic segment was the reason for the formation and subsequent rupture of a huge colonic mucocele.	4.113161319051008
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a ruptured mucocele of colonic origin after ileostomy.	2.484933399743787
The brain is an important target organ for gonadal hormones.	3.751038383971234
Estrogens have protective and trophic effects on neural systems and modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems.	3.0910234819436235
Initial studies support the hypothesis that estrogen therapy in menopause may have protective effects toward the development of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.	3.5084029270949753
Furthermore, estrogens may improve verbal fluency, memory, and mood in elderly women.	2.855658792816993
Still, the available evidence is not sufficient to support general treatment recommendations with respect to estrogens and the therapeutic targets dementia and depression.	4.013938027792337
A 38-year-old male patient presented with circumscribed scleroderma (10x12 cm) in the left pectoral area.	3.3488680279975656
Hyperaemia of the skin in the area of the lilac ring (morphoea) was quantified by means of Laser-Doppler flux (LDF).	3.6961282876978547
At the lilac border of the morphoea LDF was increased to 420% of the reference value recorded for the unaffected skin of the contralateral side.	3.3447221208824565
Immediately after 13 days of antibiotic therapy (3x10 Mega penicillin G per day, i.v.)	3.4127517262427527
By 6 months later, LDF was still in the normal range, and clinical signs, such as induration and hyperaemic redness, had also significantly improved.	3.56670802163976
LDF measurements allow assessment of the therapeutic response to antibiotic therapy at a very early stage while the clinical situation is still unchanged.	3.9663445437185683
It is generally accepted that the progression of an idiopathic scoliotic deformity with a Cobb angle of between 25  ° and 40  ° can be stopped by brace treatment alone provided that the generally acknowledged criteria for the treatment concerning skeletal growth of the individual are respected.	3.3841450639704935
The medical treatment of erectile dysfunction includes the systemic (oral, epidermal, intramuscular) as well as the local (intracavernosal, intraurethral) application of pharma cological agents.	3.0722469252974296
Up to now only yohimbine, a well-known alpha-receptor blocking agent, and sildenafil, a newly introduced phosphodiesterase V inhibitor with predominant peripheral action, have been approved and listed in Germany.	3.0124747943854238
Other oral agents under investigation are trazodone and apomorphine (central action) as well as phentolamine (peripheral action).	3.326530899143392
For the small group of patients with an established testosterone deficit, the epidermal or intramuscular substitution of testosterone seems to be a reasonable alternative to other therapeutic options.	3.9567466803798332
For the local application of pharmacological agents, intracavernosal injection therapy and intraurethral application ("medicated urethral system for erection", MUSE) are available.	2.86925489570768
Currently, several promising pharmacological agents with different modes of action and routes of administration are under investigation.	3.031515672758866
The ultimate goal of these basic and clinical research efforts is to develop a specific and "tailored" therapy for each individual patient.	3.3066725845587825
While the pharmacological therapy of erectile dysfunction will most likely continue to be the therapeutic standard for most patients, it will certainly be augmented by devices (i. e. vacuum erection devices, "functional electromyostimulation of the corpus cavernosum", FEMCC) and surgical treatment options (vascular and prosthetic surgery).	3.33313762978615
We treated a large superficial basal cell carcinoma (ca.	3.2312672831221145
10x6 cm) on the right breast in a 48-year old woman with photodynamic terapy (PDT).	3.8643121502834834
Fractionated PDT was performed by topical application of -aminolevulinic acid (-ALA, 20%) with subsequent red light (570-750 nm; 180 J/cm2) in three sessions.	3.3272654566474307
Nearly total remission of the tumor resulted; however, a few residual neoplastic islands partly infiltrating the nipple-areola complex could be detected by photodynamic diagnosis (PDD).	3.4522546282196025
These fluorescent areas were marked, excised, and the defect was closed by a rotation advancement flap.	3.8081744717324733
Total excision of the tumor was verified histologically.	5.1573253679647735
By combining PDT and surgery, this large tumor was treated with excellent cosmetic results.	3.3063846721418644
This case demonstrates the efficiency of topical PDT with adjunctive plastic surgery controlled by PDD even in large tumors.	3.1354788856636064
Ninety out of 189 patients (47,6%) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant melanoma who noted morphological changes in a pigmented lesion reported the mole had been present at least 10 years.	3.7468452338160594
20,7% stated it was present since birth.	3.419309341566233
156 out of 189 patients (82,5%) noticed changes in the lesion over the time.	3.9211124731168145
Growth, discolouration and elevation were the most frequent changes but no significant early sign of disease was found.	3.7106217400819217
Bleeding and crusting were found with tumor thickness >1,5 mm and thus be signs of an advanced stage.	3.599142876181898
Almost 6 months passed until half of the patients visited a physician, either because of changes in the mole or in the lesion was detected during other medical examinations.	4.142378015398525
In the second period of the survey from 1993 to 1995 the physician was frequently consulted earlier.	2.891859786203641
The main reasons for the delay between identification by the patient and seeking medical cedure were lack of symptoms and the notion that the lesion was harmless.	3.585952570951809
Only 72 out of 189 patients (38,1%) visited the physician on their own initiative.	3.334355030131109
The primary evaluation of the "pigmental lesion" was done by a primary care physician in 57%, by a dermatologist in 32% and by others in 11% of our cases.	3.639930464867055
A diagnosis of a non-melanoma was made and no further steps were initiated by 27% of the primary care physicians and 22,7% of the surgeons, gynecologists or internists.	3.932448970848825
Only 5% of the dermatologists misdiagnosed the lesions.	3.69209148979735
In the second trial period from 1993 to 1995 in all physician groups the rate of misdiagnosis increased due to changes in heathcare services in the context of privatisation in our health care system in East Germany.	3.148416140279161
Whereas 83,2% of the patients first evaluated by dermatologists had a surgical removal of the mole within the first 2 months after consultation, the proportion for those diagnosed by non-dermatologists was only 58,5%.	4.038191306276515
The rate of primary treatment by surgeons, often with a small safety margin, also increased.	3.2614348454122633
In 45 patients with Parkinson's disease, we investigated coping behavior and its correlations to demographic and disease-related data, locus of control, depression, and psychosocial adaptation.	3.7216687872424954
Active, problem oriented, and self-reorganizing strategies were predominantly used and regarded as especially helpful by the 27 men and 18 women (age: 56 years; duration of illness: 9 years).	3.138016439594405
While age and sex were not associated with coping, external locus of control correlated positively to "depressive coping" and duration of illness correlated negatively to "distraction and self-affirmation."	3.364398991058232
Coping strategies regarded as maladaptive and a small degree of internal locus of control correlated to unfavourable results for depression and satisfaction.	2.98745004726044
The Internet has become a powerful, international source for information, and it has shown an exponential growth because of the ease of access and the immediate availability of information.	3.7134061045636817
We introduced a new ophthalmological atlas including ICD coding on the World Wide Web.	2.96745772875627
So far, more than 500 lantern slides of typical and interesting ophthalmological findings have been selected and digitized.	3.18003246605578
These pictures were integrated in a data base, which was arranged for ease and speed of search and retrieval.	3.464812223919074
In its background, the data base contains a list of over 4700 ICD-encoded diagnoses to which the picture-documented findings are linked.	3.3364170989207342
Comments on pictures can be added by the author or by users.	3.0545322104427597
The data base contains several lists, such as a list of ICD codes and diagnoses, a list of all pictures with corresponding diagnoses, a list of all diagnoses and number of picture, a list of those diagnoses for which the corresponding picture is available, as well as a list of comments on each picture.	3.4472920766743367
Special program scripts handle the user's search key words for diagnoses and extract the required information out of the data base, using Windows NT.	3.274179841653442
Search results are presented on an automatically built-up webpage.	3.5930741571016718
To provide fast speed of search all pictures initially are shown in a small format (thumbnails) with little amount of data.	3.1597174531408796
Moreover, the name and institution of the author, diagnostical hints and comments on pictures by the author or by users are offered for each diagnosis available.	2.648886464805002
The Giessen Ophthalmological Picture Atlas can be reached in the Internet.	3.143582903990637
It allows a fast search free of charge from all over the world and, therefore, offers an additional option to obtain specific ophthalmological information for various purposes.	3.161581593092145
Even though the function of the myometrium is vital for the existence of all mammals, there is little knowledge about its ultrastructure.	3.6185561326780755
So far, only the contractile filaments actin and myosin have been identified.	3.2114849029049735
There is no evidence for the existence of other filament systems, either my means of electron microscopy or histochemically.	3.2078971503389235
The indications, operative procedure, postoperative complications and advantages of laparoscopic ileostomy and colostomy as compared with "open" enterostomy are described and demonstrated in our own patients with Crohn's disease.	3.6708506001920655
Major indications for laparoscopic enterostomy in patients with Crohn's disease are stenosis, fecal incontinence and complex anal fistulas in those with severe Crohn's proctitis.	3.4842841127781803
The period of convalescence is much shorter and complications in connection with laparotomy are minimized.	3.4023156529012595
We report on a complete longitudinal rupture of the urethra in combination with a rupture of the pubic symphysis and pelvic fracture during spontaneous vaginal delivery.	3.5961228323994874
Only after stabilisation of the pelvic fracture by external skeletal fixation adaptation of the urethra was possible.	3.644114525541822
Three weeks later after removing of the transurethral catheter a mild stress incontinence could be observed.	2.7925529971484826
In the follow up one year later the patient was completely continent.	4.095141947561783
The cosmetic result was satisfactory.	2.841835091838851
An unclear haematuria after delivery needs a meticulous urological examination.	3.030948281577552
Early repair of urethral disruption minimize the risk of severe incontinence.	3.4740646781061213
Coordinated care between the trauma surgeon and urologist is required for successful treatment of this rare combined injury after birth.	3.5179690628707
The increased consumption of "ecstasy" (MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) has also increased the number of life-threatening intoxications.	3.6315912613851737
From a Medline search of the years 1992-1996, reports were registered and evaluated.	3.2734909180199
Besides cerebral, cardiorespiratory, renal, and hepatic symptoms, hyperthermia syndromes such as malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or the serotonin syndrome were common.	3.1448571201659887
In addition to a discussion of the intoxication symptoms and their acute and intensive-care therapy, the psychological and physiological effects of "ecstasy" will be described.	3.368258022357338
Some historical considerations of the topic are included in this review.	3.4932974162503565
The goal of this prospective, randomised and double-blind pilot-study was to investigate the analgesic potency and the side-effects of tramadol enantiomers in clinical practice.	3.4203277130113037
One hundred patients recovering from orthopaedic surgery with a postoperative pain intensity of more than 50 on a visual analogue scale 0-100 mm (Table 1) were recruited for the study.	3.832525435649068
They were treated in a randomised, double-blind way with a maximal dose of 150 mg i.v.	3.101147272821718
(+)-, (-)-tramadol, racemate, or 15 mg i.v.	2.6939328152368014
morphine or saline in the placebo group (5 groups, 20 patients each).	3.7107527021215887
The primary criterium of efficacy was the number of responders defined as patients with a pain reduction of at least 20 on VAS after 40 min.	3.982238490513573
In case of pain, responders were allowed to continue with the double-blind drug up to six hours.	3.5242589444868444
The non-responders were treated with morphine as the rescue analgesic.	3.5165197171114326
The secondary criterium was the incidence and severity of side-effects.	3.9480813346651304
Six patients terminated the study prematurely.	3.1560325219504026
One patient was excluded because of an allergic reaction to morphine, one patient could not be treated sufficiently with morphine, four were excluded because of protocol violations.	3.4935701364544522
There were 8 responders in the (+)-tramadol-, 6 in the (-)-tramadol- and 6 in the racemate group, 16* (P<0,05) in the morphine group, and 5 in the placebo group.	3.5733543612820737
Pain intensity after 40 min was reduced by 20 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 36 (p<0,01 vs placebo, p<0,05 vs (+)-, (-)-tramadol, and racemate group) and 5 mm on the VAS in the (+)-, (-)-, (+/-)-tramadol-, morphine- and placebo-group, respectively.	2.8683244255541163
Thirty eight adverse events like nausea, vomiting, PCO2-increase, and urinary retention occurred in 20 patients, most frequently in the (+)-tramadol- and morphine group.	3.486272026931642
Sedation was significantly less profound in the (-)-tramadol group 1-4 h postoperatively.	3.523882953660089
There were no side-effect in the tramadol racemate group.	3.315726742867099
The enantiomers were equal to the racemate in analgesic potency, but inferior by far to morphine.	3.285718507524384
They showed more adverse events and, hence, can not be preferred to the racemate in postoperative pain therapy.	3.5885715669588447
A 36-year-old man known as chronic alcohol abuser presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral petriefied kidneys by sonography and computed tomography.	2.8152578131944472
Since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before, a secondary oxalosis was supposed.	3.0266913260726276
The subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of rocket fuel with cola lemonade 12 years before during the patient's army time as a marine soldier.	2.809762006802061
Such fuels contain ethylene glycol (glysantin) as antifreeze commonly known to cause in toxic doses acute renal tubular necrosis with hyperoxaluria.	2.952484270436178
The presented case, however, suggests a rare sublethal ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage, oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure.	3.0403821288294117
Undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the patient died 5 months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure.	4.012285026394744
At autopsy, progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed.	3.0891626756452712
Decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension.	2.9719864303799377
Insulinomas are rare tumors and account for 90 % of all endocrine pancreatic tumors.	3.643984659219582
They typically present as a solitary tumor, but may occur in multiple sites (e.g.	3.5792099389957746
multiple endocrine neoplasia type I) or as a malignant disease in 10 % of cases and rarely as nesidioblastosis or islet cell adenomatosis.	3.883361094037943
Neuroglucopenic symptoms lead to the diagnosis; inadequate high insulin and C-peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the fasting test confirm the diagnosis.	3.4555046773198996
Preoperative localization is not necessary prior to the first operation.	4.643073912044237
The standard operation is enucleation or, depending on size and location, resection.	3.6043660741260046
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia with a high risk of recurrence is problematic.	3.6278587571592804
Subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be better than selective tumor resection.	3.8572844696237354
In malignant insulinomas, mostly presenting with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with hepatectomy and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are the modalities of choice.	3.097450029723331
MR spectroscopy is the only method for non-invasive detection of various aspects of cardiac metabolism in humans.	4.0843883442812166
While the 1H nucleus of water and fat molecules is the signal source for MR imaging, the MR spectroscopic technique allows for the study of a number of other nuclei, such as 13C, 19F, 23Na, 31P, 39K and 87Rb.	3.2313655806299857
Clinical applications presently are confined to the 31P nucleus.	3.0288132489470603
31P-MR spectroscopy allows the non-invasive study of cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolites ATP and phosphocreatine.	3.573710813609228
The phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is considered an index of the energetic state of the heart.	3.4022692961195444
Possible clinical indications include heart failure, valve disease and coronary artery disease.	3.579081749952395
In heart failure, the phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is reduced and correlates with clinical severity, ejection fraction and prognosis.	3.3353489616063
In mitral and aortic valve disease, a reduced phosphocreatine/ATP ratio may indicate the optimum timing for valve replacement.	3.280621386000728
In coronary artery disease, a regional decrease of phosphocreatine during stress ("biochemical ergometry") may indicate local ischemia.	3.365399463707979
Furthermore, absolute quantification of high-energy phosphates may allow diagnosis of myocardial viability.	3.2720902287952454
Major technical developments, leading to improved spatial and temporal resolution will be necessary to establish MR spectroscopy as a routine clinical tool.	3.634297888187627
A retrospective and partly prospective study was conducted to analyse both clinically and cephalometrically the craniofacial growth pattern of patients with isolated and syndrome-related premature craniosynostosis after standardized fronto-orbital and midface advancement.	3.428198376805117
The file data of 293 children with fronto-orbital advancement were evaluated over an average period of 4.4 years.	3.027175508679985
In addition, lateral teleradiographies of 117 patients from this group were cephalometrically analysed.	2.8219592989001367
Moreover, late results of 36 children and  8 adults with midface-advancement with an average follow-up period of 4.5 years were assessed.	3.230385247847175
In contrast to linear craniectomy and so-called lateral canthal advancement, in only 8.2% of cases (24 out of 293 patients) were relapses requiring reoperation found in this study after fronto-orbital advancement.	3.3006763926322975
The evaluations indicate that with simple forms of craniosynostosis such as trigonocephaly and plagiocephaly predominantly very good or good growth can be observed.	2.766970541951935
Cephalometric evaluation confirmed the limited potential of growth in the area of the anterior skull base and in the midface in the presence of syndrome-related faciocraniosynostoses.	4.397508343033537
In such cases the cephalometrically confirmed maxillary hypoplasia, which increases in severity in the following order of syndromes `Saethre-Chotzen-Crouzon-Apert-Pfeiffer', could be influenced only to a limited degree by fronto-orbital advancement.	2.7032728202233205
For this reason midface advancement is of secondary importance in children with very severe anomalies.	3.329599834944934
In the present evaluation, a high rate of relapse of midfacial hypoplasia was to be found in children and adolescents after this operation in accordance with other references.	4.172221466693117
Therefore, the indication for Le Fort III osteotomy in the growth period should be limited.	3.044340736151254
The introduction of Perfluorochemicals into medicine and especially into the treatment of severe lung injury is a fascinating scientific task.	3.4371885689761474
Many recall the famous experiments from Clark et al.	2.7864579923003943
in 1966 when he demonstrated "liquidventilation with perfluorocarbons" in the mammal species for the first time.	2.7973498929003497
After this hallmark, perfluorocarbons were subsequently introduced in research of acute lung injury by the techniques of Total- and Partial-Liquid-Ventilation (TLV; PLV).	2.7665894500235955
Perfluorocarbons (saturated organofluorids) have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for intraalveolar application.	2.8454670347466267
The strong C-F bindings in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability, biochemical inertness, high capacity to dissolve respiratory gases, low surface tension and high vapor pressures.	2.9416585762588947
Furthermore, the high density of the PFC lead to radio-opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas.	2.7960146692040735
The efficacy of PFC liquid, applied by TLV/PLV has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury.	3.0262014659996597
Currently, several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed: recruitment of atelectatic alveoli, prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli ("liquid PEEP"), redistribution of perfusion, oxygen transport, surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation.	3.06686168379832
Since total liquid ventilation has been used only in experimental models of lung injury, partial liquid ventilation has been introduced successfully into clinical trials (phase I-II).	3.5399746485571804
However, the results of the first randomised, controlled study of PLV in 90 adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure (ALI/ARDS) showed no differences between PLV and conventional treatment.	3.8164890916009053
Furthermore, the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as liquithoraces, pneumothoraces and hypoxia.	3.052099241904402
Since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen, the application of liquids, even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic.	3.241756788696369
To overcome these unwanted side effects, we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents.	3.5416653516409213
After resolving some technical issues, this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury.	3.3007556494577837
Vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of 18 Vol.% of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance.	3.0207829261622856
Though these results are promising, mechanisms of action, dose-efficacy relation, surfactant-perfluorocarbon interaction or anti-inflammatory effects of vaporised perfluorohexane are still unclear.	3.1912031750327254
These questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically.	3.8184058508436443
However, the inhalation of vapor, a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space.	2.6286659726349946
Furthermore, this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing, continuous monitoring, and demand application in a way near to clinical routine.	3.4411599353867204
VDD pacing using a single pass lead for complete heart block is well described in adults but there are few reports of its use in children.	3.481224150960132
We have used 6 different standard adult size single pass leads and 5 different pacemaker generators in 21 children and adolescents aged 3.7-17.2 years (mean 9.9 years) and weighing 13.5 to 76 kg (mean 34.3 kg).	2.938523024598689
Congenital complete heart block was present in 14 patients (with associated heart disease in 2 of them), surgical complete heart block in 6 patients and 2:1 AV block of uncertain cause in 1 patient.	3.75287601556715
In 10 patients, the VDD system was their first pacing system.	3.5251382815909293
In 11 of the patients, 1-6 previous systems had been used and simultaneous extraction of ventricular leads (10) and/or atrial leads (5) was performed.	4.450134245768233
All leads were introduced via a subclavian vein puncture (using the extraction sheath when present) and the atrial dipole was placed low in the right atrium to provide slack for further growth while maintaining atrial sensing.	3.3059955674238655
Ventricular thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 V. The minimal atrial amplitude was 0.7 to 4 mV and the maximum amplitude was 2.5 to 8 mV.	2.909442350110379
There was one early micro-displacement and the lead was repositioned.	2.8079986628531812
Over a follow-up period of 2-64 months (mean 32 months), all but 1 of the patients have maintained low ventricular pacing thresholds and adequate atrial signals for reliable pacing at rest and with exercise.	4.09022864545736
During this time some have undergone considerable growth.	3.1564085445907737
One patient with coexisting congenital heart disease died suddenly at 3 years but the pacing system had no fault at autopsy.	2.8985183971737905
The standard adult size single pass lead provides a simple means to enable reliable atrial synchronous ventricular pacing in growing children with complete heart block.	2.941190606660312
Open reduction with internal stabilization is considered to be the standard therapy for the treatment of displaced acetabular fractures.	4.369223155526125
The internal fixation is routinely achieved by the use of plates and screws.	3.801679844756793
The use of cerclage wires and cables as a reduction aid and definitive implant for stabilization has only occasionally been reported in the literature.	2.772391329599202
The indication was mostly limited to use in elderly patients with insufficient bone stock.	3.4789528538604078
A newly instrument developed on the basis of a standard bone elevator is presented.	3.380933866148505
It allows a safe, semiclosed application of a cerclage wire around the greater ischiatic notch through use of the second window of the ilioinguinal approach.	3.2781929464538804
A wide dissection at the "outside" of the pelvis is not necessary.	3.439646956318873
A 35 year old patient developed swellings in the red colored areas of his tattoo.	3.345502159137998
The presence of dermal dendritic cells suggests a dermal-allergic pathogenesis of non-granulomatous tattoo reactions.	3.001985153583212
Therapy of choice is an excision of the inflamed areas.	3.9869617605100793
Interventional duct occlusion is increasingly performed with detachable coils.	3.2861091950451353
In a series of 33 patients (34 procedures), we consistently used Gianturco-coils which were the initially employed coils.	3.2166346425152765
They are not securable but can be implanted in a simple manner.	3.5343983050457575
The rate of embolization was high (28 %) in the first 14 procedures; however, it declined to 5 % in the last 20 patients.	4.074506590552504
We modified the technique by partially blocking the duct, when necessary, with a catheter which was advanced from the pulmonary artery and by implanting up to three coils.	3.734516384784045
There was only one embolization and one small residual shunt in the last 20 patients.	2.8774694883092953
The mean fluoroscopy time in these patients was 11.0  +/-  5.8 minutes and decreased to 7.0  +/-  3.2 minutes in the last 10 patients with successful closure.	4.060682202871409
Considering our experience, we continue to recommend the use of Gianturco-coils especially in the small duct which can be closed quickliy at low cost.	4.1146939912310385
This review presents data supporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in depressive illness.	3.4011675185868167
Neuroanatomical research, animal research and clinical studies have shown that a dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system could be associated with depressive symptoms.	3.8444898771681286
Furthermore, the chronic administration of antidepressants in animals provokes a sensitisation and enhanced expression of dopaminergic receptors.	2.7319021084298587
Although the dopaminergic system has received little attention in biological research on depression in the last decades, current research on the dopaminergic system is about to change this situation.	3.5598141125431777
Athletes who need high endurance capacity often use training at moderately high altitude (1500-3000 m) to improve oxygen delivery and utilization because of a hypoxia-induced increase of the red blood cell volume and adaptations at the muscular level.	3.29783910766941
As maximal heart rates decrease at high altitude and plasma lactate levels for a given workload change during prolonged exposure to high altitude, it can be difficult to control and adapt the intensity and duration of the work-outs.	3.549287293442306
Furthermore, maximal performance capacity decreases and therefore training intensity at high altitude is usually reduced compared to training at sea level.	2.912164361461702
A third option using a hypobaric chamber ("live low - train low") is hardly used anymore for training athletes.	2.8246010454210246
Studies on the effects of conventional high-altitude training for the improvement of athletic performance often lack a rigorous controlled design and yield controversial results.	3.0174908944307863
Regarding the new concept of "live high - train low" there is only one controlled study on college athletes and it shows a minor advantage of this new approach compared to conventional high-altitude training.	3.266477398396666
However, training concepts are especially important for elite competitive athletes, and controlled studies with such individuals are very difficult to perform.	3.397531514386015
Therefore, it appears that today we cannot answer the question of whether altitude-specific physiologic factors or non-altitude-related benefits of training camps account for the success of individual athletes.	3.4626551080976817
Purpose: To answer the following questions: whether reliable detection of lesions is possible in low-field-MRI-system (Magnetom Open 0.2 T) equipped with currently available hard- and software components in comparison to high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T).	3.1547238636449455
Furthermore, whether localization of lesions suspect in MR-mammography can be realized in MR system of low field (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	2.9557913038738746
Patients and Methods: In 11 patients, suspect lesions were diagnosed in diagnostic MR-mammography acquired with high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) and were compared to low field MR-mammographies of 0.2 T (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	2.8387011666154383
In six of the 11 patients a suspect lesion was localized using wire marking.	3.275428458663342
Results: All lesions considered suspect in diagnostic MR-mammography (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) were also clearly identified in the 0.2 T system (Magnetom Open).	2.788297502852949
In six cases wire marking was performed without any complications and with an accuracy of K 0.5 cm distance to the lesion.	3.2109773736595777
Conclusion: Although studies in the 0.2 T system clearly showed inferior SNR (34.6 vs. 83.1) and CNR (14.6 vs. 43.5) compared to studies with the high field system, all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic MR-mammography were reliably identified also in 0.2 T studies.	2.765253379931429
Due to its open construction permitting permanent access to the breast and due to sufficient image quality, the Magnetom Open is suitable for interventions on the breast.	3.179267686306984
Children with limb deficiencies or amputations of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand or to walk according to their state of development, because just standing and walking are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration.	3.5508046466256
Supply them with a prosthesis, orthesis and orthoprosthesis is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation.	3.1911344376777158
While a prosthesis replaces parts of the extremities, orthesis stabilizes the existing extremity.	3.60462030956188
Orthoprostheses compensate longitudinal malformations, have a supporting effect, allow growth to be controlled and compensate for shortening.	3.3993872884401672
Just as important as the remedy is early medical treatment.	3.0915175444846223
The sooner the treatment starts, the better the results.	3.3000506211382885
As a result of the present experiences with the inhalative application of nitric oxide (NO) in term babies now the first promising reports about NO application in preterm babies have been published.	3.1075553600251453
HIV remains infectious at room temperature for about six to twelve hours under sterile conditions, the time is shorter in the presence of bacteria and when clotting occurs.	3.5778369669783303
HIV infectivity is easily destroyed by disinfectants.	3.147235904358352
The human infectious dose of HIV is around 100 to 1000 particles, dependent on the virus and the site of entry into the host.	3.322321610985251
After inoculation new HIV is produced after 24 hours, and HIV has spread over the whole organism by the end of one or two weeks.	3.79488902163761
HIV infection may be detected after four to twelve weeks by antibody assays, and after eleven days by nucleic acid based assays.	3.3808633047553136
Anti-HIV production might be slowed down under initial therapy.	2.8837492509940787
In addition to psychiatric outpatient treatment, the detoxification of alcoholics in psychiatric hospitals is an important link between medical detoxification and psychosocial inpatient treatment aiming at abstinence.	3.169194345036451
Integrated models of inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy focus on improvement of the motivation of patients towards further treatment of their alcoholism and towards abstinence.	3.2507016229438124
In our study 529 alcoholics underwent such treatment lasting between 2 to 3 weeks.	2.8618602983477803
A total of 469 patients (89%) were followed up after 8  months; 242 alcoholics (52% of the follow-up sample; 46% of the whole sample) achieved the treatment goal and started further treatment, mainly as inpatients.	3.3286525445626864
Fifty-four of these patients relapsed before they started further alcoholism treatment, but achieved abstinence afterwards; 60 (25%) of these 242 patients relapsed after the specific alcoholism therapy; 227 alcoholics did not start further treatment after the initial detoxification and motivation therapy.	3.130865450079445
In this subpopulation, 113 (50%) relapsed during the follow-up period.	3.0130065034570177
Although this is not a controlled study, it can be concluded that integrated inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy has positive effects on the treatment behavior of alcoholic patients and enhances the probability of further abstinence.	3.460363951286662
In this article we report a very rare case of simultaneous and bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendon in a 38-year-old patient.	3.111481862666995
Although there was an extensive neurological and psychiatric examination in combination with several operations, it took almost 3 months until the real reason was found.	3.6583941756930782
In this case report we describe our postoperative treatment of early mobilization and compare it with other therapies.	3.032097855031189
They occur sporadically or in association with the MEN I syndrome.	3.3242944085995063
We present five patients (four male, one female; age of first manifestation 19-53 years) who were operated on at our hospital between 1984 and 1995 for neuroendocrine thymic tumors.	3.5249525107851363
A hormone-producing tumor presented with Cushing's syndrome in two patients.	3.1997878992171276
Two patients had MEN I syndrome.	2.5938070885847164
Only in the female patient the primary tumor was confined to the thymus.	3.6762121334684177
We found lymph node metastases in three patients and a distant metastasis in one.	3.774165338065844
Since there was no operative mortality and adjuvant therapies are of limited value, we recommend surgery even in case of recurrence.	4.021562432219256
Korsakoff's psychosis (Wernicke-Korsakoff-Syndrome) following severe, long-term  alcoholism is considered to be widely resistent to treatment.	3.578841949515826
The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was based on the neuroleptical blockade of central dopamine D2 receptors.	3.582972222264451
Brain imaging studies, however, generally failed to demonstrate a significant increase in central D2 receptors among schizophrenic patients.	4.138236766452725
Using a novel approach, the group of Laruelle and Abi-Dargham was now able to demonstrate that schizophrenic patients have increased synaptic dopamine concentrations in the striatum.	3.3112644665831255
Endogenous dopamine competes with a radioligand for binding at dopamine D2 receptors; compared to healthy control subjects, blockade of dopamine production in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients induced a significantly higher increase in D2 binding of the infused radioligand, indicating higher endogenous synaptic dopamine.	2.8363337743561248
A similar increase in D2 binding was also observed in drug-free schizophrenics who had previously been treated with neuroleptics; these patients also showed an increased density of striatal D2 receptors, most likely due to counteradaptive upregulation of D2 receptors during neuroleptic medication.	3.0609778296611
The Columbia study provides an important indication of hyperdopaminergic function in schizophrenia.	3.3804210509902033
Multiple and bilateral oncocytomas are rare.	3.4337635742484394
There are only ten cases that have been previously described.	3.1372536173465875
Three of these displayed multiple and bilateral oncocytomas and microoncocytomas, a so-called oncocytomatosis.	3.1702976297254026
This report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy.	3.4603986381675664
In addition, we found an adrenal adenoma, a pheochromocytoma and thoracic cicatrices 4 years after curatively resected large cell carcinoma of the lung.	3.3758166834270504
In the distal renal tubules we found oncocytic epithelial cells, with partial transition into microoncocytomas.	3.059656669071058
Immunhistochemically, these and the main oncocytomas were CD 10 negative.	3.479124645203217
These findings support the origin of oncocytoma from oncocytically transformed distal tubular epithelium.	2.9746868669339777
CGH analysis of the different tumors revealed no common cytogenetic changes.	4.602225393132768
Coexistence of renal oncocytoma with other tumors is rare.	3.3283139351495725
Hitherto, coexistence of a renal oncocytomatosis with multiple tumors has not been described.	3.305879360318531
Thyroid disorders in childhood needing surgery are rare.	3.5555736156221753
The indications for operation are presented with regard to incidence and type of the defect, and the surgical procedures with regard to the extent of the lesion results.	5.695715376095828
Malignant bone tumors require the same careful staging as, for example, lung cancer.	3.7077170506284225
However, well-established staging systems for non-osseous tumors are not suitable for bone tumors.	3.8414864634533816
Therefore we present Enneking's staging system for malign bone tumors here, which is better adapted to the special problems of these entities because it integrates clinical, radiological and histological findings.	3.503434827826851
The weak points of Enneking's staging system (e.g.	2.8991228073294515
inflexibility, changes in radiological modalities in the past 20 years) are discussed.	4.4901667305431445
Efficient analgesia may be the major objective in the cardiovascular risk patient following myocardial infarction, acute occlusion of peripheral vessels, or dissection/perforation of major abdominal vessels.	3.5777482368230515
It was the purpose of the study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight different opioids in 57 circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular surgery.	4.1292941196320205
Patients were randomly allocated to eight groups, each receiving a different opioid within a clinical, equipotent dose range (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, pethidine, tramadol, alfentanil).	2.8369668000390265
A complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to as well as 5, 10, 15, and 20 min following opioid administration.	3.6456373024522972
Monitoring included a complete invasive haemodynamic and blood gas status.	3.1065857004439077
Significant time effects (changes from baseline at the time of measurement) were observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance, while significant group (group-specific differences in the course of values at the different times of measurements) and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, stroke volume index, and PaO2.	3.779313190442885
No major effects were observed following morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, tramadol, and nalbuphine.	3.571025416975582
Buprenorphine caused distinct respiratory depression accompanied by an increase in pulmonary vascular tone.	3.6961515300691516
Pentazocine and pethidine caused a significant increase in MPAP and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine also produced marked respiratory depression.	3.2372215014529253
For interpretation of the results, factors such as respiratory depression, histamine release, secretion of endogenous catecholamines, and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have to be discussed.	3.499654530853695
Tramadol, an opioid with moderate potency, seems to offer some advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects.	3.2707402445580898
In this article we report a case of an early postoperative compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial compartment with complete sensomotoric palsy of the peroneal nerve after arthroscopic-assisted replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee.	3.43690637133377
The tourniquet pressure was 360 mm Hg and operation time was 1.75 h. After the operation the leg was bandaged to avoid swelling of the leg and as antithrombotic prophylaxis.	3.469785943974917
Analgesic therapy was by continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion.	3.522176889009716
Increasing pain of the lower leg was suppressed by additional analgesia.	4.119019743837842
Due to persistent pain despite regular analgesia, the patient was sent to a main hospital on the 3rd postoperative day, where an extremely painful and swollen anterior tibial compartment with intracompartimental pressure of over 100 mm Hg was found.	3.377438111164728
The compartment was released immediately.	3.4594328186406287
Despite the appearance of severe muscle damage, no extensive débridement was done.	3.593092801315221
At the second examination, at 48 h, there was minimal perfusion of the muscles without contraction and islands of ischemic necrosis.	3.474856783942546
Clinically, there was complete palsy of the dorsiflexors of the foot.	3.4714267209404848
The case shows the danger of a compartment syndrome when tourniquet of the limb, arthroscopy and a firm bandage are combined.	3.18498714959463
Continuous epidural analgesia masks the classic symptoms of compartment syndrome.	3.0689547351878943
The influence of biomechanics in surgery of the locomotor apparatus has been constantly increasing over the last few decades.	3.074063522491704
The purpose of this study was to determine wether biomechanical studies can significantly influence therapy and treatment of shoulder injuries, especially shoulder instability.	3.0606896003753037
The investigation was performed on 23 fresh human specimens with intact capsular ligaments of the glenohumeral joint.	2.9474946663136774
A Bankart lesion from 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock was repaired, and a Bankart repair and anterior inferior capsular shift, as described by Neer, were performed.	3.255004206701626
The measurement was done on six clinically relevant positions of instability: superior, anterior, anterior-inferior, inferior, posterior-inferior, posterior.	3.168524846108218
Measurement was done using a specially developed strain-gauge system.	3.2679454857340637
It was demonstrated that both instability and too much stability of the shoulder joint lead to a significant change in shoulder biomechanics.	3.82775301315863
The anatomical 0-position of the glenohumeral joint in 110  ° of abduction is a position of about 60  ° of external rotation compared to the 0-position for clinical measurement.	3.7096484582718054
From the therapy point of view, one has to ask for anatomical reconstruction instead of tight repair in soft-tissue repair in the glenohumeral joint.	3.101813886119516
Immediate post-operative rehabilitation in a 60  ° range of motion is possible.	4.002551850628398
A total of 61 patients suffering from weight loss and epigastric pain were screened by color flow Duplex imaging (CFDJ) of the abdominal vessels.	3.5509238734382977
Criteria for diagnosis were (1) peak flow in the celiac axis (CA) of more than 200 cm/s; (2) fixing of the CA stenosis during expiration and inspiration, and (3) steal phenomenon and reversal of flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).	3.7650831337036603
Results: Of 61 patients 21 (34.4%) fulfilled the criteria; 38 (62.3%) were excluded, and 2 patients could not be evaluated.	3.332127311211688
Of 21 patients 10 were operated on after confirming diagnosis by angiography of CA and SMA.	3.17624805368556
After a follow-up of 28 months 80% of the operated patients were free of symptoms, 10% improved, and 10% showed no change.	4.288173376741165
Conclusion: Successful operative treatment of CA compression includes (1) CFDJ of CA and SMA proving stenosis persisting in inspirational position of the diaphragm; (2) angiography of CA and SMA showing a steal phenomenon including blood flow reversal in SMA; (3) triad of symptoms: epigastric pain, postprandial pain and weight loss; and (4) exclusion of other causes, i.e.	3.3453381057020413
pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis etc.	3.785927636907789
Extremely radical and radical surgical treatment of breast cancer was investigated with regard to indication, prognosis and local recurrence in comparison to current standard breast-conserving procedures.	4.588440937093181
Plastic-reconstructive techniques and innovative therapeutical approaches such as preoperative chemotherapy can extend the indications for breast-conserving therapy without loss of oncological safety.	3.316171034663176
Choosing individually various oncoplastic techniques such as glandular adaptation, local or distant flaps or mammoplasty permits breast remodeling with excellent cosmetic results.	2.8351212888981108
We present the variety of intraglandular techniques and local flaps that enable the breast surgeon to achieve good symmetry and breast shape with minimal surgery and scarring.	3.0737211234109116
Lesions detected in the white matter by T2-weighted MRI are often inadvertently attributed to multiple sclerosis (MS).	3.150467434898745
Patients with rheumatic diseases are commonly treated as an outpatient in their local environment or are referred to specialized centers.	3.3491543101235823
Two recently founded daypatient clinics in Berlin and Frankfurt/Rhein-Main (Germany) for patients suffering from rheumatic diseases will be evaluated for their medical outcome and cost-effectivness of comprehensive treatment of RA patients in stages of high inflammatory activity and progressive disability.	3.1895602882698637
The study design will be prospective, controlled, and randomized to compare outpatient and daypatient treatment.	2.850933369811254
The case-control study design with matched pairs within the network of collaborative arthritis centers will be used to compare daypatient and inpatient treatment.	2.8687650270746925
The paper contains a review of studies published in English or German language dealing with daypatient treatment of RA patients.	3.1099591837213287
A case of atrial ectopic tachycardia in an infant probably caused by a small tumor in the interatrial septum is presented.	3.331154139058459
The arrhythmia was successfully treated with amiodarone.	3.712695402128605
Several histologic abnormalities are known to cause AET, but an intracardiac tumor detectable by two-dimensional echocardiography is extremely rare.	3.3281563935390532
AET - especially in childhood - as well as cardiac tumors show a tendency to regression, so that even in this case medical treatment should be the first therapeutic choice.	4.871438109077091
Interventional or surgical treatment is required just for those patients with AET that is resistant to medical treatment or reoccurs after finishing the medical treatment.	3.6409617740664455
Tonsure trichotillomania is a subtype of trichotillomania in which the scalp exhibits a tonsural pattern of alopecia over the crown, extending to the frontal margin and sparing the lateral margins and the nape of the neck.	3.332639436923543
It differs from to the more common form of childhood trichotillomania in that predominantly female adolescents are affected and its incidence is related to quite severely pathologic psychodynamics, often with a disturbed relationship to female sexuality.	3.0661833612013965
The treating physician should be more guarded in assessing the prognosis; hair plucking often continues for years.	3.0990355103997627
Two patients with tonsure alopecia, associated in one case with trichotillomania of the pubic hair and in the other with enuresis, are presented.	3.7562569814577302
The aim of the following study was to develop an osteoporotic model by means of ovariectomy.	4.066922550452119
Bone mineral density of the upper and lower jaw was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DPX) before and after ovariectomy.	3.3012447801165887
Histomorphometric measurements were done by a microtomography system.	3.834857908045799
Bone mineral density decreased significantly after ovariectomy in the upper and lower jaw.	3.338447280507058
There is evidence for the community effectiveness of preventive geriatric intervention programs prior to the need for help or long-term care from a couple of prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs).	3.4803989949314484
For geriatric rehabilitation programs tailored to older people with imminent or manifest need for long-term care analogous - evidence is still lacking.	3.13839778773486
The nation-wide leading boards of the FRG's Sickness Insurance Administration in conjunction with its Central Medical Service have formulated guidelines for the formation of a nation-wide ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to realize the postulate of the long-term care insurance legislation "rehabilitation prior to long-term care".	3.0494438760164813
These guidelines must be proven empirically.	3.335095548101971
To prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the foreseen ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service, the RCT design would be highly desirable.	3.119165151572364
Unfortunately, the prerequisites in the field of methodology are poor since valid, reproducible and feasible criteria for the selection of suitable patients and measurement criteria which meet the requirement of proven medium-term sensitivity to change do not yet exist.	3.339392248449683
Nevertheless, there is a great and urgent need, for the first time, to investigate the cost-effectiveness ratio for this ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to be established in the FRG, leaving aside the methodologic desiderata of randomized control-groups.	3.477271941437247
The underlying reasons and mechanisms of "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardias are still not completely understood.	3.1842746123401766
Recent investigations showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the right ventricle of patients with "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia out of the right ventricular outflow tract, which could often be correlated with the origin of the ventricular tachycardia.	5.03694874545957
These described abnormalities were not uniform.	3.4809342462991464
This is the first report in which the origin of an "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia could be localized by right-ventricular angiography, magnetic resonance tomography and electrophysiological study in the area of an interventricular septal thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract and cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation.	3.7560060568596643
Fetal teratomas are extra- or intracorporal congenital malformations with different localization.	3.043334453064884
Although they are rare, they may provoke severe obstetrical complications if they are not prenatally diagnosed.	3.6855375609698533
If sonographic examination of fetal teratomas is performed, it is necessary to evaluate the further development of pregnancy for fetal outcome and pregnancy aspects in relationship to the localization, size and ultrasound criteria of the tumor.	3.9956198598726718
Sonographic findings reveal the criteria and conditions for conservative or invasive management or reasons for continuing or terminating the pregnancy.	3.148824836429964
Prenatal ultrasound examination is the only possibility to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, as exemplified by 8 prenatally examined fetal teratomas.	3.6290346616960614
We report on a 62-year-old female patient with melena in which polypoid lesions of the cecum were discovered endoscopically.	2.975174446717682
Histological examination of mucosal biopsies revealed an inflammatory process with lots of histiocytes and so-called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, leading to the diagnosis of a malakoplakia of the colon.	3.3767414655400674
No other organs were found affected.	3.325174571979433
In the course of an antibiotic therapy, there was no melena detectable over a period of six months.	3.8183611210096133
Malakoplakia, an inflammation usually affecting the urogenital tract, is rarely found in the colon, with only 35 cases published until now.	3.8451135940304804
It is frequently associated with other diseases like neoplastic or inflammatory disorders, immune defect syndromes or heroin abuse.	3.0390116547295953
This spectrum is expanded by our report in which a long-standing alcohol abuse was found as an attendant disease.	3.7295662268305287
Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem a (ULE) is a self-limited, probably infectious-allergic skin disease predominately affecting small children.	3.4671396122079465
We describe five such cases.	3.1773367041809046
The typical unilaterally located or at least unilaterally dominant exanthem usually starts in the axillary region and is characterized by red, partly confluent papules and fine scales.	3.078771411713762
Two of the children presented with atypical manifestations of ULE.	3.2714221352442214
Due to its asymptomatic course, therapy is not necessary in the majority of cases.	4.280471082193722
Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is now an accepted alternative to conventional adrenalectomy.	3.356443367772163
As in open surgery, several different endoscopic approaches to the adrenal glands have been described.	3.314886802973405
All adrenal tumors - pheochromocytomas included - except adrenal carcinomas can be removed endoscopically.	2.8475299961019696
However, the use of these techniques is limited in patients with particularly large tumors.	4.676087952760993
The results reported to date are convincing.	3.4809066555343025
Only limited data are available as yet to compare conventional and endoscopic adrenalectomy.	3.6293981848091157
Because adrenal diseases requiring surgery are rare, endoscopic adrenalectomy is an operation that, for the present, will be limited to centers with a particular interest in laparoscopic and endocrine surgery.	3.933345365329259
Economic evaluations have become more and more important in the somatotherapeutic field.	3.611234055510041
This survey's objective was to examine if the current economic evaluation techniques can be applied to psychotherapy.	3.8452008151746595
21 studies were found: 16 cost- benefit analyses, 4 cost-effectiveness analyses and one cost-utility analysis.	3.345849789573023
The quality of the representation of the clinical results (mean value 8.6) was better than that of the economic results (mean value 6.1).	3.386290409392626
It was perfectly possible to evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions with regard to economic aspects by means of the current techniques but in most cases there was a considerable lack of quality in both representation and calculation.	4.190377962144559
Furthermore the evaluation type of cost-utility analysis, which is the only one that takes quality of life aspects into consideration and therewith seems to be the most appropriate approach regarding the psychotherapeutic field, has been greatly ignored.	3.909072888269865
As a net effect of ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) cardioprotection due to vasodilative (reduction of blood pressure, afterload reduction), antiproliferative (reduced cell growth, reduction of "vascular" andor "ventricular remodeling", reduced formation of extracellular matrix), as well as antiadrenergic actions and due to the stimulating effect on natriuresis, reduction of blood pressure, preload reduction can be expected.	3.2271613793748983
These aims of therapy have mostly been confirmed for the action of ACE-inhibitors by experimental and clinical studies but except for the treatment of arterial hypertension and few preliminary reports concerning the treatment of cardiac dysfunction, no comparable data are available for AT1-receptor antagonists.	4.012159884682871
To date, an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic action could only be demonstrated for ACE-inhibitors.	3.2928342693855512
This effect has been discussed to be responsible for the improvement of long-term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease.	4.247587077818234
Despite the similar spectrum of action there exist important differences between ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists that might underline the need of an individual use of these drugs: the dual action of ACE-inhibitors on the RAS and the kinin system bears many benefits but has been also shown to be accompanied by side-effects, mainly chronic dry cough, in a relatively high percentage of patients thus leading to discontinuation of therapy in 8-14%.	3.3241052785905336
This respective side-effect can be prevented by the use of AT1-receptor antagonists.	3.9914918952135876
It has been discussed whether the incomplete action of ACE-inhibitors on AT1-receptor-mediated effects is at least in part responsible for the efficacy of this drug which is relatively high (75-80%) as compared to other substances.	3.919500359329566
Due to their direct action, AT1-receptor-blockers might also be of high effectiveness for the treatment of severe heart failure.	3.4104230891920655
A combination of the ACE-inhibitor-mediated activation of the kinin-system with the more specific blockade of AT1-receptors by AT1-receptor antagonists might be of benefit and is currently under investigation.	3.1838737744401913
Finally, it has been discussed that the incresed AT II concentration in case of AT1-receptor-blockade activates AT2-receptor-mediated mechanisms thus leading to an additive vasoprotective effect.	3.4577234724766313
An isomorphic response is defined as a nonspecific skin stimulus eliciting a disease-specific skin reaction.	3.267248679503509
We report on the development of the Koebner phenomenon in a 32 year old patient with psoriasis after skin testing with UVB at a dose above 0,055 J/cm2.	3.4315582066908683
In addition we describe a 28 years old patient who developed new psoriatic plaques in the areas affected by the virus after a varicella infection.	3.5685864600775927
The presence of nicotine in sweat obtained from smokers and one non-smoker exposed to tobacco smoke after 4 h to 8 days of nicotine-free time was investigated.	2.7289557170336627
Following stimulation of the eccrine glands, sweat samples were taken every hour for 6 h.The total nicotine concentrations, i.e.	3.2111008289841094
the sum of nicotine and its metabolites, were determined by radioimmunoassay.	3.5177344645954443
The presence of unchanged nicotine was revealed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.	2.881944986162472
Up to now there is no specific treatment targeting the ultimate cause of interstitial cystitis (IC), since its pathogenesis and etiology are still unknown.	3.0944107488344117
Most studies focussing on oral medication have not been randomized, double-blinded or placebo-controlled.	3.6712569111015445
Numerous case reports and intent-to-treat trials are lacking a systematic approach and do not meet evidence-based medicine criteria.	3.559178176558592
Consequently there is as yet no standard oral therapy available for the treatment of IC.	3.847864895321682
Differential radiomodification induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is proving to be a feasible modality for optimizing tumor radiotherapy.	3.9508032991378745
Our earlier work on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells has shown that pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives increases the uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG.	2.98142202910514
Moreover, the alteration induced in bioenergetic profile was more drastic and less reversible.	2.818838046391675
The promising combination of hematoporphyrin derivatives and 2-DG has been further evaluated in the Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice for determining the effects on radiotherapeutic response.	3.3599148451562186
Solid tumors (average volume = 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm3) implanted in Swiss-albino strain "A" mice were focally irradiated (10 Gy) using 60Co teletherapy.	2.928896827556882
Tumor bioenergetics was assessed by 31P MR spectroscopy.	3.693986752807926
The uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG was observed to be increased following pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives.	3.2400830167462518
Upon hematoporphyrin derivatives + 2-DG treatment followed by irridiation, the intracellular pH reduced and a remarkable increase in glycerophosphorylcholine and inorganic phosphate levels was observed.	2.9634071768792323
The present study demonstrates the potential of hematoporphyrin derivative pretreatment in increasing the bioavailability of 2-DG in a mice Ehrlich ascites tumor model.	3.13002297534429
The finding may have interesting clinical implications in the form of increased manifestation of the radiation-induced damage in the case of use of these drugs as a potential adjuvant in radiotherapy of tumors.	4.030826389583145
The novel Lenz (1835) by the German author, social revolutionist and physician Georg Büchner (1813-1837) can be regarded as a prominent document in the history of medicine.	3.068358676667976
On the one hand, Büchner's description of a schizophrenic disorder meets recent criteria; on the other, he hints at the physician's modern general attitude toward the patient.	3.315787666946333
The latter is derived from his philosophy of art and political motives.	2.856793111432277
The hypothesis is discussed that a dysfunction of the descending antinociceptive system may underly the pain of fibromyalgia.	3.33758424558242
Data from animal experimentation show that an interruption of the system by spinal cord cooling leads to (1) increase in ongoing activity,  (2) lowering in stimulation threshold, and (3) increase in response magnitude in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons.	3.56989681263684
The influence of the descending system was stronger on the responses to input from deep nociceptors than to input from cutaneous nociceptors.	2.965422534967736
If similar changes occur also in patients, an impairment of the tonicly active descending system should be followed by (1) spontaneous pain (ongoing activity), (2) tenderness (lowering in mechanical threshold), and (3) hyperalgesia (increased responses to noxious stimuli).	3.774001090108701
These changes should affect mainly deep pain, because the antinociceptive system influences predominantly input from deep nociceptors.	3.0273613016825265
Animal experiments with microbiologic examinations and studies in cell cultures have shown that ionomer cement is a biocompatible and biostable bone replacement material in the head and neck region.	2.9922004577296835
Clinical and functional results of its use in the human middle ear have proven to be satisfactory during a maximal period of 2.5 years observation.	3.5026725604216966
The present trial was continued in order to determine the long-term behavior of ionomer cement (Ionos partial and total ossicles) after reconstruction of the ossicular chain.	3.941301439989316
The ossicular chain was reconstructed in 343 cases and included various losses of one or more of the ossicles (i.e., incus, incus and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure, and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure).	2.781320488325685
Follow-up extended over a maximum period of 5.5 years.	2.881719361798719
Patients were examined under a surgical microscope and a pure-tone audiogram was performed at regular intervals.	3.151806671228682
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not presently performed in Germany.	3.1875869218432324
According to PGD's opponents there, existing laws for the protection of embryos forbid this type of diagnostics.	3.0639094768667428
Proponents feel that these laws do not stand in the way of PGD, depending on legal viewpoint.	3.223324973704871
This controversy has hindered PGD's application in Germany.	3.103200673311468
The nature of this longstanding, emotional discussion is not easy to describe to scientists abroad.	3.0807783480369535
This retrospective study investigated the stability of the small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration used in the treatment of 42 mostly unstable distal radius fractures (types A-3.2, C-1.2 and C-2.1 according to the AO classification).	3.31740037907414
No bone grafting was performed.	3.578992077081481
All cases were documented with antero-posterior and lateral X-rays preoperatively, 0, 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively and after consolidation.	3.8833362702610743
Early functional aftertreatment was started one week after surgery.	3.3048283716588327
The mean preoperative radial angle of 17 ° was normalized to 25 ° postoperatively.	2.7932460024861543
The mean preoperative volar angle of minus 30 ° was reduced to 12 ° postoperatively.	2.956870853716674
None of these mean angles changed until consolidation.	2.808198375989406
The small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration proved to be stable enough for early functional aftertreatment of the wrist.	2.7648612697366257
Its stability is related to a proper operative technique and correct indication (unstable Colles type with one or two distal fragments).	3.431419208542315
Bone grafting is unnecessary if the external fixator is left in situ until bony consolidation.	3.2406868670361058
Purpose: To develop and implement a method to obtain digital subtraction (DS) spiral computed tomography angiograms (SCTA) in order to avoid superimposition of bony structures and vascular calcifications on SCTA maximum intensity projections (MIPs) and shaded surface display (SSD).	2.82462897994689
The concept of small-volume resuscitation, the rapid infusion of a small volume (4 ml/kg BW) of hyperosmolar 7.2-7.5% saline solution for the initial therapy of severe hypovolemia and shock was advocated more than a decade ago.	3.384403415646232
Numerous publications have established that hyperosmolar saline solution can restore arterial blood pressure, cardiac index and oxygen delivery as well as organ perfusion to pre-shock values.	3.905018499915531
Most prehospital studies failed to yield conclusive results with respect to a reduction in overall mortality.	4.03077472345709
Moreover, small-volume resuscitation appears to be of specific impact in patients suffering from head injuries with increased ICP and in severest trauma requiring immediate surgical intervention.	3.645359753233614
The utility of electron beam computed tomography (EBT) to estimate cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated.	3.401921306007359
Eleven patients with suspected acute cerebral ischemia were investigated.	3.3414801430258554
The EBT was performed with an acquisition time of 50 ms per slice at eight parallel levels.	3.3851528510927142
To compare signal/noise and contrast/ noise ratios the data from the EBT investigation were compared to a similar examination on a spiral CT.	3.597556325623012
The signal/noise ratio with EBT was about 30%, the contrast/noise ratio 25% of that with spiral CT.	3.423051938595216
The absolute values of CBV were 4.9 +/- 1.2 ml/100 g (EBT); CBF was 50.5 +/- 7.0 ml/100 g/min in normal contralateral brain tissue.	3.0082338897359975
In four patients with proven infarcts on follow-up, the ischemic areas had a CBV ranging from 1.7 to 3.8 ml/100 g, while CBF ranged from 9.4 to 24.5 ml/100 g/min.	2.894457209183602
Advantages of EBT are the absolute measurements possible and it's multislice capability.	3.014390606609583
Disadvantages, however, are caused by the high image noise, limiting the demarcation of ischemic tissue.	4.22211066995312
The report, in two parts, sums up the findings of a survey covering 52 cities in Central Europe.	3.418084539537806
Most administrations have imposed a ban on feeding street pigeons, but this has been more or less unsuccessful.	3.223637397880045
Information campaigns were used on a large scale, along with more controversial methods such as catching the birds or shooting them down, providing pigeon houses, administering hormone preparations, chemosterilization, and exclusion from buildings.	2.7876754356175693
Few attempts were made to reduce the number of breeding places.	4.064741267417374
Population reduction by poisons or natural enemies seems to be negligible.	3.4614056990651263
We report a rare case of an accident during which a pedestrian was hit by a car and was thrown through the windscreen into the front seat.	2.919314250713827
Apart from the high speed (100 km/h or more) the traumatic amputation of both lower legs and the resulting reduced angular momentum mainly contributed to the final position of the pedestrian in the vehicle.	3.318587904961791
In addition, the low height of the person standing in front of the vehicle is deemed to have been a supporting factor for the course of the accident.	3.5258386253608465
A 41-year-old woman with severe juvenile diabetes mellitus suffered from profund hypothermia after loss of thermoregulation in diabetic ketoacidosis.	2.7335900504055664
She was found unconscious, without measurable blood pressure; the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed bradycardia of 30/min and the rectal temperature was 23.7  °C.	3.128519630781612
The patient received mechanical ventilation, fluid therapy, warmed gastric lavage, and, unfortunately, inotropic medication.	3.1470511359992743
She was transferred to a department of cardiac surgery in order to continue the therapy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	3.5351434925839
On arrival, the patient had a rectal temperature of 27.3  °C, the ECG showed an absolute arrhythmia with a frequency of 70/min, and the blood pressure was 63/43 mm Hg.	4.567083154357915
We decided to use a rapidly available but not highly invasive venovenous hemofiltration technique for slowly rewarming the patient.	3.0593337127419753
Vascular access was achieved by percutaneous femoral vein cannulation with a Shaldon catheter.	3.3655518473515995
The hemofiltration system (Gambro AK-10, Gambro AB, Sweden) was instituted with a blood flow rate of 200 ml/min.	3.2224275865114977
The hemofiltration monitor controls the pumps for filtering and substituting fluid volumes and allows the infusion solutions to be heated up to 40  °C.	2.827441282609448
After treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia, she was discharged from the intensive care unit to complete treatment with no evidence of any permanent organ damage.	3.471546104296888
We conclude that hemofiltration may be the method of choice for rewarming deeply hypothermic patients when their circulation is preserved.	3.1693158802128982
Under these circumstances, it is preferable to external rewarming techniques, as it avoids the disadvantages of temperature afterdrop and rewarming shock.	3.7630402060886237
Rewarming rates of 1.5  °C/h seem to be adequate.	3.5717729795652495
Hemofiltration systems are more widespread, less invasive, and easier to handle compared to CPB techniques, which should be preferred in situations of prolonged unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation with cardiac arrest and deep core temperatures.	3.5075214968507904
Due to the shot-like force of the spoke, the left nostril, septum and right wall of the nasal cavity were pierced.	3.1467281796959727
The part with the joint penetrated into the maxillary antrum.	3.1937358869808428
In order to remove the spoke, wire scissors had to be used to cuff off the spoke's joint inside the surgically opened maxillary sinus.	3.488563556799626
Seven patients with pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma were treated with inhalation therapy with 36 million IU interleukin-2 for six months.	3.819837329501391
Inhalation therapy was combined with four bolus infusions of DTIC at a dose of 850 mg/m2 once every four weeks.	3.5263863242730924
Response rates were 71,4% with 2 patients achieving a complete remission (CR), 2 partial remissions (PR), 1 stable disease (SD), and 2 progressing disease (PD).	3.728712122404676
Therapy was well tolerated with low toxicity.	3.4730268154978363
Six of the patients developed cough; one patient was slightly feverish.	4.230336096366088
Twelve patients with extensive lichen planus, resistant to different regimes of prior external and internal therapy, were treated with PUVA-bath photochemotherapy (psoralen bath followed by UVA irradiation) using bath water containing 0,5 mg/L of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP).	3.177865471383302
In 11 of the 12 patients, the skin lesions showed a significant improvement or even complete remission within six weeks of treatment.	3.8025992396373023
In one patient, only limited clinical improvement could be achieved.	3.522914393475169
A mean of 19,1 (SD +/- 3,6) PUVA-bath treatments were carried out.	3.5891048417067135
The mean cumulative UVA-dose given until clearance of the lichen planus was 16,7 (SD +/- 4,8) J/cm2.	3.4092061948203676
No side effects were seen except an increased phototoxic reaction in two patients manifested as slight erythema.	3.1585090079270066
The results of this trial show, that PUVA-bath photochemotherapy with 8-MOP is an effective therapeutic alternative to all other known therapies in the treatment of extensive, exanthematic and also hypertrophic-hyperkeratotic lichen planus.	3.224183713694591
In comparison to oral PUVA therapy and PUVA-bath therapy using 4,5',8-trimethoxypsoralen, balneophotochemotherapy with 8-MOP shows an excellent efficiency-side effect correlation.	2.8909443467794587
The clearance of the refractive skin lesions by balneophotochemotherapy with 8-MOP demonstrates the superiority of this therapy over all other common therapeutic modalities used for lichen planus.	2.88229569137846
Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) may occur in up to 70% of septic patients and multiple organ failure patients.	4.087763994650717
Typical clinical signs of CIP are the difficulty to wean the patient from artificial respiration, a symmetrical flaccid quadriparesis/-plegia that is more pronounced in the distal parts of the limbs, reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes, and muscular atrophy.	3.2898891713317853
The data available in the literature were reviewed and compared to our own findings in order to deduce a clinical definition of CIP.	4.430474886407309
It is a particular aim of this work to emphasize the crucial importance of electrophysiological investigation and monitoring in the classification of the nature and extent of neuromuscular disturbances in critically ill patients.	3.5728793881449397
Myths about development during midlife are examined in the light of recent research studies.	3.4077444396537637
These studies show clearly, that midlife is a developmental phase of its own, the course of which can only slightly be predicted by previous development.	3.5163488700314742
The assumption of a depressive crisis automatically occuring must be rejected as well as "positive myths" denying the evolving limitations in certain areas of life.	3.221066973549957
Developmental tasks and developmental possibilities are described as well as the clinical concept of a phase-specific "return of the repressed".	4.093487371396191
Possibilities of councelling and psychotherapy with couples during midlife are outlined.	2.8750894625658776
The general aspects for the analysis of malalignment of the low tibial region in the three-dimensional space are discussed.	3.697882899238188
Recommendations for clinical and radiological diagnostics prior to low tibial osteotomies are given.	3.356936775124813
Closing wedge, opening wedge, dome-shaped, distraction, rotational and step-shaped osteotomies as well as combined procedures are described.	3.57547182779952
The possibilities of these techniques are pointed out for malalignment after lower leg, pilon and ankle fractures, as well as after trauma of the distal epiphysis of the tibia.	3.8891075137605084
Arthroscopy of the ankle is an additional tool for detailed planning of the adequate surgical procedure.	3.8980530855533573
The importance of determining an early correction cannot be underestimated.	2.790015131376211
The original reason for using the German "Habilitation" degree to mean that a candidade had qualified and could conduct research and teach at a university is no longer really valid, as this is being threatened by its importance to further careers.	3.0476207932709647
Medical faculties must discuss how this development can be curtailed.	3.194748066254152
In order to check the current situation, the Habilitation degree systems of 36 medical faculties of German universities were compared with the aid of a scoring system.	3.2263399889308118
Conformity existed only in the demand for a doctoral dissertation, scientific publications and a lecture on approval.	3.1875065670001996
Concerning other criteria for qualification there was decreasing consensus in the following order: Habilitation thesis, commitment to teaching, further professional education, participation in congresses, inaugural lecture, qualification to teach, scientific activity, broad background in the discipline, and introduction to the faculty.	2.7495635515998234
Application of the scoring system with a maximum of 33 score points resulted in a mean value of 15.2 points and a range from 6 to 29 points.	3.730812409650443
A significant decrease in the score values occurred with increasing age of the Habilitation degree (P = 0.002).	3.189517739545133
Presuming that the German Habilitation degree should be maintained as a high-level qualification, we developed proposals that might be used to standardize this academic examination.	3.921022150258504
Chronic reduction in uteroplacental blood flow causes intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).	2.9503669863835302
In an animal model fetal umbilical perfusion in experimentally induced IUGR was examined.	2.824943852487013
Pregnant sheep were instrumented with externally adjustable occluders on the common internal iliac artery to regulate uterine blood flow in the last third of gestation.	3.2794966226300573
Flow probes on the uterine arteries and the common umbilical artery provided blood flow measurements.	3.2584324191634564
Uterine blood flow was restricted in the group destined to become growth retarded whereas uterine blood flow in the equally instrumented controls was allowed to rise normally.	3.3031145609433064
When the experiment was terminated and morphometric data were obtained, uterine blood flow in controls was significantly higher than in restricted animals.	3.210676488652213
Body weight and ponderal index in fetuses of flow-restricted mothers was significantly lower than in controls.	3.415991739802433
The relation between uterine and umbilical blood flow became closer with advancing gestational age.	2.60969580260699
Chronic reduction of uterine blood flow in late pregnant sheep causes IUGR accompanied by changes in umbilical blood flow which may be due to fetal adaptation.	3.3030445607019585
Four hundred and eighty-eight radical retropubic prostatectomies (RRP) were performed on clinically localized prostate cancer at one institution within 5 years (1992-1996).	3.106953541097881
These were then analyzed regarding the migration of pathological tumor stages towards more localized stages.	2.8520850852915367
Within the observation period, the annual rate of RRP increased by 81 % from 69 to 125 cases.	3.04625749815122
The authors noted a decline in the occurrence of advanced tumor stages (65.0 % to 39.2 %) and small cancers ( < 0.5 cc: 7.2 % to 1.6 %) and an increase in pathological T2 tumors (30.4 % to 55.2 %).	3.1283608663759135
The rate of positive surgical margins declined from 34.7 % to 12.8 % (for all pathological stages).	2.716473215341174
These data confirm trends which were observed in the USA with increasing detection and treatment of localized prostate cancer.	4.358793622380702
Prognostic assessment of acute global cerebral anoxia following cardiorespiratory arrest requiresa high level of clinical and technical diagnostic skills.	3.3746606215280943
Statements regarding prognosis of this form of coma can be made only with reference toa large number of clinical, neurophysiological, biochemical, and cerebral imaging data.	3.7289015904249325
Previous research in this field has usually been restricted to only one or a few parameters such as clinical data, EEG findings, evoked potentials or biochemical markers.	3.2693140430015326
The present compilation of the various aspects regarding diagnosis and prognosis is intended to define the present state of the art in diagnosis and prognosis of anoxic coma, and also serve as a basis for a multicenter prospective study including all of the relevant data to improve diagnosis and arrive at guidelines for effective prognostication of anoxic coma.	3.675522576154586
In 96 patients (ductal pancreatic carcinoma, n = 34; periampullary carcinoma, n = 43; chronic pancreatitis, n = 19) the role of CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of lesions of the head of the pancreas were evaluated.	4.164775418344136
The sensitivity for ductal pancreatic carcinoma was 73.3 %, for periampullary carcinoma 48.8 %, and specificity was 63.2 %.	3.098085665687094
Carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated only in every fifth patient.	3.575090600145832
Even when combining the two tumor markers no increase in sensitivity could be observed.	2.9008803755992183
The low specificity of 63 %, which decreased to 33 % in the case of obstructive jaundice, does not allow adequate preoperative differentiation between cancer patients and those with chronic pancreatitis.	3.738884765259771
In cases of postoperatively elevated CA 19-9 level the prognosis is worse than in patients with normal tumor markers.	3.512244531603277
The management of neuromuscular foot deformities in children and adolescents must be individualized because of differences in etiology and pathomechanics.	3.105462367621462
Early postoperative mobilisation is usually possible provided adequate orthotic control is maintained.	3.1074033415469176
Regular clinical follow-ups help to minimize postoperative problems.	3.5144980259504512
The general aim should be an optimization of functions and only rarely to achieve a normal foot.	3.677426943802463
The basic principles of management can be described as correction of deformity, stabilization of unstable joints and balance of muscle power.	3.5642788044369063
This study was carried out from 1986 to 1996 to evaluate the technique of translaminal epidural endoscopic discectomy in lumbar hernias occupying over 50% of the radicular canal, foraminal hernias, and hernias invading it entirely.	3.3610898767106434
This minimally invasive arthroscopic technique was applied in patients suffering from degenerative lumbar stenosis between L3 and S1.	3.206004004765721
The first part of the study dealt with lumbar hernias.	3.5698590359672218
Of a total of 222 patients, 175 (78.82%) showed radicular canal invasion ranging between 50 and 90%.	3.4982962970825144
The disc level was L4-L5 in 59%, L5-S1 in 39%, and L3-L4 in 4%.	2.9157486905431775
Most of these hernias were lateral extrusions.	2.7841376465652763
However, the study also included protrusions and foraminal hernias, since they were large and technically difficult to operate on.	3.0639035476082777
Surgery was carried out by the biportal posterior approach through the flaval ligament.	3.4051207662370904
An irrigation pump was used and the structures were under permanent accurate arthroscopic visualization.	3.119334362876255
Good results were obtained in 96%, fair in 3%, and poor in 1%.	3.768907097479137
The second part of the study dealt with lateral stenosis.	3.3665337250462044
Drawing from the experience gained by experiments performed in 1993 on five cadavers and by translaminar epidural endoscopy since 1986, this surgical technique was designed to provide decompression by resection of the ventral zone of the articular facet and, in some cases, foramenostomy.	3.5849435995250842
Of the 19 patients treated, nine presented with pathology in one segment, nine in two segments, and one in three segments.	3.43539365268074
All had lumbar and sciatic complaints, intermittent neurological claudication and predominantly lateral sensory motor deficit.	2.7802559550217354
The general results were good in 84% and fair in 16%.	3.179591460958395
The effects of "Care-insurance" on the situation of those in need of home care, is the object of first implementation-studies of SGB XI.	3.321240404348427
An account of the results of the milieu-oriented "Freiburger Pflegestudie", which investigates the effects of "Care-insurance" differentiated according to the various types of care-situations, forms the centre of the article.	3.939178225055896
A possible intraoperative complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is opening of the gallbladder with subsequent loss of gallstones.	3.601329961114084
We report on a 61-year-old woman who was hospitalised with an obscure subhepatic tumor.	2.380570983943492
Intraoperatively an abscess was found that had been caused by lost gallstones following after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 3 years previously.	3.523474386620138
There is a low incidence of late abscesses caused by loss of gallstones, but because of the long latency and unspecific symptoms there may be problems in diagnosis.	3.6974626189343183
Taking into consideration possible complications caused by intraoperative loss of gallstones, all concrements should be retrieved, even though there is no indication for changing to an open procedure.	3.0712297285481083
Since squamous cell carinoma of the penis is rare, prospective trials do not exist.	3.0953244249586525
Therefore, new treatment strategies have to be developed.	4.109113230125128
Based on our experience with the treatment of 22 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma, we describe our therapeutic approaches.	4.37778796872992
Ten patients with superficial disease (T1-2N0M0) were treated with partial penectomy.	3.5028163688662883
The 3-year survival rate amounted to 90 %.	3.2013695827450244
In patients with extensive disease (T3-4 or N1-3) a partial or total penectomy was performed.	3.303056397368853
After initial antibiotic therapy for 4 weeks, patients underwent inguinal lymph-node dissection and if the nodes were positive, additional pelvic lymph-node dissection.	3.824115689563566
In patients with ulcerous inguinal lymph-node metastases surgical resection was performed, covering the wound with a musculocutaneous flap (tensor fascia lata flap n = 2; rectus abdominis flap n = 1).	3.0704136367398047
The 3-year survival rate of patients with T1-2N1 tumours (n = 4) was 67 % and with T3-4N1-3 (n = 8) 25 %.	3.5526944292847773
Patients with distant metastases received inductive systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin, methotrexate and bleomycin.	3.0322818594701717
Objective responses occurred in 22 % (1 CR, 1 PR) of 9 patients.	3.2080014730643605
These results suggest that immediate radical surgery with lymph-node dissection is the best treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.	3.70240303153783
Biomechanical investigations in eight specimen elbow joints to test articulated external fixation showed correct extension-flexion joint position between 0 and 120 °.	2.907012247652258
The central axis through the radial and ulnar condyles varies less than 3 ° in total.	3.1224546542737426
X-ray kinematography showed correct articulation in all cases without subluxation.	3.6682263526379044
In six patients with persistent subluxation and complex fracture of the proximal ulna external fixation with an additional articulation was placed.	4.119815214598927
All patients began with physiotherapy on the 3rd day after operation, the range of joint motion was 0-30-95 ° in all cases, after 6 weeks 0-30-110 °.	3.497548678968208
Additional articulated external fixation at the elbow joint can be an alternative treatment to long-term transfixation of the elbow in cases of complex injury.	4.608912854944078
How important and predicative are clinical parameters and locoregional failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinomas for the probability of the occurrence of distant metastases?	3.805715965540512
From 1 August 1990 to 1 October 1998, 139 patients with carcinomas of the oropharynx were treated in a prospective study by radical radiotherapy and evaluated in regard to the clinical parameters reflex-otalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T-category, presence of involved lymph nodes, and smoking and drinking habits.	3.500211019821922
Twenty-nine patients received a concomitant chemotherapy.	3.5699421810041745
Twenty-five out of 139 patients had a planned neck dissection after completion of radiotherapy.	3.3339369139317663
Ten patients received a salvage operation.	3.7244113481766266
The median follow-up time was 24 months (range, 4 to 74).	3.5084576641781515
Two- and 5-year overall survival rates according to Kaplan Meier were 56.1 and 49.6%.	3.199709823502068
The tumors were controlled in 77/139 patients (55%).	2.9867512064027797
The therapy failed in 62/139 patients (45%).	2.8789746407237606
Both groups, 62 patients with locoregional therapy failure and 77 patients with locoregionally controlled tumors, were comparable in regard to performance status (Karnofsky index), age, gender, TNM-categories, histological differentiation, drinking habits, pretherapeutic diagnostics, total dose (Gy), and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.	3.459527334259466
Locoregional tumor control was significantly determined by the parameters reflex-otalgia (p < 0.0078), predominant growth pattern (p < 0.012), T-category (p < 0.03), and smoking (p < 0.0285).	3.338896373979171
The median survival time of patients with locoregional failure is 17 months.	3.9524362436863267
At this moment 81% of locoregionally controlled patients are still alive.	3.184580908959687
In 14/62 patients (23%) with locoregional failure, distant metastases were detectable against 4/77 (5%) of locally controlled patients, p < 0.0026.	3.301816813509411
Probability of local control and distant metastases, predominantly pulmonary, reached a plateau after 24 months.	3.373271647920068
Locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is an important parameter for the probability of the development of distant metastases.	4.845080688870468
Failure of local therapy is caused by the biologic aggressiveness of the tumor.	3.868819605379894
Telemedicine includes all medical activities in diagnosis, therapeutics, or social medicine undertaken by means of an electronic transfer medium, enabling the transmission of visual and acoustic information over long distances to doctors not personally present at the place of the requested consultation.	3.187687211673915
The aim of this study was to evaluate the retropatellar pressure, force, and contact area in cases of knee arthroplasty compared to knees without arthroplasty.	2.827350096024252
We examined six leg specimens before and after knee arthroplasty.	3.499692921573688
The modified Thiel fixation was used, and arthroplasty was the Genesis I without patellar implant (Fa.	2.9872164572959736
Smith & Nephew, Schenefeld).	3.408372853137993
Contact measurements were performed with pressure-sensitive film (Fuji Prescale type "super low") in 45 °, 60 °, 90 °, and 120 ° knee flexion.	3.107471897924918
The results were evaluated with special software, "Pressure Imaging and Analyzing System FPD-901 Series".	2.7768171620925606
The leg was exarticulated in the hip joint and the knee joint was opened from a suprapatellar approach.	3.5683647420247415
The film was placed at a defined area between the facies patellaris of the femur and facies articularis of the patella.	3.4577596451934998
Instantaneous pressure was measured during a time of 5-s pressure increase and a further 5 s. A force of 280 N was applied to the quadriceps muscle.	3.895963997775061
Before knee arthroplasty, the contact area measured 154.3 mm2, the average pressure was 1.14 MPa, the force 182.13 N. After knee arthroplasty, the contact area was 119.94 mm2, the average pressure 1.522 MPa, the force 180.98 N. Following knee arthroplasty the contact area decreased significantly (P=0.015), and the average (P=0.0001) and maximum pressure (P=0.0003) increased significantly.	2.979062525782304
The force did not change significantly (P=0.7642).	3.2208337817105575
The choice of the knee arthroplasty implant and approach to the knee joint should be considered in order to achieve an increased retropatellar contact area thus preventing smaller contact areas than before knee arthroplasty.	3.9436892872768805
The increased contact area could also prevent increasing retropatellar pressures after knee arthroplasty and further complications.	2.9564553054429807
Maculopathy occurring in young patients is a challenge in differenzial diagnosis.	3.5921833809995594
Besides hereditary macular dystrophies and acquired macular degenerations, rare systemic disorders should be considered.	2.8617266082879094
Histological examination of 1660 biopsies (2 - 5 mm) of the synovial membrane of 317 patients were obtained by arthroscopic dissection; in 70% of all cases non-specific changes were revealed and in 30% specific changes.	3.8108942622977215
The findings included different stages of proliferation of the superficial layer, uncharacteristic inflammatory reactions of the stratum synoviale and fibrosis of the stroma, vascular proliferation and pseudopolypoid thickening of the synovial membrane.	3.220312347762933
The histomorphological findings can only be interpreted reliably and a pathogenetic classification obtained, e.g., detritus synovialitis, rheumatoid arthritis or post-traumatic changes, if the arthroscopic findings conclude an exact documentation of the biopsy site and the clinical findings.	3.621953667230963
The aim of this study was to determine the impact of prolonged single lung ventilation and intrathoracic insufflation of CO2 during computer-enhanced totally endoscopic bypass grafting on biventricular myocardial function.	2.6645958956535956
Methods: Transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively in 20 patients undergoing the above mentioned operation.	3.704627084009632
At distinct time points during the intervention, a cine-loop of both ventricles was registered employing a mid short axis view.	3.0042301240868237
Simultaneously, oxygenation parameters as well as electrocardiographic data and intrathoracic CO2 pressure were taken.	3.9426223753548943
Wall motion analysis was done postoperatively.	3.542596692591455
Results: With increasing duration of single lung ventilation, significant regional and global biventricular hypokinesia was detected.	2.9602872599235637
This was accompanied by a decrease in PaO2 and a marked increase in intrathoracic CO2 pressure.	3.437036883197245
These alterations disappeared after weaning from extracorporeal circulation and reconstitution of double lung ventilation.	3.053684426639453
Conclusion: These results show that computer-enhanced coronary artery bypass grafting leads to significant alterations in intraoperative biventricular myocardial function.	3.2842091521353804
This can be due to either an impact on oxygenation during single lung ventilation or due to intrathoracic CO2 insufflation.	3.1447234076006114
However, in our group, these alteration showed only small clinical relevance.	3.0441863057259546
During the last few years the fast development of different laser and laser-like systems for photoepilation and their one-sided representation in media has led to confusion among pysicians and patients.	2.768488388625818
The object of this review is to give a structured report of different pulsed laser and laser-like systems (Epilight, Photoderm, long-pulsed ruby-, alexandrite- and diodelaser) that are available in Germany, including their side effects and complications.The current status of scientific investigation in this field is discussed.	3.2737261659078922
The purpose of the present study was to increase the free range of motion in conventional trust-plate prosthesis design and to optimize the trust-plate contact as well as the osteointegration area below the trust-plate.	3.308540942179202
Although familial occurrence of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) has been commonly observed, data on a genetic role in this condition are limited.	3.319359602194519
A few studies have reported familial aggregation and association with HLA.	3.1229576712255374
Malformations of the urinary tract are one of the most common types of anomalies in the neonatal period.	3.6511865426485985
Approximately 15-20% of all prenatally detected malformations  require acute postnatal imaging.	3.342504522060117
Sonography is the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of nephro-urologic problems in infancy.	3.50815857653758
Hydronephrosis represents the most common pathology, followed by multicystic-dysplastic kidney.	4.237416277608086
Discussion: The result of the sonographic examination directs further imaging.	3.6262414885648777
An adequate diagnostic algorithm is decisive  for accurate diagnosis, for the appropriate therapeutic regimen and for the prognosis  of the patients.	3.833817905902494
Previous studies have shown that calcification is decreased in porcine heart valves that have undergone treatment for lipid extraction.	3.105464117413713
The relation between lipid distribution and calcification of seven new commercially available porcine bioprosthetic heart valves (St. Jude Medical, Bioimplant) is assessed by Sudan red III staining to show preexisting lipids.	2.561605841769651
All porcine bioprosthetic valves contained lipids to different degrees.	3.169018512420013
Five valves were subjected to the pulsatile accelerated calcification process for 4 weeks.	3.042248408348668
Distribution and level of calcification were evaluated by radiography and compared to the Sudan red-stained fatty areas.	3.766476304798263
Comparison of the calcifications detected by radiography and the macroscopically detected lipids showed a coincidence of 57-66%.	3.0472968534001628
Two porcine bioprosthetic valves were histologically prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and von Kossa's stain, respectively.	2.7446201737788307
By light microscopy, the von Kossa staining revealed microcalcifications and polarizing microscopic investigation showed birefractive substances in areas with lipid deposits.	2.8482437229305173
These preexisting substances in porcine valve tissue may play a determinative role in the calcification of the tissue.	3.611951144916446
Substantial studies are necessary to further determine the role of preexisting lipids in calcification.	3.9211592439919354
Therapy for hip dysplasia and DDH by means of sonography.	4.123974984771781
Numerous methods are available for treating "congenital" dysplasia of the hip (CDH).	3.9619674314827487
A historical review of the diagnosis of so-called "congenital dysplasia" and dislocation of the hip and different indications for therapeutic maneuvers is given.	4.420636075222578
Generally, a three-step plan of treatment is recommended: dislocated heads must be reduced, after which retention is needed until the hip joint is stable.	3.529406669167223
This is followed by maturation period, until the nonossified hyalin cartilagineous performed acetabular roof is ossified.	2.6857400776442146
All hip joints, regardless of age, can be assigned to one of these phases.	4.187139406810864
In all cases, measures are taken to prevent ischemic necrosis of the femoral head.	3.124565752958464
To prevent the residual dysplasia of the acetabulum roof and femoral head necrosis, the reduction-retention position should be more than 90  ° flexion in the hip joint, but not more than 45-50  ° abduction.	3.956069105352159
In each therapeutic phase there is a different biomechanical situation in the hip joint.	3.596949339912943
The appropriate orthosis for treatment is chosen according to the particular biomechanical situation.	3.559510432588731
Each sonographic type can be set up according to the our classification in the three-phase treatment system.	4.0558841297257056
In this way the adequate orthosis for treatment in each treatment-phase can be chosen.	3.228315323454273
A case of a patient with malignant acanthosis nigricans in association with carcinoma of the lung is reported, documenting successful palliative treatment of the warty papillomatous thickening of the lips with electrocautery.	3.6488004896715958
Molecular atmospheric oxygen contains two unpaired electrons in the unreactive triplet state and thus has to be activated in order to react with other biological molecules in the singlet ground state.	3.293447444373465
These processes of activation include very reactive intermediates.	3.0672544593110365
Therefore, aerobic cells must cope with - and to some extent also adapt to - oxidative stress provoked for example by infection or intoxication, where reactive intermediates of oxygen activation accumulate.	2.886412970845676
Depending on the strength of these impacts, several symptoms indicate the deviation from normal, steady-state metabolism.	2.8450842856985528
Most of these visible or measurable symptoms are connected with oxygen activation where principally a transition from heterolytic reactions (two-electron transitions) to increased homolytic reactions (one-electron transitions) is observed.	2.6422583139193145
Homolytic reactions produce free radicals, which are generally counteracted by a parallel increase of intrinsic radical scavenging processes or by compounds administered with food, thus warranting metabolic control within certain limits.	3.134997812986008
At advanced states of stress, control may be gradually lost and chaotic radical processes dominate.	2.915699740683266
Finally, cellular decompartmentalizations yield apoptotic, lytic and/or necrotic processes.	3.347364153395644
Every episode during this cascade is characterizable by the balance between pro- and antioxidative capacities.	2.967912340281983
Antioxidants, which in many cases are free radical scavengers or quenchers of activated states, comprise a wealth of classes of organic molecules including phenolics, probably as the most prominent ones.	3.379815821331604
In this article, mechanisms of oxygen activation and protection from oxidative damage are discussed.	2.8648194394649504
Furthermore, examples of antioxidative functions of a few important natural products are reported.	3.067821047234877
In a monocenter prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial the efficacy of homeopathic treatment was investigated on children with adenoid vegetations justifying an operation.	3.204076058068692
Patients were treated with either homeopathic remedies such as Nux vomica D200, Okoubaka D3, Tuberculinum D200, Barium jodatum D4 and Barium jodatum D6 or with placebo.	2.477413380725489
The duration of the study for each patient was 3 months.	4.659130103418737
Examination of the ears using a microscope, rhinoscopy, stomatoscopy and pharyngoscopy, as well as tympanometry and audiometry were performed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.	3.3680893379534163
Out of a total of 97 children studied between the ages of 4 to 10 years 82 could be analyzed.	3.5872179497366976
At the end of the study no operation was required in 70.7% of the placebo-treated children and in 78.1% of the children treated with homeopathic preparations.	3.3722339875218132
These results show no statistical significance.	3.1932392083336008
A treatment technique favorable for linacs with asymmetric jaws, which combined cranio-caudal matching fields with fields enclosing the whole target volume, is investigated with respect to field matching and sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	2.595973460963456
For a pelvic target volume rapidly varying in cranio-caudal direction a 5-field technique was planned with individually weighted and blocked fields.	2.8938206092554144
Three fields adjoining in cranio-caudal direction were completed by 2 fields enclosing the whole target volume.	2.6195332125450395
The matching line was measured and calculated with Helax TMS©.	3.306702385368697
Furthermore a 4-field box and opposing fields were planned.	3.1354203671233223
The dose-volume histograms for target, bladder, intestine and soft tissue were exported.	3.159646960361255
Normal tissue complication probability and tumor control probability, respectively, were calculated for all techniques.	3.4599584644889823
In the region of the matching line the summation of the measured normalized curves resulted in relative dose maxima of 6.0% (caudal) and 4.5% (cranial), respectively.	2.334723167677297
For fields enclosing the whole target volume the dose maxima in the region of the matching line decreased to 2.0% (caudal) and 1.8% (cranial), respectively.	2.5120624536696448
For the dose profiles calculated with Helax TMS© no overdose was found.	2.7757682744719103
The 5-field technique with adjoining fields results in a better sparing of the organs at risk compared to the other techniques, whereas the tumor control remains the same.	3.7373620138671115
In specific cases a technique with cranio-caudal adjoining fields can be recommended with respect to sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	2.9826084380619986
Disseminated Langerhans-cell-histiocytosis (LCH) is most frequent in children at the age of 1-3 years, seldomly seen in adults and extremely rare in the elderly.	4.260877885374923
The clinical course may be acute, subacute or chronic, progressive or stationary.	3.0913281699076958
Spontaneous remissions are possible, but rare.	3.7139797191273813
In elderly patients often the disease is at first limited to the skin before it becomes systemic.	3.9805204159402563
Because of its central location, the elbow joint is considered the most important joint within the upper extremity from the viewpoint of function.	3.752899845133968
Conditions following elbow trauma are often accompanied by chronic pain and diminished range of motion, leading to functional deficits of the entire arm.	4.036653312687627
There is now practically no doubt that primary osteosynthesis, anatomical joint reconstruction and early onset of functional treatment are essential for a good final outcome.	3.2040766132884446
With our expanding knowledge of the anatomical and biomechanical condtions in the proximal lower arm in the last few decades the basic principles of therapy have also changed, and current standards of treatment for proximal forearm trauma are presented in this paper with reference to the relevant literature.	3.8287878701250597
The series of five patients with symptomatic isolated right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and no structural heart disease which were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the ectopic focus are reported in order to discuss radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment in patients with right ventricular outflow tract ectopy without ventricular tachycardia.	4.022125510916357
Basic principles for treating patients with chronic pain are presented.	4.132712779858437
They are the result of a longterm collaboration of collegues from different medical specialties in the pain outpatient unit of the University of Ulm.	3.3286161877828775
In contrast to a variety of literature on chronic pain patients, these principles focus on the contribution of the therapists to the development of problems in treatment.	4.028216716365885
Eight principles, considered especially important for the treatment of chronic pain patients are presented and discussed.	4.206775751224835
We discuss this entity with the aid of a case report and the existing literature.	3.7323279401438003
The therapy of these tumors includes resection and possible adjuvant radiotherapy.	3.2233225915552617
14 human femurs were scanned by CAT and 3D reconstructed.	3.1274954660553256
With a special software package (Orthodoc) virtual preoperative planning for implantation of a cementless total hip alloplasty was undertaken.	3.086596403319457
The specimens were randomised into two groups, one of which had manual and the other one robot implantation of the femoral component.	4.065832289744219
After implantation all specimens were evaluated again by CAT and CCT and AT angle were documented again.	2.8730890658856785
The preoperative CCD angle was 126.7  ° (SD = 4.0) in the manual group and 127.8  ° (SD = 4.3) in the robodoc group.	2.9455807124867994
Postoperatively the angle averaged 131.9  ° (SD = 0.8) in the manual group and 133.2  ° (SD = 1.9) in the robodoc group.	3.0622041792275887
Significant differences were found for the AT angle in both groups.	3.270558968516011
The preoperative AT angle in the manual group was 31.3  ° (SD = 8.8), decreasing to 20.5  ° (SD = 9.5) after implantation.	2.8977528147394316
In the robodoc group this angle was 30.9  ° (SD = 8.0) before and 31.3  ° (SD = 8.7) after implantation.	2.8747529579732323
The difference between pre- and postoperative AT angle averaged 10.8  ° (SD = 6.4) in the manual group and only 0.4  ° (SD = 0.9) in the robodoc-group.	3.333383609101488
Conclusion: With the technique used, preoperative planning in hip alloarthroplasty is much more accurate than with the conventional technique with plain X-ray.	3.427651012160963
The virtual preoperative planning can be transferred to the intraoperative setting with high precision.	3.473133949523575
These factors may lead to an increase in outcome quality.	4.048424068032397
1000 drug-related fatalities that were examined in Hamburg from 1990-1996 by the Institute of Legal Medicine were analysed with respect to consumption of substitute drugs such as methadone.	3.5065450761532193
The incidence of methadone-related fatalities has increased in the last two years.	3.9187028714501646
The highest incidence was found in 1995 when methadone was detected in the blood of about 20% of all drug-related fatalities.	3.9816789880225696
Lethal monointoxications or combined intoxications with a dominant role of methadone were experienced rarely (about 1% of all drug-related fatalities).	3.175561354771857
Of the persons who were enroled since 1990 in a methadone maintenance programme 2% have been registered as drug- related fatalities.	2.8819050249798144
The mortality of street addicts without comparable medical help was about 10% in the same period.	2.9279085444403203
There is further need for improved methods of registration, documentation and forensic/sociological analysis of all drug-related fatalities for reliable conclusions concerning mortality rates of drug users who are enroled in methadone maintenance programmes.	2.9248320662171623
Pulmonary infections and tumors are a major cause of death in patients with AIDS.	4.235684388919272
The combination of clinical, radiological, laboratory, and pathohistological data helps to narrow the spectrum of differential diagnoses or even allows a specific diagnosis in many patients.	3.4225897818274347
Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis should be obtained as soon as possible during the clinical course of the illness to initiate treatment in time.	3.6763036071019854
Computed tomography (CT) has proven to provide promising results in the diagnosis of AIDS-related thoracic diseases.	3.6493036413705107
The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the diagnostic capacities of CT in the context of particular AIDS-related thoracic pathologies.	3.220978153489492
Additional information on the spectrum of pathological agents and on differential diagnostic signs is summarized.	3.6030185618541077
This study was designed to provide information to which extend home-based nursing care services for the elderly take part in the care for older people with mental disorders.	3.209452141100598
Also of interest was the involvement of clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system in the health care for the clients.	3.3181554592847067
68% of the mental disordered clients had dementia or a demential disorder, 6% a functional psychoses, and 31% a neurotic, psychogenic disorder or substance abuse (small number of clients with two and more diagnoses).	3.1720008781563878
82% of clients with mental disorders had one or more additional somatic disease(s).	3.367762156514589
These diseases were mostly the cause for the involvement of home-based nursing care service.	3.4181069446382306
Barely 8% of clients with mental disorders were placed from clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system into the nursing care services.	2.6491424219146675
Beside the home-based care, only 12% of mental disordered received clients outpatient psychiatric treatment.	3.233893321103408
Systematic cooperation between the nursing care services and the system of (gero-) psychiatric treatemnt was a rare exception.	3.5156702623747487
Acute cerebral nerve paresis can be caused in many different ways.	3.5871444735779066
One of the more rare causes of paresis of one or more neural pathways is dissection of the internal carotid artery.	3.0227843660256903
Early diagnosis is important, even with atypical symptoms, since prompt anticoagulative therapy can hinder stroke from embolism due to the dissection.	3.7025958087751727
We report on two patients with Raeder's syndrome and Collet-Sicard syndrome resulting from dissection of the internal carotid artery.	2.459150382013153
Besides the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our study, loss of function has also been reported with the sixth to eighth cranial nerves, so that any painful, sudden cranial nerve deficiency can indicate possible carotid dissection.	3.4930713205225996
In hematopoiesis, regulation and differentiation present a very complex functional network in which multiple factors of the microenvironment are involved.	3.145185975924794
In addition to direct cell-to-cell contacts and the modifying influences of the intercellular matrix, soluble mediators play an important role in intercellular communication.	3.1859939501303276
Cytokines exert their effects by binding with specific receptors that transfer their signals to individual cells.	3.156035095528861
A common structure shared by subunits of these receptors leads to competitive inhibition in binding the cytokines with different affinity.	2.8150517067597884
A flood of in vitro and in vivo studies have established the impact of various cytokines on single hematopoietic cell lineages and their application for clinical use.	3.1791223053476387
However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the cellular origin of the cytokines.	3.3242197384148415
Wound healing represents a dynamic process of increasing scientific interest, especially with the detection of the different growth factors.	4.216573187620622
Economic aspects are also of importance in the investigation of substances used for wound healing.	3.8259674442927105
In Germany 25% of all patients (ca.	3.6076270489367164
1 million) with severe chronic venous insufficiency have crural ulcers.	3.4818202526320534
The influence of bacterial infection of crural ulcers is controversial.	3.0461586964045306
There is no doubt that the quantity of bacteria is of importance.	3.0112532528317555
Local antibiotic treatment is difficult, as most of the substances used are known to inhibit wound healing.	4.444434664751353
In vivo and in vitro investigations showed, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic has a bacteriostatic function.	3.0791471395686147
Additionally it was shown, using cultures of fibroblasts, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic does not inhibit the growth of fibroblasts, whereas PVP-iodine solution, a widely used antiseptic, clearly reduces the growth of fibroblasts.	3.0827573336615166
This article presents the heuristics concerning description of individual generative behavior.	2.613263206698442
The aim is to describe the development of the desire for children, the generative action and the dealing with generative decisions for intended and unintended childless women and men as well as parents.	3.621782632587332
The main emphasis of the existing heuristics is placed on psychological questions.	3.09547722840734
It may be helpful to use heuristics which describe development of and coping with generative action as background information to ensure comprehensive consultation and therapy planning.	2.9854257520039145
Morbus Parkinson is a progressive degenerative disease of the human central, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems.	3.687049184180117
In the course of the disease, not only the substantia nigra, but also extranigral components of the motor system, as well as numerous limbic system and autonomic centers undergo serious damage.	3.6464998808792437
Accordingly, Parkinson's disease is a multisystem disorder.	3.15815536858384
Only specific types of projection neurons fall victim to it.	3.036566037141671
Intracytoplasmic inclusions evolving in the form of Lewy bodies in perikarya and Lewy neurites in the neuronal processes result in premature cell death of the affected neurons.	3.126008653634799
On the basis of this selective neuronal vulnerability, a categorization emerges of the pathological changes within the nervous system and corresponding functional impairments.	2.8542380113502217
Introduction: Children with "nursing bottle syndrome" and long standing teeth destructions and no treatment so far were examined for accompanying pathological changes in the bacterial flora of the mouth and alterations due to chronic inflammation of the oral mucosa and the alveolar jawbone.	3.3616058092915755
Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone marrow caused by both non-specific and specific agents.	4.472961871785557
Non-specific endogenic osteomyelitis represents the most frequent form, followed by the specific form caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.	3.6078336425593727
Typically, the non-specific form occurs in children and young adults, and the sites most frequently affected are the distal and the proximal ends of the tibia and femur.	4.971250224112159
In tuberculosis, osteomyelitis is predominantly located in the vertebral bodies.	3.568296043910326
In rare cases osteomyelitis can be caused by viruses, fungi or echinococcus.	3.0899125243628576
It may also occur as so-called acute endogenic osteomyelitis, such as plasmocellular osteomyelitis and Brodie's abscess.	3.793693469430058
Histologically, dense infiltration of leucocytes, granulation tissue and bone sequesters can be seen.	3.137895494647254
In tuberculosis granulomas with central necrosis, epithelioid cells and giant cells of Langhans type are characteristically found.	2.790244431723826
Most forms of acute osteomyelitis can be successfully treated with antibiotics, leading to complete healing without complications.	4.154665380060477
Only a few reported cases develop into a secondary, chronic form.	3.0189031408957776
Precision of osteodensitometric measurements using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) depends on various known factors, such as positioning, aortic calcification or vertebral fractures.	3.1654288134969413
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of various diseases or bone density on the reproducibility of measurements in the lumbar spine and the proximal femur.	3.3793256620016088
Measurements in the LWS p.a., LWS lat.	2.6487801135695586
and at Ward's triangle were made in a total of 100 patients.	4.023414171765904
The subjects were repositioned between measurements.	3.2226354990821213
In order to be able to determine the influence of various diseases, four groups of 25 patients each were formed: three with the diagnosis osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and one control group.	3.660017287724531
The mean percentual difference and coefficient of variation were calculated as the measure for reproducibility.	3.0515602512127455
Mean percentual differences of 0.18 to 2.6% were found in the four groups at the three measurements sites.	3.59731868279588
After calculation of coefficient of variation, a value between 1.2 and 2.7% was found for LWS p.a., between 7.1 and 15.7% for LWS lat.	2.941998513384602
and between 4.1 and 9.9% at Ward's triangle.	3.3248191853869917
It was also conspicuous that the difference in coefficient of variation in osteoporosis patients was nearly double that in the control group in all measured areas.	3.499818749091547
Conclusion: Lateral lumbar spinal measurements using DEXA cannot presently be recommended.	2.9554196309339993
measurements and, with limitations, measurements at Ward's triangle have good precision and could be used for course documentation of bone density.	3.8544000120246187
Diseases of the peripheral nervous system occur in up to 50% of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).	3.03815326173778
In early stages of the infection, Guillain-Barré syndrome or a spontaneously remitting mononeuropathy can occur.	2.790141139723585
The most frequent occurrence is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy associated with HIV, which can only be treated symptomatically.	3.1919443047750904
The most important differential diagnosis is a drug-induced polyneuropathy under antiretroviral therapy with the nucleoside analogues DDI, DDC, or D4T.	2.970377897903269
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is less common and can be treated with immunoglobulins or corticosteroids.	3.628136898091192
Very rare are steroid-responsive neuropathies with necrotizing vasculitis or in diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS).	2.7769591215607354
In the AIDS stage, polyradiculitis can occur due to opportunistic infections - most often with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or M. tuberculosis - or polyradiculopathies due to lymphomatous meningiosis.	2.7388584837642798
Mononeuritis multiplex is rarely seen in disseminated CMV infection.	3.4750837081876713
Myopathies can occur in all stages of HIV infection; their frequency is about 1%.	4.0110032144281185
Primary polymyositis associated with HIV, which can be treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulin, must be distinguished from myopathy induced by azidothymidine.	3.3224346136927467
Other forms of myopathy are very rare.	3.608069518497892
54 patients, who had been explored at the end of their treatment including a psychosomatic approach in a medical department of a general hospital, were interviewed again in their homes three months later.	4.300242912532931
Contentment with treatment was high in the inpatient and outpatient setting, the ill felt only moderately stressed by their illnesses, showed an adaptive constellation of coping styles and were surprisingly well adapted.	2.936698759504627
The comparison between the two measures showed a less favourable view of the patients three months after discharge from hospital at a quarter of the tested parameters, the variability was high in the scales, that were used.	4.1425930150227135
Explanations for these results are discussed.	4.25117349209049
At a long term perspective coping with illness may be improved especially by interventions of the family doctors.	3.5054059378721605
Health care costs have risen considerably since 1970 in all industrialized countries.	2.8017711119570263
This has several causes: changes in demographic structure, the large number of physicians, increased personnel needs resulting from generous vacation and special leave privileges, wage increases and - last but not least - medical progress.	2.933128386634763
Advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for spiralling costs in health care.	3.432243920459885
Careful analyses reveal, however, that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high-technology (CT, MR) imaging.	4.197167686089376
The legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained.	3.2728385103586026
Relevant suggestions, such as generally accepted examination strategies, should be realized with the help of the scientific societies.	4.039955654647806
Background: Main features of the Coffin-Siris syndrome are mental retardation and absent or hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers and toes.	2.9274696992540203
Further symptoms are wide mouth with prominent lips, sparse scalp hair, and hypertrichosis.	2.949994162631808
We report on two premature infants who had completed 25 and 29 weeks of gestation and who developed unilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema.	2.969243585145492
In both cases massive mediastinal displacement developed with compression and total atelectasis of the contralateral lung.	2.9063409169781638
By selective intubation of the respective main bronchus, complete ventilation of the collapsed lungs and sufficient gas exchange was achieved.	3.2632438742160734
After 3 days (case 1) and after 6 days) case 2), the unilateral emphysema receded and, subsequently, bilateral respiration was possible without relapse.	3.93523129743271
The two children were discharged at the age of 41/2 and 21/2 months showing complete respiratory compensation and equal ventilation on both sides.	3.295550543196911
Patient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris maculosa seu papulosa (Davies-Colley) presented with multiple cutaneous horns.	2.912540758087165
The clinical picture, the histology, the electro microscopic examination, the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses.	3.3201660849451913
The patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures.	3.0691849849597665
Nitrous oxide (N2O) oxidises vitamin B12 and thus decreases DNA production by inactivation of methionine synthase.	2.807751200729064
Therefore, the United States and most European health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks.	2.75425942013654
These values range from 25 to 100 ppm, expressed as time-weighted averages (TWA).	2.985859557424164
There is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions.	2.817221148658118
The aim of this study was to quantify levels of N2O in a recovery room (RR) with an air conditioning system.	2.7651942963329126
The blood loss during the acute period after complex pelvic trauma is finally responsible for the high mortality associated with this specific type of injury.	3.789732999969013
Several protocols have been published for optimized management, but up to now comparable data are not available as no exact definitions exist judging the severty of trauma and blood loss.	3.6073255897123446
As part of a prospective study 19 patients after unstable pelvic injuries with unstable circulation underwent emergency stabilization by the pelvic C-clamp.	3.7119856922529353
Beside standard clinical parameter the initial hemoglobin value was converted into a "bloodvolume equivalent".	3.1297250339997946
18 of the 19 patients had an injury severety according to group III and IV of the Hannover Polytrauma Score (PTS).	3.5251077977152363
Concommitant abdominal injuries were seen in 12 cases (23 injuries), concommitant urological injuries in 12 cases (14 injuries).	3.693910208129007
In 13 cases the pelvis was the major source of bleeding in 9 cases an additional intraabdominal hemorrhage was observed.	3.3977253648119126
11 patients died due to sequelae of their injury, 8 patients survived.	3.576151906520722
Although the initial blood loss was comparable both in the group of the deceased patients and the survivors, a 44% higher subsequent blood substitution (= 10 089 ml) was observed in the nonsurvivor group.	3.9923820264618417
In conclusion the data proofed that early control of hemorrhage is fundamental for the prognoses after complex pelvic trauma.	2.767521601845785
The estimation of the blood loss may help in indicating agressive emergency procedures like emergency stabilisation, pelvic clamps, surgical exploration and tamponade.	3.43049254289826
This calculation may be a basis for a more detailed analyses of this devastating injury and judging the benefit of different management protocols.	3.742640590259259
In contrast to childhood intussusception, the clinical signs of intussusception in adults are nonspecific.	3.343728554385232
Generally organic alterations of the small bowel cause intussusception in adults.	3.735187413220532
In this case report on a retrograde jejunojejunal intussusception in a 61-year-old male, following removal of an intraoperatively placed intestinal tube for ileus therapy, the clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods and therapy for intussusception are described.	3.457501230156032
Sonography is not only the diagnostic tool of choice in childs, but also led to the correct diagnosis in this case.	5.257931789571373
In contrast to childhood intussusception, operative treatment is preferred in adults.	2.717577577221623
The term "frontal lobe syndrome" comprises a variety of different clinical syndromes produced by focal lesions involving the prefrontal cortex.	3.0392899163954263
However, similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks.	3.249288348790771
With respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions, prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a disorganized type, caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections, a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex, and an apathetic type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the cingulum and the supplementary motor area.	3.323913558451991
As intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described, in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed.	3.6904574257154494
The case reports of four patients illustrating the three major prefrontal syndroms following severe head injury (n=2) or cerebrovascular disease (n=2) are presented and diagnostic implications as well as possible treatment strategies are discussed.	4.068316004016
The measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients, their family, and personnel.	3.663398336558515
A lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine, which in turn makes an impression on public opinion, and disturbs the reputation of the co-workers in intensive care medicine.	3.413189059179103
To form an objective view, we carried out a survey of 40 co-workers (11 physicians, 23 from the nursing staff, and 6 ancillary personnel) regarding the medical technology, the environment in the unit, general medical questions, and the extent of intensive care therapy.	3.6641091059709767
The length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1-240 months (median 18 months), the ages ranged from 21 to 53 years (median 30 years).	3.538082108210528
Of those questioned 73%  found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful: 100% of the physicians and only 57% of the nursing staff were of this opinion.	3.452907351499945
Only 9% of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear-inducing for the patients; in contrast, 61% of the nursing staff believed this to be true.	3.802364421895418
The noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65% of the nursing staff and 45% of the physicians.	3.6852872525771305
Only 22% of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit; 48% felt that they were unhappy or even miserable.	3.2296352387710088
Of the physicians 46% believed that the patients were comfortable.	3.6997700552022033
Of the nursing staff 100% were of the opinion that for the deceased patients, organ substitution therapy had continued too long.	3.374245043330141
On the other hand, only 45% of the residents shared this opinion.	2.580634655850004
The medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful, less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff.	3.950175643157296
In many cases, the nursing staff as a group exhibited a contrary and negative opinion.	3.335324368293035
This could possibly be caused by insecurity, lack of information and lack of successful experiences.	3.6731331109787746
Next to patient outcome, the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team, with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine.	3.903706832888876
In this pilot study 12 patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were treated with 2 million IU interferon alpha 2a (Roferon A) three times weekly for 8 weeks and followed up for a further 10 weeks: 2 patients showed clear and 9 a slight to moderate reduction of their skin lesions; 1 patient got worse.	3.4513142127284095
Pruritus did not decrease and even increased in a few patients, and IgE levels showed no change during and after treatment.	4.1547987440455465
All patients noted mild, transient, flu-like symptoms.	2.930584052392828
The efficacy of interferon alpha in the present therapeutic design for the treatment of atopic eczema must thus be classified as only moderate.	3.6903930829719074
Shock secondary to sepsis is a serious common disease with a substantial mortality.	3.762994817132539
Coagulation abnormalities, ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, are well recognized in patients with bacterial septicemia.	3.2790746965901625
Therefore, the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps.	3.8977143889688457
We investigated 30 intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of abnomalities in coagulation at the beginning.	3.2101175426075272
Fifteen patients were treated with 1.5-5 E/kg body weight (Low dose group), the others received 8-15 E/kg (high dose group).	4.236766068324272
Our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters - such as d-dimer, TAT and PTF 1 + 2 - in the High dose group without any bleeding disorder.	2.951881240667979
Thus, we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with LMWH as shown above.	3.300783268994297
Background: Laparoscopic techniques are currently used for curative resection of colorectal cancer although long-term results from controlled clinical trials are not available yet that prove laparoscopic procedures are adequate.	3.941816047535665
Methods: All patients who underwent a curative resection of a colorectal tumor from 1995 to 1997 were included in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the short- and long-term results.	3.9861229110715164
Results: Laparoscopic colorectal resections were accomplished in 68 patients.	3.2567768099345074
In only 3 patients was an adenoma (stage 0) found, and 10 patients had multiple liver metastases at the time of palliative resection.	3.689620018503356
An oncological resection was performed in 55 patients.	4.200892137481725
The average age was 62.8  +/-  14.6 years (29 female and 26 male patients).	2.8361215766169834
Eleven right colectomies, 1 left colectomy, 21 sigmoid resections, 16 proctosigmoidectomies and 6 abdominoperineal resections were carried out.	2.831467635799176
Two patients (3.6 %) were lost during follow-up.	2.908744131846698
The median follow-up was 27.1 months (range 9.1-45.1 months).	3.1681472150062184
No port-site metastases were found.	3.104856455268875
Two patients who are still alive after sigmoid resection suffered from a recurrence.	3.8712707060762095
The first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma.	2.8762748927430453
The second patient developed bilateral lung metastases.	2.9443753662282357
Only one patient died during the follow-up period because of myocardial infarction.	3.802059210608421
Conclusion: Although the follow-up is short, it seems that the recurrence rate is low.	3.9678351704452157
Controlled multicenter clinical trials are currently performed to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is really adequate to treat colorectal cancer.	3.7236773709914552
The authors report a tracheal rupture in a 34-year-old patient who was primarily intubated following generalised seizures and loss of consciousness (Rüsch endotracheal tube).	2.954528400274327
Some hours later, she developed high ventilatory airway pressures and subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were noted.	3.11007301109505
Reintubation with a high-volume, low-pressure endotracheal tube was planned when it was noted that the ballon of the Rüsch tube was grossly overinflated.	3.6379976976571036
Endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured and found to be greater than 120 cm H2O (the maximum measurement possible with the manometer).	3.680078995439528
The diagnosis of tracheal rupture was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.	3.2950473169329193
The patient immediately underwent a throacotomy and a 3-cm tear of the pars membranacea of the trachea was sutured with a dural patch.	3.3053188212787856
To maintain low airway pressures post-operatively, she remained sedated for 2 days and received a muscle relaxant to permit pressure-controlled ventilation.	3.3562878279884365
In this case, it can be concluded that excessive inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff resulted in the tracheal rupture.	3.526313803651917
Other possible causes and results of tracheal rupture are discussed.	3.5904576966585386
Urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40% of all nosocomial infections.	4.317684894198769
In most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters.	3.2064862650335986
The guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, as the most important evidence-based guideline worldwide, was published in 1981 and has not been updated so far.	3.3611686239741623
Evidence-based national guidelines are not available in Germany.	3.7169762928417613
We have, therefore, performed a literature search for randomized, controlled studies on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (Medline, Cochrane Library, reference text books) published since 1981.	3.077316178360163
Fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified.	3.282592329929937
Substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials.	3.6088958476960276
Chronic hypoperfusion of the hypogastric arteries due to aortoiliac surgery leads to a complex of symptoms well known as Lerich's syndome.	3.2773028063424245
In contrast, acute ischemia of the pelvic arterial tree leads to lethal complications [2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13].	3.901885959790967
Acute interruption of the hypogastric perfusion mainly occurs after aortoiliac surgery or after selective transcatheter embolisation of the internal iliac artery for control of pelvic bleeding [1, 8].	3.42468717068688
Several complications may occur after total occlusion: urinary bladder necrosis [6], left colon ischemia, spinal cord ischemia [10], nerve palsy, necrosis of the rectum and gluteal musculature [2, 11-13].	3.3208345049347696
Despite adequate therapy, mortality is over 70% [2].	3.4728932661619747
We report the case of a 66-year-old patient who survived after acute occlusion of the iliac arteries with gluteal necrosis following replacement of the infrarenal aorta with an aortobiiliacal graft.	3.053205592518818
As demonstrated in 44 allogeneic sibling (34 HLA identical, 10 HLA mismatched at 1-3 loci) and 6 unrelated (1 HLA-identical, 5 mismatched at 1-3 loci) cord blood (CB) transplantations CB has been shown to be a rich source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.	2.720321138280561
Therefore, a scientific pilot project in order to evaluate HLA class I and II typed cord blood samples for unrelated transplantation was initiated.	3.328352187388209
Hitherto 372 CB samples: mean volume 79 +/-  5x108, were collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after vaginal full term delivery (n=302) or ceasarean section (n=70) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen.	2.762710722157279
Methods for HLA-typing by serology for HLA-class I and II from minimal cell amounts were adjusted that only 1.5 ml of the whole CB was needed for both the HLA-class I and II typing by serology (1 ml) and DNA-typing for HLA-class II (0.5 ml).	3.1347732447233856
Only 3.5 additional ml of the CB were required for the AB0 typing, control of sterility, determination of progenitor cells by colony forming assays and CD34 and the analysis of contaminating maternal cells by simultaneous immunophenotypic and genotypic analysis of interphase cells and the PCR using sequence-specific priming (PCR-SSP) for the non-inherited maternal allel.	3.0585784625641232
Mother'sera have been tested for HBsAg, anti-HCV, -HAV, -HIV-1-2, -EBV, -VCA, -HTLVI-II, -CMV, Toxoplasmosis and Syphilis.	3.678687533252554
Nonepithelial malignant tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms with a frequency of ~0,6%.	3.905005859009766
They are always explored because of a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.	3.679720688551321
Amongst the more than 600 primary pancreatic neoplasms in our pancreatic tumor archive only 5 neoplasms were of nonepithelial origin (one was a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [MPNST], one a leiomyosarcoma, one a malignant mesothelioma, and two were peripheral neuroectodermal tumors [PNET].	3.065292354989627
The differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum, undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and, especially in the case of PNET, malignant lymphoma.	3.872197865512235
Preoperative chemotherapy and down-staging can improve the operability and  prognosis, especially in PNET.	3.888871242470227
In patients with renal or hepatic failure, the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways, leading to the necessity to correct the dose.	3.4853187888562505
The liver is the major site for biotransformation of most opioids.	3.306202564946253
The major metabolic pathway is oxidation.	3.0790988344261105
Exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine, which undergo primarily glucuronidation, and remifentanil which is cleared by esther hydrolysis.	2.9647504769620205
The hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly excreted by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency.	4.039481138331519
Some metabolites such as morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) or normeperidine are active opioid agonists.	2.940049034447115
With high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression.	3.242411691434135
In addition, special risks are known for normepridine that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures.	3.8159622627978926
Few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramdol have been reported.	3.3635879689830186
The elimination half-life of these drugs was prolonged.	3.697641204562916
Lastly, the disposition of methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure.	3.1901364289855967
Backgrounds: Aim of this study was to validate a modification of adults' 13C-urea breath test for children in diagnosis of an infection with Helicobacter pylori.	3.0928374507142156
Methods: In 30 asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an ELISA test specific for Helicobacter pylori.	3.921378926057346
In 10 symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa.	3.455281845150572
Cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal.	3.376982779928935
Results: With the serological or histological result as reference method, the cut-off value for children (delta value = 5 permil) has shown a sensitivity/specificity of 70 %/95 % or 100 %/100 % respectively.	3.0218777336853764
Cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly.	3.350345947382204
30 minutes after 13C-urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection.	3.480478188322896
Conclusion: Our modification of the 13C-urea breath test for children is suitable to prove an Helicobacter pylori infection.	2.7123692000572013
This review summarizes some aspects of German pediatrics as it developed after world war II.	2.9709299176810076
Having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late forties and fifties and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly industialoized nation.	2.80014778544214
As in other countries, the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social attidudes and expectations, and by economic restrictions.	3.274440740076745
National specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and formalized preventive care program under a public health plan.	3.142492797136285
The need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among subspecialties.	3.379078766359946
Aim of this study was to isolate T lymphocytes from atheromatous plaques and to determine they respond to Chlamydia antigens.	2.9848282091692546
In recent years, mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease.	3.21164799682261
However, since October 1994 a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed.	3.860675588390091
At four hospitals in the Saarland, Germany, 45 cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period.	3.5152772222997117
In addition to the case history and clinical findings, the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased IgM titer.	4.192424867430368
None of the patients had been previously vaccinated.	3.9226622479987174
The main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination, one which has almost no side effects.	3.5295992527636115
The goal of this study is to describe the disease, present our own results, and indicate the need for vaccination.	3.8743607228489614
In addition to providing information, a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination.	3.597184384049496
Although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years, the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination.	4.544256573742872
Neurofibromas, café au lait macules and freckles in the axillary or inguinal regions are common manifestations of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (NF-1).	2.90707489854181
Less known is the simultaneous appearance of dermal melanocytic naevi.	3.230591755378045
We describe the case of a 21-year-old Vietnamese woman who showed generalized, multiple neurofibromas, a solitary plexiform neurofibroma in the left gluteal region and Lisch nodules.	3.067448607383803
In addition, there were several large grey-blue macules histologically characterized by fusiform pigment-bearing cells in the dermis, which we diagnosed as persistent aberrant mongolian spots.	2.9535864930090026
In the right zygomatic region she presented a grey-blue, hair-bearing macule, which we saw as a variant of Ota's naevus.	2.9772567858684127
A genetic background for this coincidence of a systemic with a local phakomatosis can be supposed, as both Schwann's cells and melanocytes are derived from the neural crest.	3.1342132266108655
Such pathologic rearrangement in the embryogenesis of the cellular elements could be important for the pathogenesis of NF-1 and dermal melanocytic nevi.	3.754179994513339
Infectious agents may directly or indirectly (through the response of the host's immune system) modulate the growth of vascular cells.	3.282397296095816
Local and/or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of (re-)stenosis in the vascular tree.	4.109798301068231
Further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for atherogenesis and restenosis.	3.6775999481565056
Their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions.	3.447958894133391
Besides other reasons, cost containments mandate the rational use of preoperative screening tests which should be adapted to the risk of the individual patient.	3.6957408677998527
Since the perioperative cardiac risk increases with age, elderly patients in particular require a thorough evaluation of their perioperative risk.	3.3196150811676035
Routine ECG, however, is not indicated in patients under 45 years of age who do not present with signs or history of preexisting cardiac diseases but should be performed on a routine basis in all patients over 45 years of age.	3.6897496219667825
The validity of an ergometer test as a preoperative indicator of myocardial ischemia is limited due to a high incidence of false negative results.	3.476795062470506
By preoperative routine chest radiography previously unknown findings are only detected in a small number of patients; thus, in patients of ASA-risk groups I-II younger than 74 years of age routine chest-x-ray cannot be justified.	4.00860850546934
In patients whose perioperative cardiac risk as assessed clinically and by ECG is ambiguous, dipyridamole-thallium-myocardial scintigraphy (DTMS) and dobutamine-stress-echocardiography may contribute valuable information regarding the prediction of perioperative adverse cardiac events.	2.778522949577893
In that respect, dobutamine-stress-echocardiography appears to be superior to DTMS.	3.076075457999442
The laboratory tests required in patients of different ASA-risk groups and according to their age are presented in an overview.	3.3587707122311374
Generalized muscle weakness in critically ill patients can result in prolonged periods of artificial ventilation and longer stays in the intensive care unit.	3.1580326386668154
Both neuropathic (critical illness polyneuropathy) and myopathic (critical illness myopathy) abnormalities seem to play an important role for this prolonged weakness.	2.9964853244169865
This article reviews its complex differential diagnosis with special emphasis on the current understanding of the neuromuscular syndromes.	3.408755552406098
An efficient diagnostic plan is necessary for the exclusion of other curable causes of prolonged muscle weakness even in the presence of polyneuromyopathic changes.	3.597540550444816
Psychological support of the patient and prophylaxis of secondary complications of prolonged immobilization are crucial when specific therapy is not possible.	4.042568225175832
Modern ultrasonic diagnostic instruments with high resolution and color Doppler sonography allow the obstetrician to describe pathological findings very precisely and at an early stage of pregnancy.	3.1031046641587032
The use of high-resolution ultrasound makes it possible to detect heart malformations already between the 8th and 10th week of gestation.	2.876875204667887
This development has essentially changed the clinical requirements on fetal autopsy which in its traditional way no longer meets the increased demands.	2.954883728370807
Unless the pathologists faces this challenge the importance of fetal autopsy will diminish.	3.6429988384485026
Modern image databases and communication techniques allow the pathologist to have direct access to text and images of pre-findings by other clinics.	3.05686968139997
Great importance, however, must be attached to the interdisciplinary cooperation with obstetricians and geneticists.	3.809317544983201
We report on routine fetal autopsy by using an interdisciplinary database an the Charité.	2.872569469016337
Infrainguinal arterial reconstruction for intermittent claudication has been discouraged because of fear of bypass graft failure, significant perioperative complications, and limb loss.	3.2082305619142044
This may be worse than the natural history of the disease.	2.963154672766076
In our study, we retrospectively evaluated all infrainguinal bypass procedures performed in the past 10 years.	3.2828355946200096
Radiosurgery represents a minimally invasive radiologic method for the treatment of intracranial tumours and arteriovenous malformations.	4.103686593376873
In 1994 the radiosurgical device 'Leksell Gamma Knife' (LGK) was installed in a dedicated logistic environment for outpatient treatments.	2.7004550920354733
High quality requirements have to be met for radiosurgery.	3.7761671156501935
The target point accuracy taking into account the whole system was shown to be reliably below 0.5 mm whereas the spatial therapeutic resolution was 0.035 cm3.	3.1480361301855067
Quality parameters of the dose plan were evaluated for the first 500 consecutive treatments.	4.266062840994396
These values and examples of dose plans were used to emphasize the advantages of the treatment principle with multiple isocenters.	3.998864458933581
An analysis of data in the literature revealed that there is no uniform standard of treatment available in radiosurgery.	4.729072485421701
This result could be helpful in order to proceed towards a more uniform treatment standard in radiosurgery and to improve overall treatment results.	3.6834037765883796
Even if Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever - bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations - he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections, to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of childbed fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures, especially the hand disinfection.	3.304864913203269
He has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or putride lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health-care personnel act as vehicles.	2.6740555382296014
As a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection, he noticed that generally only the weakend organism of the patient is involved as an infection target.	3.5969486144710126
The impact of his doctrine not only made him "saviour of the mothers" but also justifies to regard him as "father of the obstetric infection prevention" if not even as the founder of the modern science-based hospital hygiene.	2.938186518684503
In this paper we present a method for measuring the wear of the polyethylene inlay in knee joint endoprostheses from standard X-ray images.	3.298533691078922
Our approach is to estimate the spatial position of the tibial and femoral components of the prostheses from their contours in the X-ray image.	4.420707811102281
When we know the exact shape of these two components, we can calculate the minimal spatial distance between them which approximates the remaining thickness of the inlay.	3.511422820715551
First results show that this approach might provide sufficient accuracy for the given task.	3.7753150460975764
Most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with Borrelia Burgdorferi.	2.9602049375968575
Erythema migrans is a classical skin lesion of early borreliosis characterized by a centrifugally expanding erythema at the site of the prior tick bite.	3.23807305321159
After hematological spreading of the vector multiple erythemata migrantia occur with a very low incidence in Europe as described in the case of a 2 1/2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine.	3.5596618103266366
This means an excellent prognosis for those children with borreliosis who are treated promptly.	3.4628659727340008
Background: We compared the standard suprathreshhold strategy to the so-called threshhold splitting strategy with 5 and 2 dB steps.	3.2748624604657532
The aim of the study was to establish whether the threshhold splitting strategy had advantages over the suprathreshhold strategy that has been used to date.	3.003638448124278
Resection specimens of 14 patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three-step regression grading system: grade I, no or only slight tumor regression; grade II, incomplete tumor regression; grade III, complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue.	3.2488396938244612
In five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples, a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis, foam cell rim, vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen.	3.1377718031648327
This morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic, but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy.	3.2219543249211706
The presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci, however, argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression, which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer.	3.654377723773255
Background: The term "Castleman's diseas" (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) comprises a heterogeneous clinicopathologic entity among lymphoproliferative disorders.	2.5965992873734542
In accordance with the German law on care for helpless persons, an observer rating scale has been developed to allow a staging of need of care.	3.2894911119609787
Construction of the scale, item descriptions, definitions, algorithms for sum score and inter-rater reliability data are reported.	2.8405518810733335
The scale can reliably measure the need of care, quality of care, and who is the care provider.	4.034806154345699
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) improves the success of trabeculectomy.	3.709779963357576
Since in vitro studies showed a prolonged effect of 36 days of growth inhibition with a single dose of 5-FU, 5-FU is applied intraoperatively.	4.04189107630855
To evaluate the effect of intraoperatively applied 5-FU, we compared 13 (low-risk) patients with intraoperative application of 5-FU to a control group matched by age, diagnosis, sex and stage of glaucoma.	4.0710869152006826
Postoperatively on day 4 the IOP was significant lower (4.8 mmHg) in the 5-FU-group in comparison to the untreated group (P=0.005; power 0.80).	3.9094920042974297
After 1 week the difference decreased to 2 mmHg and was not significant any more (P=0.16).	3.259348242063174
After 1 week a lower mean intraocular pressure of 2 mmHg was found with a P-value of 0.16.	3.1471918720612613
It may be that these results are not just due to an antiproliferative mechanism; a direct toxic effect of 5-FU should be considered.	3.699446896775581
5-FU side effects such as corneal complications and inflammatory reaction were not increased in the 5-FU group.	3.7011594022993326
However, one case of persistent hypotony was seen in the 5-FU group.	3.7431375212128692
This study found intraoperative use of 5-FU to be a safe procedure with a pronounced capacity to lower IOP in the direct postoperative phase.	3.729554077733653
However, this effect may not be based on an antiproliferative effect alone, but might be of toxic origin.	3.931670223672147
A postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery.	3.4942516046418053
Clinical signs, laboratory findings, ultrasound and ERC lead to diagnosis.	3.068655855561899
We report on 40 cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube.	2.9900683151838905
In all patients the fistula healed within 7 days after placement of the tube.	3.1732422139756085
Two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess, and in 2 patients drainage of a bilioma was performed.	3.7627933181821183
In 2 cases with biliary peritonitis, a step-by-step lavage was necessary.	2.953600636867457
The nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract.	3.3574407332999225
Description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes, which requires dialysis, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, who developed fulminant systemic calciphylaxis after successful renal transplantation.	3.5012957408785783
Characteristic of this syndrome, there occured soft tissue calcification, mediacalcinosis of the small and medium-sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis.	3.252697221316032
The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but challenging agents like corticosteroids or immunsuppressants, in a sensitized organism (at hypercalcemia or elevated parathormon) could lead to calcium deposits.	3.083909792695386
These are showing a particular affinity for elastic tissue.	3.0359880446004173
Lungs, stomach, kidneys, cutis, heart and vascular system are most frequently involved.	3.635262390742658
Treatment is primarily supportive; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis.	3.306112652889478
Contact urticaria and anaphylactic reactions to latex-containing rubber products are being recognized with increasing frequency in all kinds of medical disciplines.	3.309358403185952
Recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy.	4.617050236821942
The cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented, and the importance of the association of latex and cross-reactivity with food items is stressed.	3.932310579078151
The food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado; banana, avocado and buckwheat; and banana, avocado and tomato.	2.5943173094721246
The cross-reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before.	2.9390816892070712
The branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR syndrome) is characterized by auricular abnormalities, lateral cervical fistulas and preauricular tags.	3.1387602002497443
The hearing impairment may be a conductive, a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss.	3.3310134986150146
The renal disease is oligomeganephronia, a bilateral, congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of nephrons.	3.052704024523144
The BOR syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disease.	3.747169607985474
Corneal metabolism is reduced after cataract extraction.	3.4130324715783145
The available literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts.	3.223007127665678
The CO2 laser myringotomy is a current low-pain procedure for middle-ear ventilation for secretory otitis media (SOM) that can be performed under topical anesthesia, even in children.	3.3314451773489018
The duration of middle-ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created.	3.4804793412139046
Perforations with a diameter greater than 2 mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately 3 weeks, thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes.	3.4069489522340666
To date, the CO2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope.	3.1788909579174693
The CO2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system.	3.628546123761293
The incorporation of a small inexpen-sive CO2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in SOM therapy.	2.899576136466713
However, no data are available for urological malignancies treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.	3.2401705618367753
Aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of pretreatment with amifostine in terms of prevention of renal, hematopoetic and neurologic toxicity.	3.4585363624835734
17 patients (mean age: 62.6 [45-74]) with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder received inductive or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy (1-6 cycles) with a cisplatin dose of 70 mg/m2.	3.705153278209051
Amifostine (740-910 mg/m2) was administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy.	3.3935234062700257
For all patients creatinine clearance, serum creatinine and electrolytes including magnesium, and blood cell count were determined prior to and after each cycle.	3.091830546036289
A group of 12 patients (mean age: 61.9 [51-67]) did undergo MVEC chemotherapy (1-4 cycles) without receiving amifostine and served as control group.	3.4182362463244154
Amifostine was well tolerated and only 1 patient suffered from gastrointestinal discomfort, blood pressure remained unchanged in all patients.	3.9977413324423914
Amifostine prevented a significant reduction of creatinine clearance even in the 2 patients with known renal insufficiency: mean creatinine clearance was 125  +/-  20 ml/min prior to and 115  +/-  25 ml/min after chemotherapy.	3.726136617502211
In the control group, however, creatinine clearance dropped from 121  +/-  30 ml/min to 85  +/-  20 ml/min after completion of MVEC chemotherapy.	3.6598881703041197
Serum creatinine levels did not increase significantly (1.1 mg/dl prior to and 1.2 mg/dl after chemotherapy), magnesium levels did not decrease significantly and normalized at the end of chemotherapy.	3.808416129536878
Significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 29 % and 12 % of the patients in the amifostine group and in 67 % and 33 % of the patients in the control group.	4.41878052127784
Amifostine was shown to have a protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in the elderly patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy.	3.9733499894124416
Based on our data amifostine should be applied in the supportive management to prevent chemotherapy induced complications.	3.169320256725625
Immunophenotyping of leukocyte differentiation antigens may also be of limited diagnostic value due to the small  number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.	3.9484878656316122
Molecular methods may support the specific diagnosis of leptomeningeal infiltration of CLL.	3.22011433765946
Despite clinical signs of leptomeningeal  involvement neither magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nor conventional CSF analysis were suggestive of lymphomatous meningitis.	2.964905184922196
Using PCR we selectively amplified the highly variable and clone-specific CDR3 region of the locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) in DNA obtained from both CSF and peripheral blood cells.	2.9566881623540553
Analysis of PCR products by high resolution gel electrophoresis revealed a single DNA fragment respectively indicating the presence of a  monoclonal cell population in both  compartments.	3.1276441134747714
DNA sequence analysis of the amplified CDR3 segments confirmed the clonal identity of cells and the leptomeningeal dissemination of CLL.	3.37064827112066
In the orthopedic department of the University Hospital Homburg/Saar, we use since 1993 a computer-based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations.	3.5566299834243744
Hardware consists of DOS/Windows PC's in a Novell-network.	2.9016214841194765
Our software is a combination of datbase-system for managing patient-data and a special coding program for ICD and IKPM-digits.	3.2677223594291007
Our experience shows that computer assisted clinic-management is an effective tool to help the surgeon in planning and documentation.	3.4912291920729266
Until now, we used the system for 31 500 patients and 8500 operations.	3.425159254208933
A flexible software can meet the requirements both of the surgeons and administration.	3.3952561794939258
Moreover, in the University hospital Homburg/Saar, the different departments are linked by an Intranet with connection to other scientific networks and the Internet.	3.094681408649103
In one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology, a vulvovaginitis can be diagnosed.	3.256308336682333
Etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene, foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections.	3.293873158487443
The microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli, and in case of chronical-recurrent discharge also B. fragilis and peptostreptococci.	3.340271290342127
The symptoms are itching, burning, dysuria, discharge and rubor of the vulva.	2.8145031415425703
A systemic application of antibiotics is not necessary, a local treatment with antibiotic solutions is contraindicated and the usual vaginal suppositories are unsuitable for girls.	3.372071757674584
A desinfection often irritates the vulvovaginal region of little girls so that for years we use estriol ointment only which is tolerated.	2.807483006419963
Excellently, a single-dose application being sufficient; burning, itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence, so that the healing process is accelerated.	3.5760409975157206
The author gives a short overview of the psychodynamic and psychoanalytic basics of psychotherapy with guided affective imagery.	2.937604079069376
The differences of the imaginations of neurotic patients and patients with severe personality disorders are demonstrated and discussed.	3.8440670355684916
Two clinical cases are described in detail which show the special elements of symbol formation on different levels of ego-structure.	3.355487966543511
Then the most important results of the recent infant research and the research of attachment behaviour, especially those of the group of Fonagy, and their importance for the theory of symbol formation are discussed.	4.260155669510566
The theory of potential space is used as a base for understanding imaginative processes.	3.332963325676489
General and special technical recommandations for the treatment of borderline cases with guided affective imagery are derived.	3.64342102210042
Especially the relationship to the theories of Bion, Ogden and Winnicott is estimated.	2.977836857867484
The situation of psychiatric patients in the Ukraine is determined by the financial and economic difficulties of this country.	3.652694979335796
In the larger cities, so-called polyclinics take care of ambulant psychiatric patients.	3.245820030643366
However, no other social psychiatric institutions exist.	2.9256393674017205
Here, the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in Kiev and Shitomir as examples.	3.214361850930936
Undertreatment is also a problem, because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the Ukraine.	4.2394040585018145
Import of new psychopharmacological agents is hampered by economical problems.	3.2717805322110887
Improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in Ukraine.	3.222907136012997
Renal lesions are frequently encountered in blunt pediatric abdominal trauma.	3.2764422629102694
From 1976 to 1996, 308 children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department.	3.4488662501914313
Patients were evaluated using abdominal paracentesis, ultrasonography, and urinary analysis.	3.149034073313149
In specific cases, IV urography, CT scan, and/or angiography were applied.	3.635996179995192
We used the Organ Injury Scale (OIS) for classification of renal trauma into five grades.	2.8076843199502597
The result of a B-scan ultrasound examination is strongly dependent on the type of the used B-system, the chosen system parameters and the experience and critical analysis of the clinical investigator.	3.8005272384652797
The estimation of quantitative acoustic parameters, independent of the type of the used B-system, is one way to overcome the subjective nature and the problems of the interpretation of B-scan images.	3.7315507032668376
Results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented.	3.096531178523288
329 persons were interviewed three times (quantitative study) and 20 persons conducted a semi-structured diary (qualitative study), covering in both groups a two-year period (from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement).	3.218447246430679
They were asked about their subjective well-being (happiness, joy, satisfaction, stresses), their life situation and their personal, social and material resources.	3.0069146513753644
Specific analyses point out inter-individual differences, risk factors and resources, like a high level of trait well-being, health, social networks and an optimistic outlook.	3.3201966033666532
The diary analyses lead to specifications, more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects.	2.984910137202553
Consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed.	3.3170432120570874
Intraoperative complications can be divided into three categories on the basis of the time of their occurrence: Group I - Problems associated with access; group II: introduction of the endovascular stent (a: release of the main segment, b: anchoring the second limb); and group III: incidence of primary endoleaks.	3.847587461218419
Interferon alpha and gamma have been used to treat several hepatic, hematological and oncological diseases for years.	3.5926097855426304
Recently, interferon beta has been introduced as a therapeutic agent in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.	3.1448636508075616
A 41-year-old female patient with multiple sclerosis developed non-tender, palm-sized, cutaneous-subcutaneous, reddish infiltrates at the injection sites on her thighs after 8 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta injections.	2.9280411376722544
Histopathology revealed a perivascular lymphoid infiltrate of the dermis and a subtle lobular lymphoid infiltrate of the subcutis.	2.9196080224914653
Interferon beta therapy was discontinued for 4 weeks.	3.367018491660697
With topical corticosteroids, the skin lesions resolved.	3.9109894681268833
When subcutaneous injections were resumed at a reduced dose, only erythema around injection sites developed without induration or pain.	3.0026968573145965
Slight erythema and swelling at interferon beta injection site are frequent and rare cases of cutaneous necrosis have been described.	3.3651354015798414
However, no reports of large, painful, cutaneous-subcutaneous infiltrates after interferon beta therapy have been published.	2.8008897822806866
In adults, infectious spondylitis is a rare but severe disease, caused by a bacterial thrombus in tissue of reduced resistance.	3.654068150794535
In conventional radiographs initial findings are a narrowing of the intervertebral space, local osteoporosis and poorly defined erosive borders of the vertebral endplates.	3.5426854465409012
These changings can be found at least three to six weeks after the onset of disease.	4.531438379214199
However, in Szintigraphy and MRT pathologic alterations are evident after ten to twelve days.	2.6669808483430666
Thus, early diagnosis and treatment becomes possible.	3.872920195701153
In early stages of the disease a localized lysis surrounded by a reactive sclerosis appears in predisposed areas of the vertebral body (subchondral, anterobasal, ventral, central).	3.017471277699448
Apparently, a soft tissue tumor is associated.	4.051867259760059
Sclerosis and reduction of the soft tissue tumor are the first signs of repair processes.	4.443631418933006
In addition, MRT as well as CT can be helpful in the detection and localization of complications as abscesses or affection of the vertebral canal.	4.090147244740198
The tuberculous spondylitis can sometimes cause difficulties in differential diagnosis.	2.752842177533069
Clinical findings, affection of several vertebral bodies, large soft tissue tumors with appearance of calcification as well as not typical locations are strongly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis, but these findings are not specific of the disease.	3.5706045946697254
Degenerative disorders such as erosive osteochondrosis or changings due to chronic dialysis (e. g. amyloid or crystal arthropathies) may cause even more problems in differential diagnosis.	3.021877839897915
Typical for a blastomatous process is the integrity of the interverebral disc space, which is a rare finding in spondylitis.	4.124648298796902
To show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot.	3.556073995459124
We examinated 10 cadaver foots of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial 20 healthy patients with 10 to 20-MHz-probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region.	3.257633059219458
Especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic (saving of expenses, lack of radiation, side-to-side comparison).	3.6408185796358232
An essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment (melanins).	2.9956026693475546
Toxicological studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration.	3.8152464949338034
As the available vocabulary for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the viewer, it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow objectivation of hair colour.	3.6497692680400093
The natural hair colour of 17 subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart (Wella, Darmstadt, Germany).	2.969470825664925
Subsequently the colours of the hair and the samples of the hair colour chart used for comparison were measured by colorimetric analysis and the CIEL*a*b* values were determined.	3.6137834064398104
The descriptive categorisation of the hair colours (e.g.	3.1288267968827514
blonde, brown, black) could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results.	3.1716574753265965
Sometimes considerable differences were also found between the colour values of the natural hair samples and the specimens used for comparison.	3.721569555089513
When the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible.	4.381483005303607
We measured the ventilatory pattern and additional work of breathing (WOBadd) at three different levels of inspiratory pressure support [IPS 5, 10, 15 mbar above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)] and in a new ventilatory mode, automatic tube compensation (ATC), in nine operative patients without lung injury nine patients ventilated for several following acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).	3.108184981919719
In ATC, endotracheal tube resistance is compensated automatically by means of closed-loop control of the calculated tracheal pressure.	3.826677360307788
Pressure support in this mode, i. e. airway pressure above PEEP, is equal to the actual flow-dependent pressure drop across the endotracheal tube (ETT).	3.532111092183233
Airway pressure rises at the beginning of inspiration and falls towards the end.	3.631612923224365
As the tube resistance of ETT seriously hinders expiration and can cause desynchronization between ventilator and patient, airway pressure is reduced below PEEP during expiration in the same way as it is increased during inspiration.	3.1078496781591864
The result is a near-constant tracheal pressure at PEEP both during inspiration and during expiration.	2.7948078292425667
This mode could be best termed as "electronic extubation".	2.8961803572622276
The most striking difference between the postoperative patients and the ARI patients was their minute ventilation (17.8+/-1.85 l/min in ARI patients vs 7.3+/-3.1 l/min in the postoperative patients).	3.7816819277509475
In the postoperative patients augmentation of IPS from 5 to 15 mbar induced a steady increase in tidal volume (VT) and a consecutive decrease in respiratory rate (rr) compared with ATC (VTATC,postop= 463+/-78 ml; rrATC,postop =16+/-4 min-1; VTIPS5,postop = 505+/-79 ml; rrIPS5,postop = 15+/-4 min-1; VTIPS10,postop = 562+/-86 ml; rrIPS15,postop =14+/-4 min-1; VTIPS15,postop=660+/- 151 ml; rrTPS15, postop = 12+/-4 min-1), whereas the augmentation of IPS of 5 and 10 mbar in the ARI patients could not compensate for the increase in rr and the decrease in VT, after switching from ATC to IPS (VTATC,ARI 724+/-308 ml, rrATC,ARI = 24+/-6 min-1; VTIPS5,ARI = 649+/-315 ml; rrIPS 5,ARI = 27+/-8 min-1; VTIPS10,ARI=653+/-353 ml; rrIPS10,ARI = 25+/-8 min-1: Even IPS 15 was not able to reestablish VT at the values observed during ATC (VTIPS15,ARI =680+/-312 ml).	2.9896493614135395
During ATC WOBadd was small in both postoperative and ARI patients (WOBadd,ATC,postop = 93+/-36 mJ/l, WOBadd,ATC,ARI =116 +/-72 mJ/l).	3.019314003062184
In the postoperative patients, an inspiratory pressure support of 5 mbar was not sufficient to compensate WOBadd compared with ATC.	3.439156570965019
However, IPS 10 and 15 mbar were able to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd.ATC5,postop WOBadd,IPS5,postop =189+/-77 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS10,postop = 55+/-30 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS15,postop = 21+/-11 mJ/l).	2.962306320081643
Under ATC, WOBadd was only 15% of WOBadd under IPS of 15 mbar.	3.0780134403034247
All but two patients were successfully extubated after the investigation.	3.80552326004348
These two patients were not extubated because they were dependent on an FIO2 >0.5.	3.470257495800053
Our results strongly indicate that ventilatory dependence in ARI patients may be caused by the ETT rather than by mechanical dysfunction of the lung.	3.85275376747383
ATC is a very helpful mode to use in distinguishing between ventilatory failure caused by ETT and real ventilatory dependence.	3.562585687345691
The preoperative localization of pharmaco-resistent focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance.	3.301989339160832
In addition to conventional MRI diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HMR spectroscopy) can be useful for assessing the bilaterality of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	3.1719811007201497
The technique and findings of HMR spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	3.4305893212722984
The findings indicate that chemical shift imaging (CSI) investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery.	3.1152144513446944
This paper describes the conceptual considerations in planning and realizing an inpatient unit for traumatized patients.	2.7138789513785575
The different concepts of the dynamic of the traumatic disease and the aetiopathology of posttraumatic stressdisease (PTSD) are highly significant in regard to the realisation of differing concepts of inpatient therapy of trauma.	3.359945895930878
The utilisation of Konzentrative Bewegungstherapy (KBT) and Creative Therapy in our conflict- and solution-oriented analytic concept permits us to neglect a fictitious contradiction between traumaexposure and traumalimitation and a "potential space" (Winnicott) can be opened to the creative work with the patients.	2.8625426586710065
This paper illustrates with some casuistic examples the utilisation of KBT in transforming the traumatic body-flashbacks into narrative memory-scripts, by the use of symbolizing processes.	2.9791798160746046
In 55 consecutive patients with the same dual chamber pacemaker (Relay, Intermedics) and different pacing leads, the influence of different safety margins for pacing on battery current was investigated.	3.589259684429629
2.8 +/- 0.9 years after implantation, atrial and ventricular pulse-width thresholds (tRS) (ms) were determined at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 V, and the charge delivered at threshold was telemetered.	3.7278237373751146
If tRS was <1.50 ms at 0.5 V, an amplitude of 1.0 V was programmed in the atrium and the ventricule; if tRS was <1.50 ms at 1.0 V, then an amplitude of 2.0 V was chosen.	2.820111012679955
Two times the charge threshold (2x QRS), two times the voltage threshold (2x URS), and three times the pulse-width threshold (3x tRS) were programmed as the safety margins for pacing.	3.5980757274075117
With every safety margin, battery current (IRS) (µA) was averaged from 5 telemetric readings in D00 mode with 70 bpm.	2.9596824172632124
IBat was significantly lower with 2x QRS as compared with 2x URS (13.43 +/- 1.0 vs. 14.20 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (13.99 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.05).	2.823678501331042
Pacemaker longevity derived from these current data was significantly longer with 2x QRS (112 +/- 8 months) as compared with 2x URS (106 +/- 9, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (108 +/- 8, p<0.05).	3.380409195247916
If current consumption is compared intraindividually in dependance on the programmed amplitude, battery current is significantly lower at 1.0 V as compared with 2.0 V resulting in a mean reduction of 0.63 µA (-4.9%, p<0.05) and an average gain in longevity of 5 months.	3.355653703692735
This applies to every safety margin tested.	3.211337551797392
Differences in battery current caused by the safety margins will translate into a greater gain in longevity in future pacemaker models with reduced internal current consumption.	3.1982498692568697
Any medical procedure must be legally authorized by the patient, giving informed consent.	3.9869793863552263
This prerequisite is based on the right to self determination.	4.941002188424834
Otherwise a medical procedure is considered as physical injury.	3.9116938922301445
Thus, the way, how a specific procedure is performed, predominantly depends on the patient's will.	4.001188526596769
The attending physician's duty is to find out this will, which is especially important when old patients and patients incapable of giving valid consent are involved.	3.562338098606126
Before the procedure the physician has to have a confidential talk with the patient.	3.8975275585863725
He has to point out the best treatment possible considering the individual circumstances of the patient's life.	3.7446350939138653
The physician has to find out, weather the patient is competent to refuse or consent to treatement.	3.7378565254840703
Furthermore the consultation is an opportunity to diminish the patient's fear and to increase his confidence.	3.058082481258818
The main problem treating old patients is that they often lack the mental ability for appreciation of the nature of the situation.	3.252203167857594
One has to differentiate between the physiological mental decay and dementia or psychiatric diseases.	3.5654458957843547
In these cases a third party consent is necessary.	2.965742872044682
This review of German neurology during the Nazi era mentions first the significance of Jewish neurologists for the history of the specialty, and the irreplaceable loss that their expulsion from Germany represented.	3.405092083905221
A brief discussion of the scientific accomplishments of German neurologists during this time is followed by a description of violations of ethical principles, exemplified by the human experiments of G. Schaltenbrand.	3.3040055920997045
The spirit of the age exerted a malevelent influence.	3.2018430525059967
A postal survey targeted at 1000 firms in the metal- and electronic working industry of Northrhine Westfalia was carried out by Sozialforschungsstelle Dortmund und Institute of geronotology to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement.	3.0428971599744923
As the results show, firms in Northrhine Westfalia are willing to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve.	3.082158807053702
Firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement.	3.6034247602080907
Therefore partial retirement is created as a so-called "blocked model".	3.522447336956773
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients had a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implanted.	3.651789938467121
Mean age was 64  +/-  9 years, 278 male and 62 female.	3.404948174324601
60% of patients had coronary artery disease and 31% dilative cardiomyopathy.	4.4176011985248795
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was in 57% of patients ventricular tachycardia, in 43% ventricular fibrillation.	3.2642195356375243
298 patients had a single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator implanted, 42 patients a dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator.	3.8629626607988694
In 25 patients additional subcutaneous patch or array electrodes and in 2 patients additional epicardial patch electrodes were implanted.	3.1711946808972704
Implantation site was in 92 patients abdominal and in 248 pectoral.	3.275409989072103
Over a period of 7 years 34 lead-related complications occured in 33 patients (9.7%), after a median of 2 months after implantation.	3.3716986067976453
Diagnosis was made by routine chest x-ray in about 55% of lead-related complications, by clinical presentation (inadequate therapy, pain) in 24%, and by electrical parameters in 21%.	3.41310250566032
In patients with an abdominal implantation site, lead-related complications occurred in 20%, in contrast to 6% in patients with a pectoral implantation site.	4.500040037479722
Regarding patients with pectoral implantation site, lead-related complications were observed in 12% of patients with a dual-chamber ICD vs 4% with a single-chamber ICD (p = 0.05), due to dislocation of atrial electrodes with dual-chamber ICD.	4.1831711842867305
There were no differences in clinical parameters between patients with pectoral vs abdominal and between single vs dual-chamber ICD.	2.8765926984953176
Several new approaches are available for early defibrillation.	4.04897384301865
One example is semiautomatic defibrillators used by the first arriving emergency staff.	3.076561045118673
The recommendations for introducing emergency medical technician (EMT) defibrillation in Germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor-manned-ambulances or the experiences of the German multi-center-study.	3.331592918997995
This analysis intends to contribute data to an EMT defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous-system.	3.0221289807808773
Methods: In a prospective study a EMT-defibrillation group (= DG) was compared with a standard group (basic life support by EMTs and defibrillation by emergency physicians) (= SG) and a control group (emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with EMTs) (= CG).	3.4431031390516647
In the DG semiautomatic defibrillators from Laerdal (Heartstart 3000) were used.	2.86390239232953
Successfully resuscitated patients were followed up with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the Pittsburgh Brain Stem Score (PBSS), and Pittsburgh Cerebral (CPC) and Overall Performance Categorie (OPC).	3.405070624629028
Results: Over 13 months 43 patients were included, primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation (VF).	3.1706745395425413
Depending on the first arriving emergency staff the patients were allocated to the DG (n = 12), to the SG (n = 18) or to the CG (n = 13).	3.6520564903785755
DG and SG did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long-term prognosis (primary successful 8.3% vs. 38.9%, definite successful 0% vs. 27.8%).	3.15163869188893
In the long term survival rate there were no significant differences.	3.449645778180453
In the DG significantly less patients received bystander CPR (8.3%) than in the other groups (55.6% and 69.2%).	3.0469559513551796
Neither the variable "witnessed collapes" nor "bystander CPR" had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study.	3.3944306145954775
The average response time for the first arriving rescue team was 5.5 +/- 2.4 min, without a significant difference between the groups.	3.7365080377764786
Conclusions: A comparison of this study with American, European and German recommendations for EMT defibrillation programms revealed some deviations.	3.561700856690047
Bystander CPR seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician.	4.333756961474202
A benefit of EMT defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our "rendezvous-system", possibly because the time interval was less than 4 min (3.5 min).	3.8013712828032866
Since the result is in accordance with the German multi-center-study, a critical consideration of a EMT defibrillation program seems to be necessary in "Rendezvous-systems".	3.5209990790134515
Ninety-two strains of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) from 80 patients of 31 hospitals in 11 federal states were analyzed.	2.768398456654532
They were primarily isolated in intensive care units (general, surgical, internistic, pediatric, oncological ones), but also in nephrologic/dialysis or neurologic/orthopaedic wards.	3.1833956047095695
A dominance of VanA type E. faecium strains was observed (n=81; 88.0%).	3.089947064829338
In addition, strains of E. faecalis (VanA; n=4; 4.4%), E. faecium (VanB; n=1; 1.1%), and E. gallinarum (VanC1, n=6; 6.5%) were found.	3.1093179472560397
The 81 VanA strains of E. faecium possessed the following resistances to other antibiotics: erythromycin, ciprofloxacin (both 93.8%), ampicillin, oxytetracycline (both 88.9%), rifampicin (79.0%), trimethoprim/sulfameracin (61.7%), chloramphenicol (18.9%), fusidic acid (12.3%), quinupristin/dalfopristin (7.4%); gentamicin (46.9%) and streptomycin (37.0%), also together with ampicillin resistance (9.9-35.8%).	2.456691976675757
In some of these VanA type strains resistance to teicoplanin cannot be completely expressed in-vitro.	3.186282139736524
Macrorestriction analysis of E. faecium outbreak isolates (VanA type) from hospitals in different federal states indicated an intra- and interhospital spread of a defined strain.	3.197100570054437
However, heterogeneous plasmid and plasmid restriction patterns showed that these strains were not completely identical.	2.8790976066703156
This case report of 3 patients shows the variety of possible injuries combined with SD.	3.495311774487784
Diagnosis and therapy in such a rare trauma, which is most likely seen in specialized trauma centres are being described.	3.6959853654642703
The 3 patients are presented from trauma to management, with remarks to various possibilities in treatment.	3.4094731869234804
Reports of other groups include multicenter studies with small numbers of patients, making it different to look for homogenity or defining standards, whereas current guidelines are being mentioned, including remarks on the management of these mostly polytraumatized and vitally endangered patients.	3.13387650653028
This is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56-year-old male.	3.2436447067135434
Recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis, as the patient could not remember any trauma.	4.524133464099472
After performing MRI, a 12 x 5 mm signal-free zone showed up in the area of the lateral condylus femoris, which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed.	3.709209021446966
The patient was discharged soon after without any complaints.	2.893773532624328
Many patients with acquired strabismus do not suffer from diplopia and confusion after an individually and age-dependent interval.	3.0843770991743384
They inhibit the image of the deviated eye by binocular rilvary and particularly by the physiological ability to disregard visually disturbing stimuli.	3.113383284845802
Modern filtration- and apheresis-techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of <1x106 per unit.	3.597919224727017
The best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised prestorage-filtration.	2.9945373417697305
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and to exclude in special cases bacterial septicaemia.	3.9651465075212515
In addition, there are references to reduce the postoperative infections, the rate of recurrence of a tumor and the postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.	4.799666218095436
The use of leucocyte-depleted blood components for special indications is meanwhile established.	2.92513992704727
Some European countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes.	3.334244734879107
The authors recommend the general leucocyte-depletion of blood components considering the German medical law (AMG) and cost/benefit ratio.	2.9402547725521533
Evaluation of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment frequently uses rating scales without regard for patients' defensiveness.	2.9744726473215826
This study demonstrates on 309 psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy and followed-up 1 year after treatment that defensiveness, measured with validity scales of personality inventories MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gießen-Test, influences ratings (scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES) before and after therapy.	2.6153893514514523
Patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up.	2.412150047431188
The extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in frankness in these patients, indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales.	3.562093001048774
Inpatient client-centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self-criticism and diminished it in the case of initial retentiveness.	3.701579965207496
Introduction: Because of their frequency and consequences sciatica remains a demanding clinical entity with significant social and economical impact.	3.07993801279316
There is a high demand on therapeutic modalities, using folk medicine methods in the treatment of orthopaedic  diseases.	3.8612907142302904
No data is available on the usefullness of methods like natural herbs in combination with acupuncture.	3.6383859013340913
Aim of our study was to present data on the effect of acupuncture and cytokineinhibiting natural herbs in sciatic pain.	3.626277214453133
We compared these  results with nerve root infiltration by local anaesthetics and corticosteroids in our  orthopaedic outpatient clinic.	3.2141036510451904
All three therapeutical modalities showed improvement of pain scores.	3.048402001739388
Best  results were gained with steroid injection (n=26; 66% pain reduction), acupuncture in combination with herbs improved the pain in average of 62% (n=230), whereas injection with local anaesthetic had a pain reduction of 48% (n=22).	3.3407914114088473
Sole Mepivacain-HCl treatment had significant less pain reduction compared to the other treatment modalities.	3.6879071240872405
Conclusion: According to our results acupuncture in combination with herbs and  steroid nerve blocks appear to be an effective and thus recommendable conservative  therapy in cases of sciatic pain.	3.680511465013658
Taking into account that patients increasingly prefer ethnomedical modalities of treatment our study gains importance for practising  orthopaedists.	2.8473103950419296
This paper concerns advances in the integration of psychotherapy in psychiatric education and clinical practice and whether they go along with increasing research activities.	3.4321173534690166
To find answers, a survey on psychotherapy research was carried out in all German psychiatric hospitals and departments by means of a questionnaire.	3.4737969611154815
The results indicate that psychotherapy research is done nearly exclusively in university hospitals.	3.0838701408975133
About half of them had already published psychotherapy studies and two thirds of them are presently carrying out studies, mostly including prospective, randomized clinical trials.	3.5097046620677412
These studies cover the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders: substance abuse, schizophrenic and affective disorders, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive and personality disorders.	3.0373951328308375
To improve psychotherapy research conditions further, efforts are necessary to increase scientific exchange, financial support, and the integration of institutions outside the universities.	3.7005653225378974
There is little to suggest that the course of preeclamsia can be substantially affected by drug treatment.	3.7109327669012258
The vast majority of randomized studies do not indicate beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria, fetal heart rate abnormalities, abruptio placentae and the incidence of preterm birth.	3.2343189636481786
Moreover, blood pressure lowering agents fail to improve uteroplacental perfusion but may have adverse effects on fetal growth.	3.328021358471255
Antihypertensive treatment is only indicated in severe hypertension ( > 170/110 mm Hg) to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage.	3.7886599001827905
Dihydralazine injections may result in reduced placental blood flow and fetal distress.	3.9391510399028813
Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism of eclamptic seizure is cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant ischemia.	3.2814920387425226
Cerebral vessels are particularly sensitive to magnesium, which works by reversing cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant improvement in blood flow.	3.0012601436159794
Controlled trials have shown magnesium to be superior to both placebo and phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia.	3.55373937798456
Furthermore, magnesium has been found to be more effective than diazepam and phenytoin in preventing recurrence of seizures in women with eclampsia.	3.3199619224040613
Also the neonatal outcome favors magnesium, which is now generally accepted as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.	3.890770240224337
Baker's cysts were treated operatively in 19 patients in the Department of Traumatology of the University of Cologne from 1988 to 1997.	4.239783216464908
The subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography (follow-up: 95 %).	4.19838313768173
We differentiated between the congenital primary cyst (39 %), and the secondary form, which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion (61 %).	4.749881063144721
Arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of Baker's cyst.	3.741693621148831
Postoperative complications were two reinterventions due to one hematoma and one effusion.	3.0114104927466347
Patient's evaluation of operation result was "excellent" in 61 % and "good" in 39 % of cases.	3.3540908518108496
There was only one case of a recurrent cyst.	4.230339553364958
The primary form of Baker's cyst has always to be extirpated, according to our clinical experience.	3.2853447293083415
The extirpation of the secondary Baker's cyst and the relevance of arthroscopy and treatment of the basic disease have to be discussed.	4.511572129632268
In median avcuate ligament syndrome, compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.	3.6382457439804865
A lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment.	3.6551506042136364
Depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways, the symptoms vary considerably.	3.867249018870162
We report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two-vessel involvement.	2.835299021034085
In such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit.	3.1426487022677767
Usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient.	3.2115744130467276
Bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow.	3.4733181159738704
The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique.	3.666866141505136
However, the expertise required is a major disadvantage.	3.332158856433867
Recently, methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available.	2.9609286412292155
The use of an antigen-capture assay for the detection of histidine-rich protein 2, an antigen specific for Plasmodium falciparum, forms the basis of the ParaSight-F (Becton Dickinson) and the ICT Malaria Pf test (ICT Diagnostics).	3.0900934169084167
Parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another immunographic dipstick assay developed by Flow Inc.	3.60720105084066
These currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and specificities of 90-100%.	3.6606761179435203
A decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low parasitemia.	4.44399531231103
However, false-negative  results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities.	3.9473388900875954
Purpose: Discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes.	4.014783299040198
There is no information about the frequency of nerve lesions after revascularization of the lower limb.	3.952629881573387
Methods: Between 1992 and 1996, 436 patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization, including 147 cases of deep revascularization, 127 supra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses, 116 infra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses and 56 femoro-crural bypasses.	2.559438961671052
Mean patient age was 70.5 +/- 5.8 years; 182 patients were female and 254 were male.	3.0927012470157416
There was a 38% rate (166/436) of reoperation.	2.8070039798378352
All patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation, including the methods of Weber and Moberg.	3.2716320314018406
Results: We found eleven patients (4%) with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation.	3.9519296643777775
After the reoperation 55 patients (33%) had nerve lesions.	3.230218397554176
Conclusions: Peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15% of our patients on discharge from hospital.	3.961250276420066
They had mainly dysesthesia and hypesthesia but no kind of motor dysfunction.	2.800586238454184
In our opinion, detailed preoperative information is very important because of the risk of sensitive nerve lesions.	3.7721123261172766
Classic and HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) are predominantly found in male Caucasians.	3.2615175252448863
It is unclear why KS is so rare in women.	2.9484841987762525
At the Department of Dermatology, University of Frankfurt, epidemic KS was diagnosed in 299/751 (40%) male and 5/72 (18%) female HIV-infected patients.	3.2493183697364714
To detect common parameters regarding immunodeficiency, hormonal disturbances, abnormalities in clinical course, or sexual practices, data of eight women with KS (five HIV+, three HIV-) were compared.	3.3717446253296224
In HIV+ women KS is more aggressive than in HIV- women and more aggressive than in HIV+ men.	3.160848052115454
Early and frequent visceral involvement and no preference for the lower extremities are found.	3.663408583331075
Compared to HIV- women with KS, HIV+ women are generally younger (mean age 38 vs 71 years) and significantly immunodeficient (reduced absolute CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio).	3.130318212386873
All women with KS investigated for sexual hormones (7/8) showed abnormalities: 7/7 had low oestrogens, 4/6 low LH and 3/5 low progesterone.	3.231164644904181
Controls (n=11, HIV+ without KS) showed a clear trend for higher serum levels of sexual hormones, but the difference was not significant.	3.5234894061671747
Although different reasons for low levels of oestrogens (drug abuse, marasmus, menopause) must be considered, the lack of oestrogens seems to be a common finding in HIV+ and HIV- women with KS.	3.9211902000386294
There was no correlation between sexual practices (anal or oral-faecal contacts) and the manifestation or aggressiveness of KS.	2.9650082136574665
The aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement (AVR) due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired LV systolic function prior to surgery.	3.7746986529384223
74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (29 female, 45 male, mean age 66  +/-  18 years) were divided into 2 groups according to LV ejection fraction (EF): Group 1 with EF > 50% (n = 40); Group 2 with EF <= 50% (n = 34).	3.580556130619995
Furthermore, patients were differentiated into a group A without (n = 53) and a group B with aortic regurgitation (<= II °, n = 21).	3.71774270570949
All patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 month after surgery.	3.5934441580828307
There was a significant decrease of LV enddiastolic and endsystolic valume indices following AVR in group 2 and group B.	2.9177513946545255
Patients with preoperatively lower EF (group 2) showed an increase in LV ejection fraction from 39  +/-  10% before AVR to 47  +/-  11% after AVR (p < 0.001), whereas patients with preoperative normal EF (group 1) showed a significant decrease in EF (from 62  +/-  8% to 57  +/-  10%, p < 0.05).	4.024337647665283
Also patients with combined aortic valve disease before AVR had an increase of EF after surgery (from 45 %plusmn; 14% to 56  +/-  14%, p < 0.03).	3.464184288117867
There were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and LV posterior wall thickness in group 1 and group A, whereas a significant decrease of LV anddiastolic diameter index was noted only in group B.	3.1622261003471848
Improvement of the NYHA functional class could be demonstrated in group 2 from 2.8  +/-  0.7 before to 2.2  +/-  0.6 after AVR, as well as in group B from 2.9  +/-  0.7 before to 1.9  +/-  0.7 after surgery.	3.6328852204534057
In conclusion, patients with impaired LV function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after AVR, while patients with normal LV function presented a slight decrease of EF.	3.7167839065200905
There was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status.	3.832098589878408
Cardiomyocytes lose the ability to proliferate after birth.	3.758091826130355
Subsequently, irreversible cellular damage, e.g., during myocardial infarction, causes loss of functional properties and cell replacement by fibrotic tissue.	3.358730170888284
It is, therefore, not surprising that cell replacement strategies such as cardiomyocyte transplantation in damaged myocardium or scar tissue has gained widespread interest.	2.9914242789067016
In other species such as mice, rats, and dogs, the technical feasibility of skeletal myoblast-, satellite cell-, and fetal cardiomyocyte engraftment into normal and diseased myocardium has been demonstrated by simple injection methods.	3.096678534846209
Repeatedly, it has been shown that transplanted cells may survive for weeks within host myocardium and build intercellular connections such as grap junctions and desmosomes.	3.3014226554157404
In contrast, grafthost connections have not, as yet, been convincingly demonstrated.	2.901713907157494
Hypothetically, cell transplants might exhibit the following functional properties: stabilization of diseased tissue to prevent structural remodeling; carrier for recombinant proteins, growth factors or drugs to induce molecular alterations of host myocardium; and improvement of regional and global myocardial function due to active contractility.	2.9052364283974006
However, clear evidence of coordinated contractility of transplanted cells, and, thus, of a clinically relevant therapeutical use of cardiomyocyte transplantation as a replacement strategy for damaged host cardiac cells, remains to be demonstrated.	3.325007871279068
Concomitant with advances in medicine, involving the development and use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, organ / stem cell transplantation and pre-existing illnesses such as AIDS, the frequency of fungal infection has increased dramatically.	3.741803843346344
These factors determine the susceptibility of the lung for an acute or chronic course of disease.	3.724041686766757
Purpose: We evaluated the speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) at the os calcis as an indicator of osteoporosis and observed the age-related changes in ultrasound values in normal women.	3.45355560127505
Materials and methods: BUA and SOS were measured in 236 women using the "Achilles" densitometer (Lunar, Madison, Ohio).	2.6854295444338674
From the BUA and SOS values the BUA/SOS Index ("Stiffness" Index) is calculated.	2.779977357565331
We investigated 55 female patients with osteoporosis (aged 43-85 years) and 181 healthy women (aged 20-80 years).	3.3713819260799376
Results: Ultrasound values for women with osteoporosis were significantly lower than those for the normal control group.	3.603479385853036
The Z-score compared with young normals was higher for the BUA/SOS Index (-3.1) than for BUA (-2.5) and SOS (-3.0).	2.8233319263452263
At a BUA/SOS Index of 68 the sensitivity was 85 %, and the specificity was 77 % for patients with osteoporotic fractures.	3.73862808735153
We found a significant decline with age in SOS (r = -0.55), BUA (r = -0.50) and BUA/SOS Index (r = -0.57).	2.9262988833967962
Conclusion: Ultrasound bone densitometry at the os calcis can be used as a screening test in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	3.778466814099154
A treatment procedure requires the consent of the patient, but this is legally effective only if he is capable of giving his consent and can be informed accordingly.	3.521410800078321
Because of demographic development and the progress of medicine, the number of patients who are not able to give their consent is increasing.	4.443379202640586
In practice, we make do with the presumed consent of the patient or, for procedures that can wait, with the consent of legitimate family members.	3.3593207695893184
An initiative action is suggested by physicians and hospitals that should reduce this gray zone and the forensic risks drastically.	3.1341671334078254
A number of studies has shown a significant relationship between life events/life conditions and depression.	2.99182985176005
However, there is only a small number of studies investigating the effect of life events/life conditions in patients with severe depression from the endogenous subtype.	4.382389828350646
The present study examines the significance of the patients' life events/life conditions for the two year outcome of the illness in a prospective study with assessments every three months.	4.123414425434049
The results confirm the importance of life events and life conditions for the long term outcome of depressed patients with endogenous subtype respectively severe major depression in-patients.	3.9006839417504837
Relapsers show considerably more undesirable life conditions than non-relapsers three to six months prior to their relapse.	3.0224279867420707
Depressed patients indicate significantly more undesirable life events and life conditions and fewer desirable life conditions in comparison to the control group for the time span three months prior to their hospitalisation.	3.6096224631641425
Since the availability of protease inhibitors in 1997, there has been a great change in antiretroviral therapy but also new long term side effects have emerged, mainly metabolic changes such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterinemia and hyperglycemia.	3.1553539486678464
Besides, fat redistribution has been observed.	2.915222017233201
Fat wastes in the face and limbs but accumulates in the adipose tissue of the dorsocervical and abdominal region and the breasts.	3.3875802808604765
The mechanism of these changes remains unclear.	3.4488683873477446
For therapy a protease inhibitor free therapy or lipid lowering drugs may be tried.	2.844638130506071
29 of our 224 patients developed lipodystrophy.	3.246746969458745
27 of these patients had been treated with a protease inhibitor (17 patients with indinavir); 2 of the patients had never received protease inhibitors.	4.15543405594284
Background: The Low-Vision-Enhancement-System (LVESR) is the first binocular optoelectronic rehabilitation device with variable focus distance.	3.215463556107751
DNA-cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the WHO-classification.	4.471178889819121
In this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three recurrencies were investigated.	3.2987228239886486
In all cases the histological type and WHO-grade and the Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index were determined.	2.7637304112556826
DNA cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on Feulgen-stained preparations, and the following parameters were calculated: stemline ploidy, 5c-exceeding rate, and 2c-deviation index.	3.2912970761724862
There is a world-wide renaissance of neurosurgical treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD), based on substantial progress in basic sciences.	2.833210356435726
A model of parallel motor circuitry has identified potential targets for lesioning by clarifying the pathophysiological role of the basal ganglia in PD.	2.988429803537343
The internal globus pallidus (Gpi) is an essential player as it connects to thalamocortical projections and can be disinhibited by overactivity of the nucleus subthalamicus (Nst).	3.120299062597469
Lesioning of these targets has been successful in MPTP damaged primates.	3.160162724999902
There is clinical use of destructive as well as restorative and stimulative technics.	3.9631938287147133
Pallidotomy and thalamatomy have evolved by the use of better neuroradiological and electrophysiological targeting.	3.761171666559898
The first technic is used for treatment of rigidity, hypokinesia and dyskinesias, the latter one has proven to be efficient for tremor.	3.671510822788513
Dopaminergic reinnervation and increased dopaminergic output of the striatum has only been seen after transplantation of fetal cells; this method however carries immunological and ethical problems.	3.2296804659650657
The continuous high frequency stimulation of basal ganglia is the newest technic; it is highly adaptable to the patient's need and carries a low morbidity profile.	3.106033628996649
Thalamic stimulation is used for the treatment of tremor.	5.212426267735085
The stimulation of Nst and Gpi are proposed for dyskinesias and on/off phenomena.	2.780433489295274
Animal research further focuses on xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent precursor cells.	2.936909196580857
- In summary neurosurgical procedures seem to be verey promising; however longterm comparison studies are needed to define the best (combination) treatment(s) for the future.	3.5764643280799158
Concepts of documentation rely not only on the contents required and technical demands, but the procedures covered and in medical applications especially security aspects are also matters of critical concern.	3.4238095901067633
Even though the need for effective documentation (i.e., adequate in content, availability, feasibility and easy to retrieve analysis) is not a question, tasks and aims (for example, quality of patient care) deserve attention and establishing efforts have to be analyzed regarding their structural and personal prerequisites and implications before particular tools for documentation can be developed.	3.3367166969369477
The Medtronic Thera/Thera-i (and Kappa 400) pacemakers utilize a mode switching algorithm that switches from the DDD/R mode to the DDIR mode in the presence on an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	2.9233148653488255
To accomplish this, the pacemaker keeps track of a mean atrial rate (MAR) which is a weighted index of the atrial rate.	3.7571237766900594
Once the MAR is greater than the programmed mode switch rate the pacemaker mode switches to the nontracking mode.	3.0355222330271383
Because the algorithm weights faster atrial rates more heavily than slow atrial rates, the algorithm is sensitive to a wide variety of atrial tachyarrhythmias, including those with varying amplitudes.	3.371603256409261
Additionally, the algorithm provides a long PVARP and a rate adaptive (RA) AV interval.	3.064310805597753
These not only help ensure that a wide range of atrial rates will be detected, but may also limit the time the patient tracks at the upper rate before mode switching.	3.45160064408797
In order to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, the Thera-i provides detailed diagnostics which provide information on the date, time, duration, and rate of the mode switch episodes.	3.7322209624357696
Additionally, more detailed beat-to-beat information is provided for each episode which can help determine its appropriateness and can assist in making programming changes.	3.2016746610124205
There is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases.	3.8539258129219234
For dermatological patients such data are not available.	3.3515119096484507
In early spring 1998 we studied the psychological changes in 247 hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the Ruhr University Bochum.	3.2415984010351613
The prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological, cardiological or neurological patient populations.	3.1192826962915867
Surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or angiological diseases.	3.9250810075233726
These results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated.	3.0676497468580806
In an analysis of 3,838 restrained car drivers, the proportion of acceleration related injury of the cervical spine increased from under 10 % in 1985 to over 30 % in 1997.	3.5218929949503286
These injuries occurred mainly in the case of head-on or multiple collisions.	3.713881686979065
Letters were sent to 1,136 of the injured persons, and of the 138 patients who returned the questionnaires, 121 (88 %) were still suffering from their symptoms.	3.4554920174568804
The duration of the complaints was the longest after multiple collisions.	3.046687443916533
In order to resolve the difficulties of conducting of this retrospective study, prospective studies are necessary which include documentation of diagnosis, treatment protocols, duration and type of complaints.	3.569468069546226
Large B-cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non-Hodgkin-lymphomas (30-40%).	4.150080317153402
These lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma.	3.365162118727083
In addition to primary nodal, a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common.	3.0604539421272756
The neoplastic cells, even within one given case, show a broad morphological spectrum.	3.255390036860643
Several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large B-cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group.	3.839118045596531
There are two groups identified, that of the variants and that of the subtypes.	4.000737958367833
The various variants (centroblastic, immunoblastic, anaplastic, T-cell/histiocyte-rich) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical, immunophenotypical and genetic findings.	2.8610649094892553
In contrast, the primary mediastinal, the intravascular, the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities.	3.143528720998623
A number of recently described large cell lymphoma types, i. e. plasmablastic, ALK-positive and primary gastric, are included in the classification, their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion.	3.253743722566934
In the presented study, knee joint proprioception of 43 patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated.	4.067762706436018
In a control group, the proprioception of 30 healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestic inconspicous knee joints was examined.	3.524941710126193
We tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test.	3.2072465203116005
Additionally, all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage.	3.638039926813335
After applying an elastic knee bandage, the angle reproduction capability significantly improved to 9.2  °  +/-  4.5  °.	3.0201497734306857
Proprioception of the contralateral, noninvolved knee joint in the patients (11.6  °  +/-  6.3  °) was worse compared to the control group.	4.0447748592326995
Applying an elastic knee bandage did not significantly improve the proprioception of the uninjured knee joint.	3.2743287720233445
Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men.	3.9746254289642553
It is associated with a two-fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers.	3.8899691864724057
The relative inefficacy and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies.	3.0036103873185467
Ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two alternate strategies: ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	2.8021713302670985
It has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus.	3.2091093936371156
Most often, these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins.	3.658274454717542
A challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study.	2.8254595354594616
To sidestep the need of mapping, pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions.	3.396923413834825
In patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation, efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	2.810222887088925
Strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant wavelets requiring a critical myocardial mass to perpetuate.	3.487262540502132
Several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative compartmentalization of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation.	2.874466215406024
Though our knowledge of ablation techniques and technical prerequisites is continuously increasing, the difficulty to produce complete linear lesions in the left atrium and local thrombus formation at the ablation line are problems that are still not solved.	3.4698405832433066
Using a time-budget method in a 3 year longitudinal study with a control group design, substantial reductions in the engagement of non-obligatory instrumental, social, and leisure activities could be found in a group of mildly to moderately demented patients.	3.4364156860048443
Controlling these changes for differences in baseline paramters, the dementia-specific reduction was about 1,5 hours compared to a non-psychiatric control group.	3.7721865482068195
These clinically relevant changes in activity levels underscore the importance of these activity domains with regard to the development of diagnostically useful indicators at the early stages of dementia.	3.9172800904839526
Time-budget methods seem to be particularly useful to close the diagnostic gap with regard to the assessment of everyday competence indicators especially at early stages of the dementia illness.	3.81222178048986
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease with different etiological, morphological, functional, clinical and therapeutic aspects.	3.8376171991067096
Recent investigations indicate that HCM is considerably widespread in the population (1:500).	3.0226363946713284
The causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities (mutations).	2.8026520195832996
Depending on the clinical aspect, the complaints, and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results, we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management.	4.055741205873387
Atrial fibrillation is in 20-50% the most frequent dysrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and a possible cause for hemodynamical complications and prolongation off the medical treatment in patients.	3.9013093896545823
Therefore, the effect of -blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial.	3.6931206789091267
200 patients after CABG were randomized in a drug and control group (average age 63.2 years, 154 male, 46 female).	3.462836527917345
Patients of the drug group (n=100) were treated with metoprolol (1mg/kg/BW) beginning on day one after operation, whereas patients of the control group (n=100) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial fibrillaton.	4.034861882465765
ECG, blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations were measured regulary until the tenth day after surgery.	3.561995304017119
Reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction (< 30%, SA- and AV-block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol.	3.273115012065785
There were no significant differences between the patients of drug and control group with respect to age, sex ejection fraction, previous medication, number and type of bypass grafts, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and perioperative ischemic events.	3.5406190844914454
However, a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups, 4 patients of the therapy group (4%) in contrast to 37 patients of the control (37%) developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period (p<0.0001).	4.495459710258122
Both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by 1.5 days (control group: 9.83 +/- 2.88 days; drug group: 8.42 +/- 2.81 days), which was statistically significant (p<0.05).	3.345841431777112
All patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable sinusrhythm, whereas 7 patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation.	3.7276100480805727
The difference was statistically significant as well (p<0.01).	3.032442973182156
Neither typical side effects of metoprolol, nor AV-blocks, bradycardia (f<60/min) or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed.	3.3710087068035817
The conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol/day after coronary artery bypass surgery, which can reduce the incidence of SVA as well as the hospital stay statistically significant.	3.946377330680437
Especially by using the "Functional Muscular Diagnostics" described by Janda specific muscular imbalances can be found.	3.143835130089706
The method is easy to apply and should be used during and before the championship season.	4.095480214430997
Background: Angiotensin converting  enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) alter the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldesterone-system, which regulates the angiotensin II synthesis.	3.211751220224391
Angiotensine II is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor.	5.070780637758038
ACE-inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the WHO-guidelines.	4.850773223383739
The experiences concerning the use of ACE-inhibitors in pediatric patients are  limited.	3.9328109834873395
The frequency of side-effects are not known on a sufficient scientific basis.	3.5645506379364194
Evoked potentials (EP) are a valuable tool when assessment of neurocritical care patients is impaired by loss of consciousness and lack of co-operation.	3.741463618629296
Different modalities of short latency EP can be applied to evaluate sensory, auditory and visual systems.	3.3545788084357917
In this review we discuss EP studies in patients with thrombosis of basilar artery, space occupying cerebellar infarction and supratentorial mass lesions of different aetiology.	3.0197949320203303
Paclitaxel, a potent anti-tumor agent, shifts the cytoskeleton equilibrium towards assembly of altered and extraordinarily stable microtubules.	2.856098613082622
This makes paclitaxel a promising candidate for local drug delivery intended to address the proliferative and migratory processes involved in restenosis.	2.8480911656454584
In this article, results of our in vitro and in vivo studies with paclitaxel are presented.	3.0556741646455903
Cell culture experiments with monocultures of human arterial smooth muscle cells as well as cocultures with human endothelial cells showed that paclitaxel leads to an almost complete growth inhibition within a dose range of 1.0-10.0µmol/l, even after a short (20 min) single dose application.	3.61621493327469
The comparison of an active, semi-active, and passive delivery system (porous balloon, microporous balloon, and double balloon) favored the double balloon for the following in vivo experiments.	3.0924727171494473
Tubulin staining and electron microscopy enabled visualization of paclitaxel-induced vessel wall alterations.	3.2423804926033863
In the rabbit model, locally delivered paclitaxel resulted in reduced neointima formation and enlargement in vessel size; in the pig model, however, after stenting, this inhibition was not significant.	3.0404107506007505
Both reduced proliferation and enlargement in vessel size contribute to a preservation of vessel shape and are likely to be caused by a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton, which is also supported by vascular contraction force experiments.	3.6304343311712546
Atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases, with a still increasing incidence.	4.113077671441439
Although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood, a variety of triggering factors are known.	3.955425052214573
The following case report describes the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in a 2-year-old boy in whom both IgE-mediated allergic reactions and psychological factors were involved in triggering and maintenance of skin lesions.	3.4339114409775386
This demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be.	3.468240229411825
Identity development in adolescence may act as stressor triggering juvenile psychotic episodes.	3.0420845409431103
A model is being presented stating that self development in subjects with high vulnerability for psychosis leads to the establishment of an "imaginary self" consisting of phantasies and fictions without taking into account facts and social realities.	2.940101817005254
The "imaginary self" stabilizes irritating self deficiencies, thus leading to a vulnerability for depersonalisation and identity diffusion during actual turmoils of adaptation.	2.8947200674718974
Biomaterials are defined as non-living materials which are used in interaction with biological systems.	3.741504553133937
Especially in the field of urology, biomaterials are applied in urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and as cosmetic prostheses.	3.270229366167537
Biomaterial-tissue interaction is caused by the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial, its degradation, and the resulting protein denaturation.	4.603371848552343
General requirements include biocompatibility and functionality and the avoidance of carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic, and allergic reactions.	3.0281017833671062
Continuous modification of known materials, inauguration of new materials, as well as the possibilities of tissue engineering will determine their development in the years to come.	3.8256288430178578
Hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently.	4.580094014415243
In this paper, under the premise, that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right, the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method.	2.9673834712093714
It is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient.	3.127958096050728
First, a series of diagnostic, structural, motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed.	3.2045075325227343
Second, the moments of a capacity for cohesion and aspects of social relatedness are considered as helpful tools for a formulation of an indication.	3.0969093863429435
As cohesion - according to group treatment outcome research results - has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance, in the context of group psychotherapy, the quest for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions.	3.7143291109730114
The conclusion is that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, would preferably be indicated for those patients who suffer from constraints of emotional competence as stemming from developmental deficits.	3.0224269285129295
Purpose: To evaluate method- and user effects as well as the required time in the determination of left- and right ventricular ejection fractions in comparing manual and semiautomatic border detection of the endocardium.	3.636234253728147
The diagnosis of urinary tract infection in renal transplant patients is important because unrecognized bacterial infection may lead - in the worst case - to graft loss.	3.158306563610419
Between January 1995 and January 1997, we therefore obtained bladder catheter urine samples in 31 female allograft recipients when voided urine samples repeatedly showed pyuria (>=10 WC per microscope field (x40)) and significant bacteriuria (>=;105/ml) combined with vaginal contamination (plenty of squamous epithelial cells, mixed bacterial growth).	2.709307263757139
Results: In 55 % (17/31), diagnosis of urinary tract infection was confirmed by single bladder catheterization; in 26 % (8/31), urinary tract infection could be excluded, and in 19 % (6/31), bladder colonization without pyuria was found.	3.7604059634554594
Thus, 45 % of the patients with abnormal voided urine samples did not need antimicrobials.	3.984113139255405
After single dose antibiotic therapy with 500 mg Ciprofloxacin, given immediately after catheterization, no infectious complications occurred.	3.1046204137608298
Diagnostic single bladder catheterization is a simple, safe and - compared to suprapubic aspiration - barely invasive method for the diagnosis or exclusion of urinary tract infection in female renal transplant patients with higher risk for complications due to an acute bladder infection and non-conclusive voided urine samples.	3.7409863776824848
Type-2-Diabetes is a risk factor per se for such complications, but often clusters with dyslipoproteinemia, hypertension and obesity.	3.5806257002563484
This is referred to as "Metabolic Syndrome" and often operates on a genetically programmed susceptibility which accelerates the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in front of a much wider diabetes specific cardiopathy.	3.2911158223014225
In patients with the Metabolic Syndrome the coagulation system is switched towards a prethrombotic state, involving increased plasmatic coagulation, diminished fibrinolysis, decreased endothelial thromboresistance and predominantly platelet hyperreactivity ("diabetic thrombocytopathy").	2.711050915163008
Some of these factors are associated with an increased coronary risk (e.g.	3.094312221521131
fibrinogen, PAI-1, platelets), but are also directly linked to the pathogenesis of "atherothrombosis".	4.853822463745605
Altered cardiac remodelling together with adhesion and coagulation mechanisms appears suitable to explain decreased functional performance of infarcted organs, decreased success of acute (reduced fibrinolytic response, no reflow phenomenon) and longterm intervention strategies for vessel patency (PTCA, CABG) in Diabetes.	2.862760424860626
Glucose adjustment alone will not adequately neutralize these complex mechanisms, but in the situation of myocardial infarction eumetabolization with parenteral glucose-insulin-potassium infusion appears mandatory similar to non-diabetics.	3.4335115903772597
The indication for operative treatment in spondylolisthesis results from pain, progressive sliding and, in up to 60 % of the patients with progressive dislocation, from radicular malfunction.	3.8682928911439958
The posterolateral fusion in situ is a safe procedure, but the deformation remains and in spondyloptosis plastic deformation of the fusion mass can lead to further dislocation.	4.027662811936646
With the external fixator as an instrument for reduction and the internal fixator for stabilization the reduction of even serious spondyloptosis and the recovery of a normal spine alignement and posture is possible, with an acceptable neurological risk.	3.751354880853091
Therefore a concept of treatment is suggested, which as a rule is aiming at the anatomical reduction of the dislocated vertrebra beside stabilization and nerveroot decompression.	3.153781853794776
Depending on the extent of the slip, reduction and stabilization is to be performed in one, two or three stages.	4.062290915901338
In grade II-V a combined posterior and anterior surgical proceedure is recommended.	3.211655881736176
Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate a modified technique of interskalene brachial plexus anaesthesia (ISB) and postoperative catheter analgesia for shoulder surgery.	3.0161379705940905
The original method described by Winnie bears some rare but life-threatening complications (inadvertent subarachnoid or intra-arterial injection, pneumothorax).	2.9370313050637704
Objectives: Due to its low solubility and negligible metabolism, desflurane is assumed to be especially suitable for application by low-flow anaesthetic techniques.	3.170156689478264
The aim of this clinical investigation was the development of a standardised dosing scheme for low-flow and minimal-flow desflurane anaesthesia.	3.5380951870969954
Methods: One hundred six ASA status I-II patients were assigned to six groups according to the duration of the initial high-flow phase, fresh gas flow, and fresh-gas desflurane concentration.	3.4459833603393526
The median age, height, body weight, and constitution of the groups was comparable.	3.293841061363923
After an initial high-flow phase using 4.4 l/min, the fresh gas flow was reduced to 0.5 l/min (minimal-flow anaesthesia) or 1.0 l/min (low-flow anaesthesia).	3.3270192905544067
Inspired nitrous oxide concentrations were maintained at 60% to 70%.	3.19457156134548
Using different standardised schemes of vaporizer settings, inspired desflurane concentrations were applied in the range from 3.4% to 8.7%, i.e., between 1 and 1.5 MAC.	3.424894865766261
Inspired and expired desflurane concentrations were measured continuously by the side-stream technique and recorded on-line.	3.41995931719547
Venous blood samples were taken immediately prior to induction and 45 min after flow reduction for measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) concentration).	3.0737512737308137
Results: In the 10- to 15-min initial phase during which a high fresh gas flow of 4.4 l/min was used, the inspired desflurane concentration reached values in the range of 90%-95% of the fresh gas concentration.	3.5846463495837777
In low-flow anaesthesia this concentration could be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting, whereas in minimal-flow anaesthesia with flow reduction the fresh gas concentration had to be increased by 1% to 2%: The quotient calculated by division of the inspired desflurane concentration by its fresh gas concentration (Q=CI/CF) ranges between 0.65 and 0.75 in minimal-flow and between 0.80 and 0.85 in low-flow anaesthesia.	3.2709428210831333
Compared with its value prior to induction (2.13 +/- 1.05%), the COHb concentration decreased statistically significantly by about 0.7% during the 1st hour of minimal-flow anaesthesia (1.42 +/- 1.01%).	3.079439495192249
Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic properties of desflurane, resulting in especially low individual uptake, and the wide output range of the vaporizer facilitate the use of low-flow anaesthetic techniques in routine clinical practice.	3.890777512046205
Even in minimal-flow anaesthesia, the duration of the initial high-flow phase can be shortened to min.	2.893077200086151
If the flow is reduced to 1 l/min, the inspired desflurane concentration achieved in the initial high-flow phase can be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting.	3.0116203319064576
In minimal-flow anaesthesia, however, with flow reduction to 0.5 l/min, the fresh gas concentration has to be increased to a value 1%-2% higher than the inspired nominal value.	4.070334520065509
Due to the wide dialling range of the desflurane vaporizer, the amount of vapour delivered into the breathing system can be increased to about 110 ml/min even at a flow of 0.5 l/min.	3.56800867252598
The large amount of agent that can be delivered into the system even under low-flow conditions, together with the very low individual uptake, results in a time-constant that is sufficiently short for the clinically required rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentrations.	3.6829839516818668
The short time-constant of low-flow desflurane anaesthesia improves the control of the anaesthetic concentration.	4.122153697175419
If all measures are taken to safely avoid inadvertent drying out of the soda lime, there is no evidence that low-flow anaesthesia with desflurane is liable to increase the risk of accidental ca	3.951575706279103
Arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis.	3.8013064058654367
Specific complications are rarely documented in literature.	3.4639264736917594
The perforation of an arterial Port-a-cath followed by duodenal fistula is an uncommon complication of regional hepatic chemotherapy.	3.1728799721635186
Besides systemic disorders caused by the chemotherapeutic agents, such as vomiting, sickness, or gastritis and duodenitis, gastroduodenal ulcers can occur as a local complication of treatment.	3.5504668338839114
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery or occlusion of the port device are the most common reasons for withdrawal of treatment in our series.	3.8404276125141226
Based on our experience and the case report of a duodenal fistula we recommend angiography of the port system prior to each cycle of chemotherapy.	3.465467725382814
Background: Coenesthesias can be defined as disorders of body perception or body hallucinations, projected in different parts of the body.	3.055220854262132
These symptoms are reported even from organs where we usually have no perception.	3.052477752845475
Coenesthesia must be regarded as a symptom that can be observed in various psychiatric diseases, e.g., schizophrenia.	4.010540781400316
Therefore, accurate assessment of possible differential diagnoses is important.	3.4070267662989497
In late stages, coenesthesias can easily be recognized because of their "bizarre" character.	2.94122581084758
In early stages, however, patients often complain of intractable, unlocalizable burning pain.	3.413292952232338
They frequently undergo operations because of their great suffering.	3.54305578050979
The drug treatment of first choice is neuroleptics, but the results are unpredictable.	4.556918207473511
Question: What risks do different forms of immunosuppression (azathioprine, Cyclosporin, azathioprine/Cyclosporin plus steroids) represent in pregnancy for the mother and fetus after kidney transplantation?	3.2021201077221213
Retrospective analysis of 40 pregnancies and deliveries.	3.26087488662362
Investigation of abortion -, premature birth rate, fetal retardation, malformation, hospitalization, modus of labour, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal mortality, hypertonia, preeclampsia, anemia, kidney function, rejection crisis, mechanical compression, kidney function after 1 and 5 years postpartum.	2.955514740044142
Recommendation guideline: preconceptional time (contraception) and intensive care in pregnancy.	3.5563664723038677
Studies on the everyday life of the elderly often deal with visible behavior.	3.2132437070660846
In this study, the subjective experience of the everyday living environment was investigated, paying special consideration to the role of mobility impairment.	3.4668661779806884
Is the experience of living at home different for individuals with various levelsults were found in the experience of cognitive, biographical, and spatial dimensions of the living environment.	3.459300775880222
Similarities were found in the experience of emotional, social, and behavioral dimensions of one's home.	3.8862113874247384
Competence loss played an important role in how the subjects experienced living at home, yet even the mobility impaired experienced their home as a environment which could be shaped.	3.2152215586994766
The environment-oriented approach showed that the favorite place of mobility impaired persons was characterized by higher spatial density.	3.571294967680047
Finally, an examination of four home environment profiles using cluster analysis illustrated the connection between both person- and environment-oriented approaches and offered insights into a transactional perspective of person and environment.	2.858923033122648
Even though the subjective experience of one's home environment is not easily quantifiable in terms of maintaining everyday competence, it nonetheless imparts meaning to the elderly person's daily life.	2.9693239838088874
The main advantage of the bilateral medial rectus faden operation (posterior fixation suture) for the treatment of essential infantile esotropia is the low occurrence of delayed consecutive exotropia.	3.251875944849122
Nevertheless, this unwanted complication also occasionally occurs after a faden operation.	2.8897878632893885
We report the rare development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma involving the minor salivary glands in the buccal mucosa of a 78-year-old female.	2.9432930301187734
Tumor presented as a small asymptomatic left buccal mass.	3.3386920827948185
The initial dominant component of the neoplasm was a pleomorphic adenoma, while the minor component was a myoepithelial carcinoma.	3.659158346538561
Recurrences of tumor after 2 and then 5 years were excised.	3.64538722687564
Histopathological examination of the last tissue removed showed a pure myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands without evidence for a pleomorphic adenoma.	3.9015276057235346
The clinical features, therapy, diagnosis, histopathology and literature are reviewed.	3.2316456885232316
The purpose of this prospective study was to determine concomittant lesions of glenohumeral dislocation and their correlation with the outcome, to determine the influence of various stabilizing operation techniques on the outcome.	3.903835002209534
Preoperative arthroscopy was performed to document intraarticular lesions.	3.7193399303946473
There were 7 reluxations (5 because of a new accident), mostly after Putti-Platt procedures.	3.4562683723379237
The average modified Constant Score was 66 (10-85) points (maximum 85).	3.223553232100079
29 patients (27%) had less than 60 points, mostly because of pain and restriction of function, and were evaluated as poor.	3.8630781013045663
The severity of arthroscopically found lesions correlated with the outcome.	3.087374145255581
Operations with shortening of subscapularis tendon or using a bone graft gave bad results.	3.044018295872846
Anatomic reconstruction of the labrum-ligament complex in combination with a plasty of the extended capsule gave best results.	3.680243138239532
Preoperative arthroscopy can determine the extent of different lesions after shoulder luxation which influence the outcome and is useful to select the optimal operation technique.	3.578647807637482
Prenatal determination of fetal blood groups by DNA amplification today is possible for Rhesus D, eE, cC, Kell (K1/2), Duffy (Fya/b) and Kidd (Jka/b).	2.842393299081447
Current assays using multiplex PCR and at least two specific primers as well as an intern control offer a diagnostic power of more than 99%.	3.783338725652559
In all pregnancies complicated by irregular blood group antibodies, blood group typing in amniotic fluid allows to reduce the number of invasive procedures.	3.189040601800412
Adjuvant therapy with interferon for malignant melanoma causes neurotoxic side effects such as depression.	3.257323763996759
The biochemical mechanisms are unknown.	3.290640206419495
We report two cases with both depression and amnesia.	2.813540835886838
In one case, attempted suicide was a companied by 7 h of amnesia.	2.7279463458531414
The diagnostic classification and possible explanations for the amnesia secondary to interferon therapy are reviewed.	3.0080537896555177
Molecular and epidemiological studies have confirmed that human pathogenic papillomaviruses (HPV)types 16 and 18 are causally involved in the developement of carcinoma of the cervix.	3.303931756233419
This statement is also true, albeit with reservations as yet, of other so-called high-risk HPV types, such as HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56 and 58.	3.553802994849192
Around 500,000 women throughout the world become ill with carcinoma of the cervix every year, and 1-4% of all younger women have a precancer of the cervix uteri.	3.7771752575106
This knowledge of the viral origin of anogenital neoplasms has not yet been exploited for primary and secondary prevention of these illnesses, however.	3.9036385197025614
This is mainly because infection with genital HPV types is very prevalent in young women but seldom leads to carcinoma.	2.841577703966959
In this review, therefore, the most important epidemiological data available on cervical carcinoma and its preliminary stages are analysed with reference to an association with HPV.	3.736205732195221
In addition, the molecular biological data on HPV as it relates to anogenital carcinogenesis are presented.	2.694854009016378
In conclusion, the significance of HPV for the prevention of carcinoma of the cervix is discussed.	3.3198138017882504
We report the case of a 43-year-old woman who had a cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior myocardial infarction.	2.9798983105069516
Her husband and a general practitioner living in the neighborhood initially performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation.	3.3373500782208976
A prehospital emergency physician found ventricular fibrillation when he arrived after 20 minutes.	3.031798608573191
It was impossible to achieve stable rhythm by 42 attemps of defibrillation.	3.0175525532880108
Therefore, the patient was carried to our clinic under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.	3.5847310070309995
A cardiologist was informed with radio signal.	3.0979122470365006
Percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (pCPS) was implanted in the emergency department after 100 minutes of cardiac arrest.	3.7037497597926214
After stabilizing the hemodynamic situation by pCPS (4-5 l/min) it was possible to transfer the patient to the catheterization laboratory.	4.04375950710401
Angiography revealed proximal occlusion of a dominant right coronary artery.	3.1116624424428982
After successful angioplasty it was possible to reestablish stable sinus rhythm by single defibrillation.	3.177738892929828
By use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) the flow rate of pCPS was reduced every two hours.	3.0247889102582395
After 10 hours of support pCPS was explaned.	3.0902363852492365
IABP was needed for three days.	3.7502997895427583
The patient was discharged from hospital without any relevant neurological deficits after nine weeks.	2.8274527981184496
By using pCPS it is possible to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice.	3.3207260000071632
The use of pCPS in resuscitation is indicated in circulatory arrest if further therapeutic options seem promising.	3.0146929207196855
Defects of the frontoorbital complex subsequent to extensive tumor surgery or severe trauma often result in aesthetic and functional disharmonies.	2.955742676737594
The long-term results of rehabilitation related to different materials and techniques are the subject of this study.	4.048569157329193
From 1974 to 1996 altogether 127 patients with bony defects of the orbit and/or the skull base underwent surgery.	4.183201333045609
All patients' data were documented prospectively from 1984 onwards.	3.030269503001502
The results following reconstruction with autologous calvarian transplants in 52 patients were compared to those of a control group which received iliac bone or PMMA implants.	3.6145168524728377
Eighty-one bony defects (64%) resulted from tumor resection; 37 patients (29%) suffered from the effects of trauma.	3.5068991468796633
In 67 cases (53%) reconstruction was performed primarily, in 51 cases (40%) secondarily.	3.633420284368134
Free or pedicled soft-tissue transplants were necessary in order to separate the orbit and the neurocranium in 26% of the defects.	3.9357062444788102
On the other hand, small, isolated defects of the orbital roof (7%) were left without any reconstructive procedure.	3.185591048827205
Contrary to the iliac bone grafts, the calvarian transplants resisted secondary resorption.	3.2557874350306877
Postoperative infections appeared in two cases; loss of transplants was avoided entirely in the group of calvarian reconstructions in contrast to the alloplasts.	3.79390772646623
The selection of a suitable donor site area and rigid fixation with microplates led to excellent esthetic results even in cases with large defects.	3.3874452015867917
Within inpatient psychotherapy traditionally different therapeutic approaches are combined.	3.5495593029690253
Usually verbal interventions of different orientations and settings (e.g.	2.7541887972756056
individual and group therapy), nonverbal procedures (e.g.	3.084679587642844
music and art therapy) and bodyoriented techniques are included.	3.577966130023414
The combinations is merely additive, integrated or eclectic.	3.009985707119152
Little is known about the reciprocal interrelation of such combinations.	3.1293334550391934
Along the example of a definite additive combination of psychodynamic and behavioural psychotherapy for agoraphobias and obsessive disorders a rationale for the interrelationship of the different therapeutic components is discussed.	3.0281151279568155
We report an 18-year old woman with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and normal intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels.	3.395782702995533
The reason for this rare biochemical presentation are possible biologically active amino-terminal parathyroid hormone polypeptide fragments not detected by the widely used two-site immunoradiometric parathyroid hormone assay (PTH IRMA).	2.740025078450331
Diagnosis and therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism therefore should not exclusively rest on the finding of hypercalcemia coupled with an elevated iPTH level.	3.291084159344766
Viral hepatitis belongs to the most important infectious diseases worldwide.	3.502435686002292
More than 300 million chronic HBsAg carriers and chronic HCV carriers exist, respectively.	2.7340471031858575
Viral hepatitis is also very important in health care workers.	3.7462585245885327
Today viral hepatitis can be differentiated from type A to type E (G) based on immunological and molecular assays.	3.406157714149978
While enterally transmitted hepatitis type A and type E only induce acute and rare fulminant disease, hepatitis type B, C and D often induce chronic progressive disease including liver cirrhosis with typical complications due to the portal hypertension and with a high rate of association with the development of primary liver cancer (HCC).	3.87201499971062
This review focusses on viral hepatitis-related surgical problems, including liver transplantation.	2.8420976478922286
Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy (HDP) are one of the most frequent causes of maternal death and perinatal mortality.	3.2381766677418713
However, chronic hypertension without complications has a more favorable prognosis than preeclampsia.	3.250058569561001
Increased lipid oxidation, deported membrane components of syncytiotrophoblasts, and increased invasion of fetal cells in the maternal circulation triggering immunological reactions are discussed as the causes.	3.3550960292839056
The result is an endothelial imbalance between vasoconstrictory-aggregating and vasodilatatory-antiaggregating compounds.	2.587623465225612
The results of studies on the relevance of NO synthase are controversial.	3.153528813169019
Currently, neither reliable methods for the early detection nor certain preventative measures to avoid the disease are available.	3.5050488271808713
Intensive care monitoring and therapy are essential for pregnant women with severe HDP.	3.7453716325462367
The obstetric procedure depends on the severity and dynamics of the disease as well as the state of development of the baby.	5.0875873267339715
When the pregnancy is continued defined guidelines for its termination for maternal or fetal indications must be taken into consideration.	2.645428361134653
After delivery, the mother must be intensively monitored for at least 24 to 48 hours (postpartal eclampsia/HELLP syndrome).	2.939341531325299
The risk for recurrence of the preeclampsia is between 20 and 26 % or when it occurred in the second trimester up to 65 % while that of HELLP syndrome is between 3.5 and 24 %.	3.37807725020882
Acanthosis nigricans is a hyperkeratotic mucocutaneous eruption of heterogenous etiology which is characterized by hyperpigmentation, velvety cutaneous thickening, intensified skin markings and development of verrucous excrescences typically involving the intertriginous areas.	2.974598285498012
Malignant acanthosis nigricans is most often associated with an abdominal adenocarcinoma frequently unresectable at the time of diagnosis.	3.8030007283775333
We report on the rare association of acanthosis nigricans with a transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.	2.643144226261465
Symptomatic treatment with topical calcipotriol significantly reduced the hyperkeratotic and papillomatous skin changes.	3.050257869134603
The goal of this evaluation study is to analyze the effects of a new gerontopsychiatric institution, the gerontopsychiatric center (GC: a combination of a home-based outpatient service, a day-hospital and a consulting office for elderly with mental disorders) on the reorganization process of the treatment system from intramural toward extramural structures, as experts of the government of the FRG have been demanding for a long time.	3.584621859182898
Based on data of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies two regional catchment areas - the city of Bielefeld (without GC, control region) and the district of Gütersloh (with GC) - are compared and analyzed, whether changes within the gerontopsychiatric system (subsystem A), the system of general medical treatment (subsystem B), or within the elderly care system (subsystem C) occurred.	3.5833106151467162
Concerning subsystem A the results are that the GC has a strong impact on the intended shift from intra- to extramural structures, without selecting patients by diagnosis nor by severity degrees of their mental disorders in extramural treatment facilities.	3.0706207933259786
The home-based outpatient treatment is especially successful for elderly with a functional psychic disorder.	3.3918602239671043
These patients had the highest scores in improvement of psychiatric symptoms as well as in reduction of their self-care deficits within one year Effects of the GC on subsystem B were evident soon after its establishment, for example, by the increasing cooperation between the gerontopsychiatric health services and general hospitals in the region with GC, in which (hospitals) two fifths of all clinical gerontopsychiatric patients with a mental disorder as the main diagnosis (ICD-9) are treated.	3.937485651735267
An effect of the GC on subsystem C is possibly the fact that in its region the rate of direct transfers of patients from the clinical gerontopsychiatric department into homes for the elderly is significantly lower than in the region without GC.	4.123398764971312
One approach to verify these interactions can be seen in stress research.	3.502706820872081
While the phenomenon of stress-induced changes in immunological processes is widely accepted, more recent studies focus on possible moderators and mechanisms of these responses.	3.2342504573374726
Within this research strategy it became evident that catecholamine increases upon stress are of a major importance for the frequently observed mild leukocytosis.	3.2812497442299287
The present study was conducted to investigate whether the often observed stress-induced increases in the number of peripheral lymphocyte subsets depends on the amount of epinephrine or norepinephrine release.	3.906794301853801
Moreover, the question was addressed whether high or low catecholamine release is related to subjective ratings on discomfort.	2.872512982631755
Using a "public speaking paradigm" we were able to replicate previous findings of high increases in the absolute number of CD8+ and CD56+ cells in peripheral blood.	3.203581515418541
Moreover, when dividing subjects into high and low catecholamine responders, the amount of change was significantly larger in catecholamine responders irrespective of whether norepinephrine or epinephrine was used for grouping the subjects.	3.072182393627769
However, high and low catecholamine responders did not differ with respect to subjective ratings on discomfort.	3.294613370328772
The data are discussed with respect to underlying mechanisms in catecholamine-induced lymphocyte migration and possible reasons for the mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of stressor efficacy.	3.262342929648681
We report a locally recurrent retiform haemangioendothelioma (RHE) on the right great toe in a 40-year-old woman.	2.965294594066043
There was a secondary soft tissue lesion on her right lower leg.	3.027730384916059
Histologically, primary lesion, local recurrence and the secondary soft tissue lesion (soft tissue metastasis?)	3.424014367630735
Long, arborizing, neoplastic blood vessels were lined by CD31 and factor VIII-positive, monomorphic endothelial tumour cells; focally solid tumour areas, papillae and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature B and T lymphocytes were noted.	2.825838781826127
The concept and the group of low-grade malignant vascular neoplasms is discussed, with special emphasis on inclusion of RHE in this category.	3.813807160497907
HMSN is a hereditary symmetric ascending neuropathy of the peripherial nerves.	3.1976328855076637
Several cases of HMSN with motility disorders of both eyes have been reported in the literature.	2.957615913572404
We describe a patient with HMSN type 1 and an incomplete peripherial 3rd nerve palsy of the right eye.	3.4194621162854815
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of developed unilateral oculomotor disorder in a patient with HMSN.	2.601021282797794
A 34-year-old male (190 cm/100 kg) was scheduled for surgery of the nasal septum.	3.4988974317918284
He had had uneventful anaesthesia for appendicectomy 14 years earlier: following 600 mg thiopentone, 180 mg suxamethonium and up to 2 vol.% halothane for 20 min had been used and no symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (MH) were recorded.	2.880218505331505
Endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily [9], and the patient was ventilated manually in a semi-closed circle system until spontaneous ventilation resumed.	3.6388517226727792
Enflurane (1.5% for 5 min, 1.0% for 10 min, and 0.8% until the diagnosis of MH was suspected) was given in 33% O2/66% N2O.	3.807934427638286
Seventy minutes after induction it was noted that the spontaneous respiratory rate and minute volume had risen continuously from 10/min and 6 l/min, respectively, to 20/min and 12 l/min.	3.639628185030707
Attempts at deepening anaesthesia with repeated doses of fentanyl up to a total dose of 0.95 mg failed to reduce the hyperventilation.	3.5642156170293005
In spite of a high fresh gas flow of 6 l/min and assisted manual ventilation, the FIO2 started to fall from 0.34 to 0.28 at 10:20 a.m.	3.0700678182618852
The O2/N2O ratio was changed to 1 : 1, but the FIO2 remained at 0.3.	3.8409118285770614
MH was suspected, enflurane was discontinued, and an arterial blood gas analysis was done (Table 2).	3.835614232334521
When marked acidosis and hypercarbia were found, dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg was given, the operation was terminated, and the patient's trachea was extubated and he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for 24 h. Vital signs were stable (Table 3) and no further complications were observed.	3.71808438131158
The patient did not mention pain or uneasiness postoperatively.	2.7312986590805934
About 6 months later, a muscle biopsy was done according to the European MH Protocol [5] and the patient was found to be MHEh.	4.318698132838201
In this case five main reasons for the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis must be considered (Table 1).	2.9056571151881783
Firstly, hypoventilation does not seem to be reasonable as the patient was ventilated with 8 to 12 l/min, which is within the range of 80 - 120 mg/kg - min.	4.386679483447307
Secondly, we can exclude shock and hypoperfusion because the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate (within 65 - 90 beats/min), his fingertips and skin were well perfused, his body temperature was 37  °C, and there was no sign of muscle rigidity.	3.5559512718044948
Thirdly, a defect of the CO2 adsorber as well as CO2 admixture to the N2O and O2 ventilation gases can cause hypercarbia.	3.634730857490471
We use two absorbers in sequence of which one is changed every day, and found neither a change in colour of the indicator nor an abnormally raised temperature of the absorbers [11].	3.2044324842278655
A postoperative check of the ventilator showed no defect in the O2/N2O supply and a correctly functioning anaesthesia apparatus.	2.9452523748589075
A malfunction of both CO2 absorbers resulting in intraoperative hypercarbia could not explain a postoperative mixed acidosis lasting for more than 6 h. Anaesthesias performed at the same time using soda lime from the same canisters were totally uneventful.	3.5145770393860145
It is concluded that the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis were caused by hypermetabolism.	2.7426427264636875
A thorough postoperative examination by an internist did not reveal any thyroid, pulmonary, endocrine, or circulatory reason for our intra- and postoperative findings.	3.29853902944679
Iatrogenic factors like superficial anaesthesia or systemic side effects of adrenaline admixture to local anaesthetics can cause hypermetabolism without striking clinical signs, but they do not cause mixed acidosis lasting longer than 6 h (Table 2).	3.327734484512954
The most suitable explanation in this case is an abortive form of MH.	3.4131350821758244
Introduction: Avoidance of extracorporeal circulation during beating heart surgery (OP CAB = Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery) for aortocoronary bypass grafting (ACBG) is gaining increasing importance in modern cardiac surgery.	2.844612244324905
With the development of new mechanical stabilization devices, the revascularization of the posterior wall of the heart and the distal rith coronary artery became feasable.	3.4235615472951846
Especially high-risk patients with multiple risk factors for open heart surgery will profit from this approach, because the negative effects of the extracorporeal circulation are avoided.	4.365626569997176
A wide range of psychopathologically relevant symptoms have been described, but the common features of most cases include mental and motor slowing, apathy, emotional indifference, anosognosia, memory and attentional impairment.	3.243177669672035
A number of other functional deficits such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, acalculia, apraxia can also frequently be found.	2.689954571032181
Some emphasis is put on the work of J. de Mol (Brussels) which appears to be most important for the study of neuropsychological symptoms in NPH patients.	3.552014806930191
The methodological standard of a number of studies has been found to be rather low, and yet a sound neuropsychological investigation may be of utmost importance for the diagnosis and neurosurgical outcome assessment.	4.30616822690545
Concerning morphological correlates of the functional deficits in NPH, various hypotheses have been formulated, but it is argued that symptoms can neither be described as predominantly "diffuse" in nature, nor can they be reduced to unilocular dysfunctions.	3.316123713363479
Recommendations for future research strategies are formulated.	3.7531860325395834
Up to now there are no published results of therapy of paraphilia (Pedophilia, Sadism) and sexual aggressive impulsiveness with LHRH-(luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) Agonists in the Germanspeaking countries.	2.6687645953264854
In this report we describe 11 patients which were treated with the LHRH-Agonist Leuprolide Acetate in a period of 12 months.	3.404628702809947
The patients showed no tendency of sexuell aggressive behaviour and reported an evident reduction of penile erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexual deviant impulsiveness and phantasies.	2.642098695643867
One patient died from suicide.	3.249999913330245
In combination with other treatments LHRH-Agonist seem to be a very promising alternative to cyproterone acetate and its possible carcinogene effects.	3.4337458724288643
Aim of the study: To investigate the long-term effect of TNFR55-IgG1 in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis refractory to multiple previous DMARD treatments.	3.6065294420371474
Methods: Between 1994 and 1995 we recruited 80 patients for two double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials.	3.171404168942791
The dose range was 2.5-100mg/month given i.v.	2.7082569879400555
with cumulative doses from 40-940mg.	3.2346358735502427
All patients were followed-up prospectively for 24-36 months after initiation of therapy.	3.240949871099701
The evaluations included a 48 swollen and tender joint count, ESR, CRP, RF, ANA, ENA, and safety parameters at 6 month intervals.	2.6193026163156485
In addition, pharmacokinetics, TNF, and anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection.	3.259189751783554
Results: Data from 80 patients are available representing an experience of more than 170 patient years;  11 patients are still being treated.	3.5832002444597455
Predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol.	3.405110774265133
Six patients died  (1 during treatment, 5 in the post-treatment follow-up).	4.244138793914979
All deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post-surgery septic arthritis 6 months after the last dosing (during vacation in another country).	3.046296840350721
Anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half-time.	3.4010182820062345
Shifts in the TNFR55-IgG1 glycosylation pattern affected pharmacokinetics and efficacy.	3.140258863359357
A lupus nephritis occurred 18 months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive RA (ANA and dsDNS positive already before TNFR55-IgG1 initiation).	2.9836058281500173
Continued treatment for 3 years in 11 patients resulted in an 81% reduction in swollen joint count, less morning stiffness, less pain, and a reduction in steroids.	3.881663643837307
Conclusion: Treatment with TNFR55-IgG1 is safe and efficacious over the long-term in patients with severe refractory RA.	3.9512211741990466
For both VFR and as IFR flight, visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot.	3.3369373739327464
The new possibilities for change of refraction by means of corneal refractive surgery have led to an increasing demand from pilots for these new methods.	3.5401486878037756
Can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes?	3.906819390884711
The valid regulations for medical standards of pilots, as well as the future international regulations such as JAR and ICAO, are explained in this respect.	3.2594989593084405
A report is given on the work of the Advisory Board of the German Federal Government Air Traffic Authority and on the cases treated so far and their outcome, and recommendations are expressed.	3.699875050677099
Concerning the legal situation and clinical experience, advice for pilots, aviation medical examiners and ophthalmologists is given.	2.842111744548994
Persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders, especially hypospadias.	3.3997049246193893
Inadequate activity of the müllerian inhibiting factor, in addition to fetal testosterone deficiency, is responsible for this syndrome.	3.8727216690730644
The etiology, diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed.	3.1369129304212957
A complex case of penile-scrotal hypospadia, hypoplastic prostate gland, testicular ectopia and retrovesical cyst is presented.	2.6889384762840094
The official German guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called Robert-Koch-Institut, twelve years ago.	2.1679785781604934
The recently published official "guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	1.9451169442066158
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official German guidelines.	2.17624993614963
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia.	2.6591606830256467
At present, the importation into Germany of life-threatening and highly contagious diseases such as pneumonic plague and Ebola is unlikely, but cannot be ruled out.	2.8059495710406126
In spite of the extreme rarity of these diseases, guidelines are necessary to prevent the spread of these agents in case of their importation.	4.15165557628163
In Germany, marked regional differences exist with respect to the development of emergency regulations and the availability of specialized centers for diagnostics and therapy.	3.8385823002373156
A federal framework is missing.	3.2222907451870446
A concept is presented here in which the capacity to respond is substantially augmented with limited additional cost through inter-regional cooperation using existing infrastructure and federally standardized procedures.	2.986101163413096
The therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than 30 years.	3.569087161986616
A total of 83 patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as ingle-centre, long-term open (12 months) clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid ester preparations Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm.	3.606489991780519
The antipsoriatic effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear, with a mean reduction of 76% in PASI.	3.894272684556399
Adverse events in were noted in 62% of the patients (mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints).	3.8719011019078597
No severe adverse events occurred.	3.162805713993534
We believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy-resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long-term application.	4.1726785516088905
Background: Because retinal necrosis syndrome seldom occurs, we present our results of silicone oil tamponade for associated retinal detachment.	3.197632345865597
The eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions.	3.814105471924783
Swelling - often oedematous - is a frequent symptom.	3.8226098864253584
This publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short characterisations of possible causes.	3.4547641871079784
The subjective complaints of the patient charts (pain, pruritus) are shown to be important criteria for orientation.	4.46405167531238
Special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling.	2.9848918991128746
A 74-year-old man suffered from symptoms of a left upper lobe pneumonia.	3.4650764728301913
Additional retrosternal masses were proved.	3.3852886631873136
Progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy; infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen.	4.433624014881658
Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy showed no pathological findings.	3.303930300469954
His general health became worse, and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of "wandering pneumonia" with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism.	3.8200997115249336
Autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland.	3.0191985072478706
General manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow.	3.415590752503688
The difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms.	3.4633003997326814
Therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of CT, MR, and angiography is very important.	4.120571060113146
Definition of the problem: Is it the brain that makes a human being a person?	3.1968219860502236
This anthropological question has been raised because of the findings of modern human brain research, and there are severe ethical consequences anew: If the appropriate anthropological answer is yes, then all invasive research would be problematic, because one would touch the basis of human essence.	3.5069320195506823
The problem is that the two major philosophical paradigms that offer an answer to the anthropological question, dualism and monism, have opposing concepts.	2.935567827434123
Arguments: This paper argues that the error of these two paradigms is that they understand the human body and the human mind as 'res' - as things.	3.494411269680577
The explanation of the human being as an interactive unit of body and mind is impossible in both paradigms.	3.6058783297329637
A third anthropological view that tries to make that understandable is the anthropology of the Hebrew Bible.	2.6934370638013867
It does assume the category 'thing' while speaking about humans, it presumes the category 'aspect'.	2.7839482016606807
There is no Hebrew word for 'mind' in contrast to 'body' or vice versa.	2.732428490617684
The biblical language only knows terms for the unity of human beings seen under a certain aspect.	3.060526467655318
Conclusion: Here, the body and thus the brain are important and necessary condition for human essence, but this is not a sufficient explanation for the human personality.	3.93732252662441
Invasive research on the human brain is here neither generally forbidden nor tolerated - one has to demonstrate in every single case whether the planned operation touches regions that are crucial for the personality of the human subject.	3.4133610341800034
Introduction: In recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement: hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation.	3.084817884389686
While the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell counting, the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately.	3.46309233057803
In the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation.	2.9722261647829136
A 50 year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical infraclavicular blockade of the plexus brachialis (VIP).	3.2980259678857147
Postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia, which resolved completely after treatment.	3.0111854772396103
The blockade of the plexus was performed correctly, failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded.	3.168797059972623
Therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the VIP, which might occur despite correct technique, and requires that the patient be informed of this eventuality.	3.694531171942881
Nevertheless, the VIP is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet.	3.5370987118466584
The risk of a pneumothorax is about 0.2 to 0.7%.	3.4186998339032644
The routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine.	3.510722180667845
New trends in perinatal medicine, aiming at more individual and self-determined pregnancy and delivery, are realizable because of the safety provided by ultrasound.	3.417715071369486
Often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations, but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy: early detection of fetal viability; intrauterine localization of the pregnancy; exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy; later in pregnancy, confirmation of appropriate fetal growth, position and localization of placenta site.	3.29397111919317
In addition, the development of close mother-child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact.	3.2016389568976127
These aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child.	3.402326383201266
For routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children, sonography, voiding cystogram, IV pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available.	3.2743216596867404
Furthermore, often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed.	2.968790692841808
Therefore, we reviewed the records of 41 children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department.	3.1754982412914923
In 9 children the ureter was visualized by IV pyelogram, voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography; a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in 21 children before pyeloplasty in the OR.	3.3584660946720097
In 11 children the ureter was not visualized preoperatively.	2.753319497354732
Retrograde ureterography neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique.	3.4868380416731886
In the children where the ureter was not visualized preoperatively, no ureteric abnormality was found in association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction.	3.2516733097804376
Hence, we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary, provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation.	3.532017295757243
We report on a patient with multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma, whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis.	2.798450388020175
Spontaneous remission of the tumour, which has now been maintained for over 2 years, the change from the primary monomorphological fibrocytic appearance to a polymorphological histiocytic picture with multiple fat-storing giant cells, and the lacking demonstration of specific cell organelles finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed.	3.931156348064858
Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue.	2.9477893675002353
We report about a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms' tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications.	3.0325714240027084
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross-section imagings.	3.2575572409596134
Both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms'tumor.	3.8215398874468347
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technic based on the idea of biological tissue healing.	4.2437016254352615
External gene segments are transferred to cells that overexpress growth factors locally to achieve this effect.	3.0924205635622464
The influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature.	3.1888080571202697
Gene transfer is a promising, new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade.	3.584713826196692
Biomechanical investigations of the mandible are difficult to perform due to a variety of conditions involved.	4.927046265527105
For the appropriate reconstruction of biomechanical properties, a geometrically correct body model has to be established which fits to complex in vivo conditions.	3.3556292973786896
The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of finite-element models (FEM) for the assessment of mandibular deformation under mechanical loading.	3.002733754397011
Explanted human mandibles (n = 5) were investigated by strain gauges to determine the individual strain distribution under mechanical loading.	3.7520187750730636
Our study demonstrates only minor interindividual differences in the strain distribution for each load studied.	3.180533592079588
The mechanical response in terms of deformation was found to depend mainly on gross geometrical properties and to a minor extent on the various other variables.	3.7939428694490824
At all positions the maximum principal strain was tensile, the minimum principal strain was compressive, and the absolute strain values were correlated with the magnitude of the applied force.	3.646168962803532
CT-based FEM analysis revealed the utility of mathematical models to approximate simulated data our experimental results.	2.9348885669760687
Hence, FEM analysis is a non-invasive tool in the prediction of biomechanical behaviour of individual mandibles and therefore may help in trauma reconstruction and treatment planning.	3.7503443226999815
Acrodysostosis is a rare syndrome characterized by growth retardation and peripheral dysostosis.	4.014207995083049
70% of affected patients exhibit mental retardation.	3.7759531294915267
Inheritance occurs in an autosomal-dominant pattern.	3.8351692832862105
The genetic defect is not known.	3.6797555458468523
Therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are based on the high number of non-resectable cancers, the high relative radioresistance and the high distant metastases rate.	4.6277841091337
Even in curatively resected carcinomas, a locally effective treatment modality is needed because of the risk of microscopical residual disease in the peripancreatic tissue.	3.410469527470193
The efficacy of radiotherapy is dose dependent.	3.084483517776994
Based on an analysis of published data a dose of more than 50 Gy is recommended, resulting in a high morbidity rate with external beam radiotherapy alone.	4.380911221677265
The use of intraoperative radiotherapy allows locally restricted dose escalation without increased perioperative morbidity.	2.907888456235983
In adjuvant and in primary treatment, local tumor contol was improved (70-90 %).	3.3456369470588885
With palliative intent, pain relief was obtained rapidly in over 60 % of patients and led to improved patient performance.	3.8530386846492526
As a result of the high distant metastases rate, even in curatively resected carcinomas, the overall prognosis could not be significantly improved.	3.6759385648213834
Further dose escalation is limited by the increasing incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (20-30 %).	3.856043648200935
Malignant tumors of the head and neck region are amongst the six most often occurring tumors of the body.	3.7256438590799084
They can be associated with the different anatomical compartments as well as different histologic types.	4.592375892951492
The way of tumor spread of these malignancies depends on their histologic type and on the region.	3.792081885673563
These compartments can be separated into the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the hypopharynx.	3.938691560839133
Most of the malignant tumors belong to the squamous cell carcinomas, other histologic types are depicted less frequently.	3.299233126926535
The histologic types of the other groups which are seen more often comprise of lymphomas and adenoidcystic carcinomas.	3.328914855973893
The undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx is supposed to be a special type of tumor.	4.607713743049119
The malignant tumors of the pharynx can also involve all three compartments.	3.7450891845371825
Beside these tumors, malignancies of mesenchymal origin can also be delineated.	3.668014186443454
While there are quite a number of reports on vascular injuries complicating hip arthropasty by acetabular component screw fixation, retractor tip pressure or extruding bone cement, the incidence of deep femoral vessel injuries in operative fixation of proximal femoral fractures is comparatively seldom described.	3.112051867339963
We report on two patients with per- and subtrochanteric femoral fractures who sustained injuries of deep femoral artery branches during the implantation of a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and a dynamic condylar screw (DCS), which resulted in a massive thigh hematoma and a fist-size pseudoaneurysm respectively and necessitated surgical intervention in either case.	3.2966391511335273
We blame these vascular injuries on the pressure of Hohmann retractors exposing the femoral bone or on the drilling of boreholes for plate attachement.	2.9088975577567426
After discussing various operative procedures, we conclude that intramedullar implants are safer than plates with regard to potential vascular complications.	3.434196946147951
Cleft lip and palates (CLP) are caused by a variety of factors.	3.868851762008404
Ionizing radiation is only one of these factors.	4.406781925121545
The meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, and the subsequent radioactive fallout did not cause any acute radiation sickness in Germany.	3.385212580787076
Nevertheless, in West Berlin a significant increase of trisomy-21 cases was reported in births 9 months after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	3.2448893772006713
In our study we analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of CLP newborns in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR).	3.122614633180163
In contrast to the Federal Republic of Germany an ongoing malformation register for CLP newborns had existed in the former GDR since 4 July 1967.	2.6416647073139314
Environmental data were collected from national and international environmental authorities and atomic energy agencies.	3.4882207637111824
Population statistics were taken from the statistical yearbook of the former GDR.	3.322120565131575
During a 10-year period from 1980 to 1989, the average number of CLP newborns in the GDR was 1.88 per 1,000 live births.	3.4778108374110146
A significant prevalence increase was recorded in 1983, 1987 und 1988.	3.0673463592463874
In comparison to the mean rate in the period from 1980 until 1986, 1987 demonstrated an increase of 9.4%.	3.693505325440151
Regional prevalence increases were seen in the three northern districts of Schwerin, Rostock and Neubrandenburg, where the radioactivity measurements in general showed higher levels of the radionuclides caesium-137 und strontium-90 than in other districts.	3.239819133481149
Owing to the comprehensive malformation register for CLP patients in the GDR, this is the first study for Germany, analyzing the CLP rate before and after the fallout in Chernobyl.	3.3801534809698395
The results support the allegation of the influence of radiation-induced increase of CLP newborns after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	3.1778110677086233
The aim of the present investigation was to identify patients with prolonged survival in stage IV disease and to analyse the possible impact of therapy on the course of the disease.	3.2678387991867224
in the Department of Dermatology, Benjamin Franklin University Medical Centre at the Free University of Berlin, 263 patients with were diagnosed as having stage IV melanoma and enrolled in a computer-based registry between 1970 and 1993.	2.8326967676351402
There were 48 patients who received both systemic and local therapy.	3.6201352452203555
On the other hand, 111 patients received no treatment.	2.612421120608252
Twenty two patients were identified survived longer than 24 months (median survival time 33 months).	3.9292638668702384
None of the patients who had received no treatment survived for 2 years or longer.	4.090641335702169
The 22 patients with prolonged survival were treated by multimodality included 16 who had received both systemic treatment and surgery and/or radiation, while 3 had had only systemic drug therapy and another 3, only local treatment.	3.8019358769773492
Twelve of the 22 patients became tumour free after their initial surgery or radiation.	3.1540381142364655
Active therapy in disseminated melanoma with reduction of tumour mass by surgery and radiation and with systemic medical treatment may lead to prolonged survival in a considerable percentage of patients.	3.680543088332392
Background: The use of intravenous heparin is essential for the treatment of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction.	4.351501235203347
A significant rebound of thrombin generation within 6 to 10 hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported.	3.1406453645943597
It has therefore been recommended to gradually taper heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly.	2.9319379545492184
However, it is not known which dosing procedure is useful and whether it definitly reduces thrombin rebound.	3.5305621201043267
The use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human integument is discussed with reference to the literature.	3.4134545987477574
The epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural, functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers.	3.450602521814157
The actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed.	2.876311414262549
Practical difficulties are emphasized: in particular, the conditions required for use of porcine skin in experimental research, the most suitable breeds, and restrictions on biological interpretation of the results.	3.5959087871500963
Laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortal lymphadenectomies are therefore performed to assess the operability of carcinoma of the cervix and for its staging.	3.4275975404900234
If laparoscopy discloses positive lymph nodes, debulking can be carried out and the patient can be referred for radiotherapy.	3.8434740031434207
In addition, laparoscopic procedures, even in combination with radical cervicectomy for early invasive carcinoma of the cervix, can mean conservation of the patient's fertility.	3.750494880203734
In the case of primarily inoperable tumours laparoscopy can be used to assess the lymph node status and the intra-abdominal tumour spread and to classify the patient's condition as potentially secondarily operable or inoperable.	3.6703995838829266
In addition, in the case of primarily undertreated patients whose carcinoma of the cervix has been diagnosed incidentally in preparations of tissue examined following hysterectomy, posttreatment in the form of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopically assisted colpectomy can be performed.	3.0799752868156274
The efficacy of buprenorphine in opioid dependent patients (n=20) was compared to methadone maintained subjects (n=20) in a randomized comparison trial.	3.8754806815064167
A trend (p=0.06) could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of 63 mg oral applicable methadone (racemat of L- and D-methadone) in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7,3 mg buprenorphine (sublingual tablets).	3.2022970163955455
The dropout-rate of 11 subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout-rate of 5 in the methadone group.	3.7554342542275707
There was no significant difference between the two groups over the treatment period in respect to additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine as evaluated through urine toxicology.	2.595380428857053
The result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid (p=0,04).	3.567253298819031
Nevertheless, efficacy of buprenorphine in maintenance could be demonstrated in the remaining subjects, and further studies with higher daily doses and a higher number of subjects have to be performed.	3.8583485286177
In patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, surgery is a technically difficult procedure.	3.116295288008616
Whereas those rare forms of localized pleural mesotheliomy are being detected incidentally and can be cured by complete resection, most patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma present with an advanced stage of disease.	3.4576444785929374
Most of these patients survive less than 12 months irrespective of the treatment modality.	4.021316793307458
For diffuse pleural mesothelioma, some favorable prognostic factors were identified: IMIG (International Mesothelioma Interest Group), stages I and II, epithelial type, age under 50, female gender.	3.093652798690073
In IMIG stages I and II, extended pleuropneumonectomy followed by chemo- and/or radiotherapy is recommended.	3.637642528209765
For this subset of patients, a median survival time of between 20 and 30 months is reported.	3.895932557014967
Pleurectomy and decortication are recommended as palliative surgical strategies against pleural effusion.	3.2695853968291595
In patients with technically inoperable infiltration of the thoracic wall, irradiation is helpful; sometimes partial remission and relief of pain can be achieved by chemotherapy.	3.28869130733503
Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) registers the magnetic field generated by the fetal heart.	3.030756402911285
In contrast to the fetal elctrocardiogram, fECG permits non-invasive registration of fetal heart activity and documentation of all parts of the PQRST-wave-forms from the second trimenon onwards.	3.1857813861836255
We examined 53 women in 104 recordings from the 10th week of gestation onwards (1 to 10 recordings per individual).	2.8620354508841586
The fMCG (37 magnetic channels, sampling rate 1024 Hz, bandwidth 1-200Hz) was recorded non-invasively over the mother's abdomen in a magnetically shielded room.	2.7556833593960417
Registration of fetal heart beats was generally successful from the 20/21th week of gestation onwards.	3.36339427228906
In a few cases, fetal heart beats could be registered as early as in the 16th week.	3.460594280021046
Cardiac time intervals and amplitudes of fMCG increased concordantly with fetal growth.	2.906188744539162
Mean P wave duration increased from 31 to 49 ms (p < 0.05), PQ interval from 95 to 107 ms (n. s.) and QRS duration from 36 to 52 ms (p < 0.01).	2.9313719603540926
The mean amplitudes of the P and R waves also increased.	3.0199252077122334
To demonstrate imaging findings in inflammatory diseases of the pharynx and possible complications.	3.9684336520937316
The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint.	3.224511746702884
In all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in 111 patients (79,3%) we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results.	3.5689391670944017
All in all we have found complications in 14 patients.	3.3060539738001835
In 4 cases we have seen a delayed wound healing, in 2 cases a superficial infection, in 3 cases a deep infection, in 3 cases a neural damage and in 2 cases a phlebothrombosis.	3.391410050212566
Our study show, that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy, exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the portals.	3.829258208611343
The use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate.	3.5907108076066945
Airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise.	3.9437609648327685
This very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 dB sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries.	2.9555797230047505
We report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation.	2.7712217347099806
The 24-year-old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000- to 6000-Hz range and in the deep-frequency.	3.5789434319573656
The possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic.	3.111144132485225
The incidence of primary malignant neoplasms of the pleura, the pericardium and the peritoneum in Germany has been rising since about the mid-1980 s. A continuing rise is expected until about 2020, predominantly due to the peak of asbestos processing in Germany between 1965 and 1980.	3.0586975683947513
About 90 % of the mesotheliomas stored in the files of the German Mesothelioma Registry in Bochum are asbestos related and therefore possibly due to occupational exposure that may be compensated by the professional associations.	3.3665654745036395
More than 500 mesotheliomas annually can be diagnosed in the German Mesothelioma Registry.	3.8250258163260207
In this first part of the series on mesotheliomas, current concepts on etiology and pathogenesis as well as diagnostic procedures and standards are discussed.	4.12521786051969
At the present, specific chromosomal or genetic defects that constantly give rise to a mesothelioma are not known.	3.1484450988787236
The initiation and progression of malignant mesotheliomas is a highly complex mechanism that is based on individual genetic alterations.	3.6226380512712884
A reliable diagnosis is the basis for therapeutic, prognostic and medicolegal conseques; in general, it can be achieved by thoracoscopic inspection with selected biopsy.	3.8370124635420084
Surgery may gain a more important role in the therapy of malignant tumors of serosal membranes not only in palliative, but also in potential curative approaches if the diagnosis can be made at earlier tumor stages.	4.0879738726676615
Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10%.	4.593758705857701
The medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source.	4.0911899583083216
Prognosis and mortality are dependent on intensity of bleeding, reflected by clinical signs such as shock, hemoglobin level, transfused blood units, hematemesis, presence of comorbidity and age of the patient.	3.2929878828467847
Furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality.	3.731996619438222
Therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding.	4.081875587441125
Joints are innervated by nociceptive nerve fibres (nociceptors), which are only activated by tissue-damaging stimuli.	3.5226873702619463
This activation causes pain in conscious humans.	3.1461237953587298
The sensory terminals of many nociceptors in the tissue are sensitized by inflammatory processes.	3.1787956440302185
Under these conditions, normally innocuous and non-painful stimuli are sufficient to activate nociceptors and to elicit pain.	3.0444299553987118
The effect of inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and prostaglandins is important for the process of sensitization.	3.352597847893172
In addition to their sensory function, many nociceptors have an efferent function.	3.0390135707790686
They evoke a neurogenic inflammation by the release of neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide into the tissue.	2.945464294211407
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone (AAA bone) is prepared from cortical bones of human organ donors.	2.606635240873343
AAA bone possesses osteoinductive properties as it delivers BMPs from its bone matrix.	3.0482015271644656
Within a prospective study, 37 cranial defects were reconstructed using AAA bone implants over a period of more than 7 years.	3.7720472682833526
The patients were followed-up at standardized intervals.	3.0866125274483815
Roentgenographic assessments and bone scintigraphies revealed osseous integration and remodelling of the AAA bone implants.	3.1845597646613446
In one quarter of the cases re-entry was performed 10 to 18 months after the cranioplasty (removal of osteosynthesis material, recurrence of tumor).	3.5338345765222385
All nine AAA bone reconstructions showed bleeding surfaces and bony integrations.	2.957609405192078
A bone biopsy was taken from the center of one of these AAA bone implants and this showed new bone formation originating from the surface of the implant.	3.9204659849164614
In one case an AAA bone implant was lost due to infection.	2.710783403589729
This is noteworthy as in approximately one third of the cases the bone implants were in direct contact with the frontal sinus.	3.8705401465827634
The clinical results clearly emphasize the therapeutical benefit of AAA bone for cranioplasties.	2.81593524674488
Large AAA bone chips from human skull bones facilitate the reconstruction of the skull's convexity, especially when sterolithography-based operation planning is performed.	3.0807791523281702
Saphenous vein harvesting remains a 20 % source of morbidity in patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting.	3.3911414878469
In an attempt to reduce the complications associated with this procedure, minimally invasive video-assisted vein harvesting is propagated.	3.946230874883467
The technique uses currently available endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the great saphenous vein with two limited incisions.	2.823777013477226
The dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches by clips.	2.9009893035140615
The vein is removed for reverse arterial bypass grafting or dissection is completed for an in situ bypass procedure.	3.3676502608244268
Initial experience with ten patients undergoing peripheral bypass procedures showed a mean vein-preparation time of 60 min.	3.112411457283537
Two of seven in situ bypass procedures were complicated by side branch damage controlled through longer skin incision.	2.9141155380324246
After a mean follow-up of 12 months, all bypasses are patent.	3.672014723508555
Taking our own experience as well as that reported in the literature into consideration, aspects of cost-effectiveness are discussed.	4.4289095458268095
Obstructions of the nasolacrimal duct occur frequently (70%) in term newborns and are symptomatic in 6%.	3.2542371521662385
The reason is an incomplete canalization and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period.	3.5798077004833444
A persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of Hasner in combination with a proximal valvelike obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation.	3.269957877968136
We describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress.	2.9759492049590186
The recognition of a medical discipline on a European level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the European Union.	3.4354758540520502
With supreme effort, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the EU reached this goal in 1989.	3.3448404487710284
The UEMS - Section of Stomatology and Oromaxillofacial Surgery - became the forum for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and officials of the European Commission.	2.956313794770515
A biatrial pacemaker was inserted in a 68-year-old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs based on a sick-sinus-syndrome and concomitant interatrial conduction delay.	3.2890675436097454
One electrode positioned in the right atrium and another electrode located in the coronary sinus were connected to a dual-chamber pacemaker.	3.435188167211036
The electrode in the right atrium was connected to the atrial channel, the electrode in the coronary sinus to the ventricular channel.	3.7710342479192
The pacemaker was programmed in DDD-mode with an AV-delay of 30 ms.	3.3535482160082806
Under a chronic antiarrhythmic medication with 160 mg sotalol per day there was no evidence for recurrent episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias in the patient's history, 24-h-Holter-ECG, nor in the memory of the pacemaker during a follow-up of 8 months.	3.7998668564020477
The AB0 blood types, first discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped with the PCR method of Lee and Chang [6].	2.842634221312714
Using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after digestion with restriction endonucleases, visualized by silver staining on a polyacrylamide gel.	2.686315773573413
In a southwest German population the allele frequencies were: Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556.	2.574654866315442
With the method of Lee and Chang [6] only the nucleotide positions 261 and 703 are considered so that out of 280 individuals 10 (3.57%) showed differences between the AB0 genotype and phenotype, because it was not possible to differentiate between A and 02 alleles.	3.0696661614722327
Based on the one experience and the information that is available in the literature indications for ankle arthroscopy are given, surgical equipment, patient placement and surgical technique of different procedures are described.	3.7827978612131865
Finally the results and possible complications are presented.	4.006107486265401
Removal of loose bodies as well as synovectomies in case of an acute infection or rheumatoid arthritis are good indication.	4.1012448702622875
Arthroscopic treatment of anterior pathology in the athletic ankle need a thorough diagnostic work-up; the results of the treatment do not always meet the expectations of this especially demanding population.	3.675288641073452
Cartilage treatment is technically possible, however, long term results are still missing.	4.613293678613144
This is also true for the treatment on osteochondritis dissecans.	4.196206768934801
In patients with degenerative joint disease arthroscopic debridement can only lead to a temporary benefit.	3.3646999494854586
Arthroscopic assisted arthrodeses (AAA) is technically demanding, but can serve as an excellent alternative to conventional open techniques.	3.688914667635985
The complication rate in ankle arthroscopy is high compared to other joints, which is especially true for neurologic complications and postoperative infections.	3.6043630174091366
This should be addressed when performing the informed consent.	2.8329096869345047
Recent prospective randomised trials dealed with the optimal extent of surgical resection as well as with preoperative therapy modalities in pancreatic, rectal and breast cancer.	3.3905958245148256
In pancreatic cancer extended lymphadenectomy did not improve overall survival.	3.303655613260027
Total mesorectal excision remarkably changed surgery for rectal cancer.	3.069169204333748
Rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer could be significantly reduced by preoperative irradiation.	3.7392982151479353
In advanced rectal cancers curative resection and sphincter preservation seems possible due to multimodal preoperative therapy.	2.7838425324648397
It has been demonstrated that in appropriate cases breastpreserving resection is comparable to mastectomy with respect to overall survival.	3.4594625683964484
Up to now it is not quite clear if sentinel node sampling is equivalent to routine lymphadenectomy.	2.858475132349156
Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy breastpreservation rate is significantly higher, but survival is not significantly increased.	3.5567517214809645
Introduction and Methods: A 0.5 T open-configuration MR system allows free access to the patient via a 58-cm-wide opening on both sides of the machine.	3.4262538035672616
For imaging, a 2D gradient echo sequence is used (TR 19 ms, TE 9 ms, flip angle 30  °, FOV 24 x 24 cm, slice thickness 10 mm matrix 256 x 128).	2.736172559485429
The acquired images are displayed on two LCD screens localized within the MR system, thus allowing an interactive needle guidance.	3.0894002493194677
This procedure is illustrated by a case report.	3.323373086291434
The rational for the use of ACE inhibitors is to block the vasoconstrictive effects mediated by angiotensin II.	3.303414806350631
The hemodynamic profile of ACE inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the degredation of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide (NO).	2.6864062637351993
Since vasoconstriction, particularly of the mesenteric vasculature appears to be largely mediated by the renin-angiotensin-axis, ACE inhibitors are assumed to be effective in treating or avoiding gut mucosal hypoperfusion.	3.190571538231968
The critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is still a major therapeutic challenge.	3.364827895276133
However, several questions about the exact mechanisms of ACE inhibitors, such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose, are still open.	3.959786876211265
Moreover, further work needs to be done to definitely determine whether ACE inhibitors may be helpful to prevent or treat (micro-) circulatory catastrophe in these patients.	3.1517131242409135
The pharmacologic properties of ACE inhibitors provide an exciting stepping stone for future research in this field.	3.1977032718623706
Hypoparathyroidism (HP) results from deficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, pseudohypoparathyreoidism (PHP) results form decreased PTH action on its target organs.	2.727817809768693
The operative spinal interventions followed the classic sequence of excision of part of a vertebral body, partial replacement of the vertebral body with bone harvested from the iliac crest, and implantation of a titanium plate to stabilize the part to be fused.	3.503895548268589
In 62% of these cases we performed primary dorsal straightening with a fixateur interne.	3.506153034778537
The serious complications were aortic leakage and deep infection in the area of the graft and the implant, each of which occurred in 1 case.	4.00815186426161
Comparisons with the literature showed approximately the same rate of spinal complications as with open surgery, while the rate of morbidity connected with the surgical approach was reduced to a third in the patient population treated endoscopically, with correspondingly positive implications for the postoperative analgesic requirement and for convalescence.	4.119739309846215
Various risk scores have been developed for the assessment of operative risk in cardiac surgery.	4.398743384852902
Although risk stratification has been acknowledged as a useful tool to analyze trends in therapy and changes in patient populations, its relevance in assessing the indication for surgery has been questioned.	3.828738552856223
It was the goal of this prospective study to compare 6 common risk scores with regard to the predictive value for mortality in individual patients.	3.4205967316294648
Between September 1998 and February 1999 all adult patients undergoing heart surgery were prospectively scored according to the following scores: initial Parsonnet, Cleveland Clinic, French, Euro, Pons, and the Ontario Province Risk score.	3.2923044607549032
Early lethality was assessed within 30 days postoperatively.	3.2699764236062445
Follow-up was completed in 504 patients.	2.9545886845692393
With the exception of the Ontario Province Risk score, lethality in the high risk group was overestimated by all scores, whereas lethality in low to moderate risk groups was underestimated by several scores.	2.9807204945349777
Mean scores of surviving and deceased patients showed a broad overlap with high standard deviations.	3.4762823935075082
Preoperative risk scores are effective tools for stratification of patient populations and the analysis of surgical outcome.	3.633155032772235
With the aid of risk scores, operative risk can be sufficiently predicted for patient populations or subpopulations.	3.4724277421679153
The Euro score best predicted the outcome of our patients.	3.973446211558066
However, when the indication for surgery is to be determined in an individual patient, risk scores should be only considered as an orientation in the decision process.	4.368077465404456
Background and objective: A complicated course of erysipelas is not uncommon.	2.9646997935212824
Bullous, haemorrhagic, necrotic and purulent lesions may be encountered.	2.839486243126633
Based on the analysis of patients with erysipelas at the Department of Dermatology in Graz, factors determining the risk for complicated erysipelas should be identified.	3.6861854365554385
Patients/Methods: In a retrospective case-control study clinical data sheets of 766 in- patients treated at the department were evaluated with respect to the course of the erysipelas and with respect to potential risk factors.	4.165446133758848
Hepatic and renal disease and - to a lesser extent - diabetes particularly predisposed for bullous and haemorrhagic lesions, while vascular occlusive disease enhanced the risk for ne- crotic lesions.	3.007314251858928
Conclusions: Location and hepatic and renal disease are the most important risk factors, while diabetes is probably of less significance than previously suggested.	4.026828188736932
Patients with end-stage liver disease frequently develop combined coagulopathies due to increased procoagulant and fibrinolytic turnover as well as thrombocytopenia.	3.2864721659905376
The onset of clinical symptoms of a haemorrhagic diathesis requires balanced substitution of coagulation factors, since fresh frozen plasma alone does not always maintain a sufficient haemostatic potential in these patients.	3.0248171269456408
This substitution commonly follows standard rules based on the assumption that 0.5 - 1 IU of a coagulation factor or inhibitor concentrate given per kg body weight will increase its endogenous activity by 1%.	3.2336457497270574
We set out to investigate the validity of this standard regime in patients with end-stage liver disease scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation.	3.8628519529132577
Fifty-one adult patients were prospectively studied.	3.498498665849771
In 37 patients with antithrombin III (AT III) activity <70%, an AT III preparation (Kybernin, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was given preoperatively (mean dose 2616 +/- 207 IU) following standard calculations in order to increase endogenous activity to 80%.	3.0578749605054742
Twenty-seven of the patients had chronic hepatic failure (CHF group) with histologically proven cirrhosis and 10 had acute hepatic failure (AHF group).	3.4747825501156235
Blood samples were drawn prior to a 15-min infusion of AT III concentrate and 30 min thereafter.	3.105565702245346
In 14 patients with prothrombin time (PT) <40%, AT III levels had been corrected earlier during the clinical course to achieve activities >70%.	2.9055468457309055
Prothrombin complex (PPSB, Beriplex, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was substituted (mean dose 2304 +/- 289 IU) to increase procoagulant activity to PT >60%.	2.68163467546081
Blood samples were drawn in the same fashion as in the AT III group.	3.6551882823802164
The amounts of AT III and PPSB concentrates ( AT III, [IU/kg];  PPSB [IU/kg]) required to increase AT III activity and PT, respectively, by 1% were calculated.	3.582164502420498
Standard calculations for AT III substitution indicated AT III recovery in all 37 patients who received AT III concentrate.	3.1649997950887405
However, there was a statistically significant difference between patients with CLF and ALF.	3.7705251926927335
In patients with CLF,  AT III was found to be 0.8 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) and in those with ALF it was 1.5 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) (P<0.05,  t-test).	3.213489417579077
In patients treated with PPSB concentrate,  PPSB was 1.6 U/kg ( +/- 0.2 SEM) for both CLF and ALF groups.	3.2058914980197906
In patients with end stage liver disease standard rules for substitution with AT III-concentrate are adequate only for patients with CLF.	3.3393731725050992
In patients with ALF higher AT III doses are required to achieve the expected effect on endogenous AT III activity.	3.110679127201248
Procoagulant activity, as reflected by PT, can be increased by 1% when 1.6 IU/kg PPSB concentrate is given.	3.341917195034954
However, this study shows the effects of coagulation concentrates only 30 min after administration.	4.007501985934956
An increased volume of distribution and increased turnover may explain the poor recovery of AT III activity in the ALF group, indicating that the dose of coagulation concentrate should be estimated against the background of the patient's clinical symptoms and diagnosis.	3.669583781200593
Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis.	5.142748376426339
Rapid exhaustion and reduced exercise tolerance leads to difficulties in maintaining a normal daily life for many patients.	2.937754490692761
Regular resting and short breaks can help to compensate this to a  certain degree.	3.6107016390113222
A sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time.	3.418767318276911
Both occasions were associated with menstruation.	3.6471585558664104
Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in the tracheal secretions once.	3.6102481502522217
Discussion: The etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described.	3.6097082070677895
The toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 acts as a superantigen in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	3.272534359288702
This case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar immunopathogenetic process.	3.2083056284918516
Porokeratos of Mibelli is a rare inherited disorder of epidermal keratinization, whose pathogenesis is not fully understood.	3.5926259122435718
The common clinical feature is a erythematous plaque surrounded by a hyperkeratotic border.	2.789121550557885
The histopathologic hallmark is a parakeratotic cornoid lamella.	2.8776008272963445
An unusual case of porokeratosis gigantea, a morphological variant of classical porokeratosis of Mibelli, is reported.	2.8308762489417116
The pathogenesis, taking in account especially the clonal hypothesis and premalignant nature of porokeratosis, is discussed.	2.7636519129376715
With the introduction of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines.	3.497749967741335
We report two cases with high-dose usage and dependency of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	3.0313082824041144
While one patient had a polysubstance abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient.	4.050885754541146
To reduce withdrawal symptoms long-acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients.	3.170231124416419
Thus, it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	4.22516097090742
Considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	2.9473189209850426
Fractures of the proximal radius in children may lead to deformities of the radial head and functional disturbance of pro- and supination.	4.007255620553378
However, traumatization is not only caused by the injury itself, but may also occur secondary to surgical reduction, manipulation of fracture fragments and excessive physiotherapy.	3.696674631801788
In a prospective long-term follow-study (2-20 years after trauma) of 38 children with displaced proximal radius fractures we found functional disturbances in 11 % of children only.	3.4250606448859524
These were not caused by radial head deformities, which were present on 83 % of follow-up radiographs.	3.8766761465093666
Functional impairment was mainly seen after open reduction or secondary growth disturbances.	3.4369520424245024
On follow-up radiographs all conservatively treated fracture angulations up to 60  ° had corrected themselves spontaneously.	3.199131341858821
In view of the high complication rates after open reduction and the poor functional results, as well as the inconvenience for the pediatric patient and the economic aspects, we recommend a primary conservative treatment concept of proximal radius fractures in children.	4.079917713912459
Patients who have undergone cardiac surgery with use of extracorporeal circulation frequently reveal marked hypovolaemia in spite of a highly positive fluid balance.	3.2117913549955057
This is thought to be due to transient microvascular damage and extravascular fluid shift.	3.510898310357994
Further volume replacement to achieve haemodynamic stability in the postoperative period may cause fluid overload and congestive heart failure.	3.11829019126035
The present study was designed to investigate whether this fluid overload could be avoided by using a hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution (group I: HHL, 10% hydroxyethylstarch 200/0.5 in 7.2% saline) instead of two different standard colloid solutions (group II: HA, 5% albumin; group III: HES, 6% hydroxyethylstarch in 0.9% saline).	2.9283084714820466
Purpose: The temporomandibular joint is a place of motion where release of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces cartilage destruction via production of nitric oxide (NO).	2.9641655118667565
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous passive motion in the form of cyclic stretch on the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).	2.8397677362593323
Methods: Articular chondrocytes were harvested from rabbit cartilage slices and cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.	2.774399805853369
Subsequently, cells (105/ml per well) were transferred to Flexercell plates, grown to 90% confluency, and subjected to one of the following regimens: (1) no mechanical strain (10 Hz, 20% elongation rate); (2) rhIL-1 (1 ng/ml); (3) mechanical strain; (4) mechanical strain and rhIL-1.	3.8037374512467386
The cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged on microscope slides in a cytospin centrifuge.	2.846988142885145
The presence of iNOS was determined by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using polyclonal rabbit anti-iNOS as primary antibodies, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as secondary antibodies.	2.688685287746602
Diaminobenzidine was used as substrate for HRP.	3.7056122699653655
Total NO production was spectrophotometrically measured in the supernatants of cultures using Greiss reaction.	2.8876816817221527
All experiments were done in triplicates and the statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t-test.	3.3574141785360703
Results: Cells with treatment 1 and 3 did not exhibit presence of iNOS.	3.54067558228542
IL-1-treated cells in group 2 exhibited intense peroxidase staining.	4.263163602537921
Cells in group 4 exposed to IL-1 and mechanical stress showed staining with considerably less intensity.	3.1104749943221095
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that continuous passive motion exerts anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes, downregulating the quantity of iNOS -positive cells.	2.9518842040796853
Since NO acts as an intracellular, transcellular, and cytotoxic molecule, it has a basic importance for proper post-traumatic and postoperative TMJ function as well as the course and therapy of inflammatory TMJ diseases.	3.928897129396494
Recently, we presented an implantable piezoelectrical hearing aid transducer.	2.951863694984873
Its characteristics make it suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	3.8062086392496344
The transducer transmits micromechanical vibrations instead of sound into the hearing organ.	2.8506970073612448
After determining preoperative (acoustical) BERA threshold, the middle ear was opened and the piezoelectrical transducer coupled to various ossicles or the perilymph.	3.132081403853412
BERA responses were recorded following stimulation of umbo, long incus process, stapes head, stapes foot plate, and vestibulum.	2.912551293349865
By comparing the acoustical and mechanical threshold, a correlation was found between the stimulus level of acoustical and mechanical stimulation.	3.202825514444605
An electrical transducer voltage of 1 Vrms* was equivalent to sound-pressure levels between 100 and 128 dB SPL at the tympanic membrane.	2.8414664347915926
To judge hearing impression, stimulus-dependent latencies of the early acoustically and mechanically evoked potentials (waves P1 to P5) and their thresholds were analyzed.	3.141095752358843
After coupling the piezoelectrical transducer to the long incus process, latencies corresponded well to stimulation.	3.2129598033916213
They were almost completely similar when the equivalent sound-pressure level of 100 dB SPL was achieved by the transducer voltage level.	3.1141220616218375
Pyoderma gangrenosum was first described in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.	2.853243600991269
Devergie interpreted those enlarging ulcers as a side effect of mercury therapy.	3.37040308306421
Thus we were able to find evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum more than 100 years before first description in 1930.	3.480795676229331
The etiology of this clinical picture is still unsettled.	3.2183863319440413
The favorite postulate has been a bacterial genesis which was the subject of numerous publications until the 1960s.	3.6748010464501615
Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by progressive autonomic failure with cerebellar, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs.	3.2472992954123234
In MSA patients laryngoscopy often reveals unilateral or bilateral abductor vocal fold palsies.	2.8566166588272477
However, assessment of sites of obstruction and their severity is needed.	2.9656164927736217
We report our clinical experience in managing a 56-year-old, obese male MSA patient (1.76 m height, 100 kg weight, BMI 32.3 kg/m2) who was admitted for evaluation of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness.	3.134418139214734
Endoscopy while awake demonstrated an incomplete abductor vocal fold palsy.	3.158594264165157
Polysomnography confirmed heavy snoring with arousals (11.1/h) and an RDI of 1.4/h.	3.2360545065382316
Sleep efficiency was low (51.9%) due to long intermittent awake periods.	3.2114823442436586
Sleep videoendoscopy of the upper airway proved the entire pharynx to be open during REM and non-REM sleep.	3.6592880850781624
This was regularly terminated by arousals.	3.0295414853826754
The further treatment is discussed.	3.422392765846724
In general, glottic snoring without daytime stridor is rare and has only been described in MSA patients.	3.2839470029355846
However, certain of these patients will also be pharyngeal snorers.	3.94025431937986
The source of the sound and site of obstruction can only be diagnosed by sleep videoendoscopy.	3.72579094410765
Introduction: Homografts for valve replacement are indicated in acute valve endocarditis.	3.4067387844225716
It is assumed that they possess anti-infective properties.	2.6420508634061814
Homografts are an established indication in aortic valve replacement.	3.864358807814241
We present our early results with homografts for mitral valve replacement in acute endocarditis.	2.890665206068599
The surgical management of enlarged inferior turbinates has been actively debated for more than a century.	2.9414609877137385
The second part of this review decribes the following techniques: laterofracture, submucous turbinectomy, concho-antropexy, partial turbinectomy, anterior turbinectomy, inferior turbinoplasty, total turbinectomy, and vidian neurectomy.	2.6510301926023563
Indications, advantages, disadvantages, complications, and controversies of each treatment modalitiy are reviewed and discussed.	3.2086720360626666
Total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed.	2.9814915038452265
Acute oxalosis may come about by ethylene glycol poisoning; in recent years iatrogenic cases of acute oxalosis have also been described following iv treatments of naftidrofuryl, a vasodilator.	3.146476687020428
Furthermore, chronic asymptomatic intestinal oxalosis may turn symptomatic by a superimposed major load of oxalate.	2.8660517795542804
Acute oxalosis results in acute renal failure; in addition oxalate-induced angiopathy may be associated with necrosis of affected tissue.	3.456316314152839
In terms of therapy, hemodialysis should be used promptly in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and a worsening of the renal function.	3.8304922216809487
In cases of a secondary chronic intestinal oxalosis prophylactic measures such as maintaining an elevated urinary flow rate and prescribing oral calcium supplements will be helpful.	2.8802146453588664
Generalized granuloma annulare is a rare variant of granuloma annulare affecting the trunk and extremities with a multitude of lesions.	3.5178645523939696
In contrast to localized granuloma annulare, generalized granuloma annulare occurs in older patients, shows a stronger association with diabetes, and is characteristically chronic.	3.4250448119222194
Like our 55-year-old patient, most patients present with papules and annular plaques; less often, macular or non-annular lesions may be encountered.	3.2124054493256424
Histology often fails to show necrobiotic or necrotic connective tissue changes demarcated by a palisading granuloma.	2.836537177082988
Instead, there are diffuse dermal, band-like or nodular aggregations of histiocytes intermingled with some multinucleated giant cells and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the periphery.	3.0365310489617716
Because of its special characteristics, it has been suggested that generalized granuloma annulare might constitute a separate disease entity and that it should be classed among the primary cutaneous histiocytoses as a diffuse dermal histiocytosis.	3.2631760489631083
Using immunohistochemistry to determine the macrophage phenotype of the lesional histiocytes, we have shown that generalized granuloma annulare is not a cutaneous histiocytosis.	4.368538018039718
Neither MS-1 high-molecular-weight protein, a new specific marker for cutaneous non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses, nor CD1a, the well-known marker for Langerhans cells and Langerhans cell histiocytoses, is expressed by the lesional histiocytes of our patient.	3.080282240974998
In contrast, the antigen expression pattern was diagnostic for non-infectious granulomas and was highly similar to that in localized granuloma annulare.	3.1779424246985224
In contrast to the successful treatment of localized granuloma annulare reported with intralesional interferon -1, systemic treatment with interferon -2b (9x106 units three times a week) was ineffective.	3.3397059850130213
The aims of the study were: (1) to predict reversal time from intensive atracurium blockade; and (2) to determine the optimal time of neostigmine administration during recovery from atracurium blockade, i.e., the time at which the administration of neostigmine results in the shortest total recovery time (time from administration of last supplemental dose of atracurium to train-of-four [TOF] ratio 0.70), and at the same time results in the shortest time from administration of neostigmine to TOF ratio 0.70.	3.7255609197021355
The spontaneous and neostigmine-facilitated recovery in 52 healthy women anaesthetised with thiopentone, fentanyl, droperidol, and nitrous oxide was followed.	2.9442312076884223
Post-tetanic count (PTC) of TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve and mechanomyography were used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission.	3.170276476684032
The neuromuscular blockade was induced with atracurium 0.6 mg/kg and supplemental doses of 0.15 mg/kg were given when the first twitch response in the TOF (TH1) had recovered to 20%.	3.4983489682880347
Neostigmine 0.036 mg/kg body weight was given at different levels of neuromuscular blockade to 37 of the patients.	4.026175871345606
Multiple regression analyses including pre-reversal time (time from administration of the last atracurium dose to neostigmine administration), PTC, weight, and age of the patients suggest that pre-reversal time is the best predictor of reversal time: reversal time=27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time [min]; (SEE=6.0 min).	3.0389764530702585
If pre-reversal time is unknown, PTC can be used: reversal time=24 min-(4.5xln PTC) at time of reversal); (SEE=6.8 min).	3.370833429198676
Total recovery time was 47 min (SEM=2.0 min, n=15) in the patients allowed to recover spontaneously, and 29 min (SEM=1.2 min, n=29) in the patients reversed by neostigmine; the difference of 18 min (SE diff 2.0 min) was significant (P<0.0005).	3.823133151701232
The level of blockade indicated by PTC (1 - 24) at the time of reversal had no influence on the total recovery time.	4.066672555854489
The spontaneous recovery times from reappearance of TH1 and TH1=10% to TOF ratio 0.70 were 29.2 min (SEM=1.7 min) and 24.4 min (SEM=2.6 min), respectively.	3.0900287363126107
The results suggest that pre-reversal time is the strongest predictor of reversal time when neostigmine is administered during intense atracurium blockade.	2.617222934646264
To achieve the optimal time-saving effect, neostigmine must be given 18 min (the time saved by giving neostigmine) plus 7 to 11 min (needed for neostigmine to reach its peak effect), giving a total of 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70.	3.1304783746856133
As TH1 is between 1% and 10% 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70 is reached during spontaneous recovery, the optimal level of neuromuscular blockade for neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade is when TH1 is between 1% and 10%.	2.6541217557784647
Reversal time can be predicted as 27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time (min), and the optimal time of neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade appears to be when TH1 is 1% - 10%.	3.4009928496615447
A seminar for hospital physicians in management positions (Württembergische Verwaltungs- und Wirtschaftsakademie, Stuttgart) in October 1994 illustrated the immediate relevance of W. R. Bion's book Experiences in Groups and Other Papers, published in 1961.	2.57597976955769
The aim of this article, recalling Bion's experiences in groups by presenting in seminar's leadership principles, is to show how these experiences can be applied to an understanding of the individual.	3.503710648656021
If continuous seizure activity lasts longer than 5 minutes generalized tonic-clonic seizures require prompt treatment, if significant morbidity and mortality are to be avoided.	3.136440676101852
The mortality varies (mean: 20%) depending on patient age and etiology.	3.0569260057384957
Control of status epilepticus is achieved by benzodiazepines in about 80% of cases: Lorazepam is recommended due to its longer-acting effects on the central nervous system.	3.53313202686408
To maintain the anticonvulsive effect phenytoin is usually administered intravenously.	2.954864722803317
Fosphenytoin (not approved in Germany) has advantages over phenytoin, because it can be given three times more rapidly and produces fewer side effects.	3.5490286513706977
The IV use of valproic acid in status epilepticus seems to be promising, but needs further evaluation.	3.302880967006088
There is no generally accepted treatment protocol for the therapy of persistent seizure activity lasting more than 60 minutes (i. e., refractory status epilepticus).	3.287650933947228
Usually phenobarbital, or general anesthesia with thiopental or pentobarbital are treatment recommendations.	3.1447304597821075
In recent reports, the administration of midazolam or propofol proved to be effective and well-tolerated.	4.338298374599171
Since the life span of our society is increasing and the expectation of high functional demands is growing more and more older people take part in sports activities emphasises the necessity of early diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions and their correct treatment.	3.232470896560208
The goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology.	3.2896512181053246
New arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further.	3.0409379978073106
In cases of large and complex cuff tears the surgeon can individually select an adequate reconstruction procedure which includes anatomical-, partial-, tendon-transfer and muscle-transfer repairs.	2.885022246680404
In cases of irreparable tears with cuff-tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered.	2.6971306288563333
Based on clinical, radiological and arthroscopic findings we developed algorithms that will lead to the best suited procedure for a given lesion.	3.928927611313323
These symptoms can develop  years before death and may severely affect quality of life.	3.0407658335359353
Non-invasive intermittent home mechanical ventilation (HMV) via mask is a possible palliative measure for  these symptoms, which is not often used in  Germany.	3.6855637680402085
We report on our experience with HMV in 24 patients with ALS.	3.8198205348674117
Our data show a good palliative effect in 17 of 24 treated patients.	3.3030333332518875
The mean ventilation time at present is  14 months.	3.2024155985254925
Available options and their  consequences need to be discussed in detail with patients and relatives before HMV is  initiated.	4.010217093910595
Many clinical studies have been performed investigating corneal endothelial cell loss after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods.	3.444706526154579
Most studies, however, included variable follow-up intervals, neglecting the dynamic cell loss over the course of time.	4.200610549139847
The aim of this study was to perform endothelial cell evaluation 5 years after penetrating keratoplasty using two different storage methods.	2.751678398489851
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is generally associated with ulcerative colitis (UC).	3.1226752707319245
The disease typically progresses slowly, but ultimately, and leads to cirrhosis, liver failure or bile duct cancer.	2.973325128365675
PSC patients with simultanous ulcerative colitis are also at higher risk for colorectal cancer.	2.8977786704470416
At the present time, there is no effective treatment for PSC, although preliminary data show encouraging results after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid.	3.5045085015592354
However, there are no data concerning the delay or prevention of progress of the disease with this drug, because follow-up time is not yet long enough.	3.8634961599230397
Isolated bile duct strictures should be treated endoscopically.	3.939634798471579
The possible effect of proctocolectomy on the course of PSC is controversial.	3.3704683900833157
Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for PSC in its final stage.	3.8620955483993304
The 5-year survival rate (89 %) is significantly better than after transplantation for other indications.	3.176385703823565
Patients with ulcerative colitis have to be followed up by lifelong colonoscopy.	3.8408744921230222
Although the course of UC after transplantation is mostly asymptomatic, these patients are at higher risk for colorectal cancer.	3.4477696193800966
On 3 June 1998 a high-speed train (Inter City Express, ICE) collided with a bridge at a speed of 200 km/h.	2.897489719155386
The bridge collapsed and the rear wagons of the train were pushed into it with the power of the rear engine.	2.9933829238979923
The accident caused 101 deaths and 103 injuries.	3.1007522093511595
Four minutes after the accident the alarm was raised, and 16 minutes after the accident the first doctor was on the scene, arriving from Celle, approx.	3.1320541413874006
Severe complications after chiropractic treatments rarely occur.	2.974254565991937
They happen mostly when manipulating the atlantoaxial and the craniovertebral articulations or when not attending to the contraindications like partial dislocation and hemivertebra.	2.7124091887534716
Therefore, x-ray pictures from the part of the vertebral region to be treated are inevitable and likewise the medical scientific associations demand them uniformly to minimize the risks.	3.7489372405904136
In patients with painful, possibly hemorrhagic vesicles or black crusts, especially on hands/fingers or face/neck with typical history (contact to cows or feral/cats) the possibility of a cowpox/catpox infection has to be considered.	2.6712260647583332
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with the electron microscopy; cytoplasmic inclusions may be detected histologically.	3.0265408693358755
Further useful diagnostic tools are the identification of the cowpox/catpox virus by PCR or in cell culture as well as serological tests to detect virus specific antibodies.	3.855578592309381
We report the development of typical skin lesions of a cowpox/catpox infection in two female patients who had contact with cows or cats.	3.5767902913217946
Recent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are also discussed.	4.087635135551996
The laboratory findings of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets are signs of an acute pregnancy complication often associated with abdominal pain and intrauterine growth retardation.	3.645361526837463
A high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed.	3.157701976520715
The high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade.	3.5945737633940573
However, the fact that HELLP syndrome can also occur for up to 1 week post-partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question, in particular, since there is a high rate of hemostasiological complications after cesarean section in acute HELLP syndrome.	3.443558913710486
Because of the correlation of complications of HELLP syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia, the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features.	3.926075255415284
The results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in HELLP syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept.	2.5891745944629196
Innervation of the head and neck differs from other regions of the body in certain respects.	4.113389543919234
In particular, besides the external cuneate nucleus, thick-calibre neck muscle afferents project directly, to the vestibular nuclear complex.	2.895965768550389
This projection is most prominent in segments C2 and 3 and is sparse or absent in more caudal segments.	3.1999881386443727
Thus, proprioceptive neck muscle afferents gain direct access to vestibulospinal, vestibulooculomotor and other secondary or even higher order vestibular neurons that receive labyrinthine input.	2.6860064366437317
Proprioceptive input via indirect spinovestibular pathways is also most prominent from C2 and 3 compared to more caudal levels.	3.02780794523689
Likewise, thin calibre, mainly nociceptive afferents from cervical segments are channelled via the parabrachial nuclei in the rostral pons to limbic structures different from the targets of thoracolumbar afferents.	2.645457521912849
It is tempting to consider these neuroantomical peculiarities relevant for the pathogenesis of the puzzling symptoms after whiplash injury.	3.2755230028748303
Real bone tumors are rarely encountered in the daily routine of radiological practice.	3.594753881085954
Therefore, for a general radiologist there is no need for a specialist knowledge on this field.	4.2481899606397
However, he should be able to distinguish benign from malignant lesions in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies.	3.750687984746929
A systematic approach towards osteolytic lesions, e. g. according to the classification of Lodwick, is mandatory.	3.509455916051556
CT and MRI are indicated to clear up the anatomy in areas of superposition artefacts in conventional radiology and to determine the inner structure of a lesion, e. g. fatty tissue, liquid/solid.	3.4711547332778516
This paper highlights the advantages and disadvantages and the cost-effective use of the imaging modalities including scintigraphy in the diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions.	4.754032718240128
Guidelines for the management of bony lesions will be given in detail.	3.8949181146677065
The option and necessity for a specialist second opinion is emphasized.	3.405827536273108
During routine middle ear surgery prototypes of implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducers were coupled to the ossicular chain of 28 patients.	3.0658531539140097
Pure tone thresholds in a broad frequency range (250 Hz-8 kHz) and perception of music were the basis of psychoacoustic evaluation of the transfer properties of the prototypes in this human study.	3.797670009308469
The piezoelectric transducer reached an equivalent transducer sound-pressure level of up to 145 dB SPL and frequencies of 10 kHz.	3.0712441069205942
The dynamics for music reached 32 dB, which was identical with the results of the preoperative investigations using hi-fi headsets (33 dB).	3.6621664840173658
The low nonlinear distortions of around 0.1% and the frequency range up to 10 kHz are reflected in the positive evaluation of sound quality by 84% of the patients involved.	3.5184189052978705
The study is the basis for realizing a piezoelectric transducer designed for routine clinical implantations.	3.5982151971226672
The transducer is thought to be part of a totally implantable future hearing aid for rehabilitation of moderate and severe sensory neural hearing loss predominantly in the middle and high frequency range.	3.460632890554878
Background: Baker et al.	2.9630985210517156
used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty for the first time.	3.390729437114409
The ultrapulse CO2 laser provides a sophisticated instrument that makes more application alternatives possible in ophthalmology.	2.9491966628044395
So far the major interest focused on degenerative processes on the deprived side, while effects on the contralateral untreated side were not taken into consideration.	2.9301105949868793
This ontogenetic study investigates effects of early monaural acoustic deprivation on the functional development of the acoustically evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) in the Mongolian gerbil.	3.562123275661407
Young gerbils were deafened by a single intracochlear application of neomycin sulfate.	2.88366217253097
The ABR development on the contralateral side differed in a late developmental period from that of normally hearing animals.	3.2861723582758264
These changes persisted until adulthood.	3.032642060548676
Between day 55 and day 90 a significant 5 dB decrease of the ABR thresholds and a significant shortening of the interpeak latency II-V occured.	3.3561805468583112
The results confirm that a complete monaural deprivation during the sensible or critical period leads on the contralateral side to plastic or compensatory changes in the auditory brainstem.	3.1616191352322724
There are estimated to be 20 million people blinded by cataracts, 80-90 % of whom live in rural areas of developing countries where expert surgical resources are scarce.	2.859667720999601
The majority of all cataract operations are still intracapsular extractions (ICCE).	2.735209417342245
Aphakic correction using spectacles is problematical in developing countries.	3.147235943878442
This study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of multiflex open loop anterior chamber intraocular lenses (AC IOLs).	2.988912439754878
Dorsal fusion with the internal fixator has become the standard treatment of instabilities and deformities of the thoracolumbar spine.	3.522130718399359
With our new device, the modular spine fixator (MSF), which has been specially designed for short-distance instrumentations, we have increasingly been treating unstable injuries of the thoracolumbar spine by one-level stabilization.	3.556871994126884
Prerequisite is an accurate evaluation of the indication, including CT and MRI to assess the involvement of the intervertebral disc and the ligamental structures.	4.947905690849964
The operative technique differs in some details from the procedure in moremulti-level instrumentations, especially concerning the application of the pedicle screws.	3.1794254102610098
The instrumentation is always combined with posterior allogenic bone grafting.	3.1507846655191076
Since the beginning of 1993 we also perform anterior autogenic transpedicular bone grafting.	2.96568067532059
Between Januar 1991 and July 1995, 57 one-level stabilizations with the MSF were performed.	3.1268609414765667
Of the 57 patients operated on 39, 27 men and 12 women, with an average age of 41 years, have had a clinical and radiographic follow-up examination so far, on average, 27 months after the accident.	4.034708540967818
Seventeen patients were completely free of pain and 17 patients (were only) sensivite to weather changes or had minor pain during great physical stress.	3.1354333803389056
Five patients had pain even during slight physical stress or at rest.	3.096028493486891
The patients' range of motion was normal.	3.2183444069202993
Only five minor complications have been seen.	3.7831067345938028
No implant fatigue failure has been noted in this series.	3.340768423930498
We derive from these results that, for correct indications, one-level stabilization can be performed successfully and should be firmly established in the operative treatment of unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.	4.017179064980931
Between May 1995 and March 1996 we were able to diagnose and remove glomus tumors of the left nasal cavity from three female patients.	3.960337803104727
Ages of the patients were 9, 36 and 74 years.	4.415588893098828
All patients suffered from a frequent epistaxis and all were extremely sensitive to the slightest nasal touch.	3.247931999361618
One patient reported breathing difficulties due to nasal congestion.	2.9204711038448763
Examination revealed a tumor that filled the entire nasal cavity.	3.390071765741183
Hemangiopericytoma, non-chromaffin paraganglioma,  hidradenoma, cavernous hemangioma and nevus cell nevi have to be excluded by histology and immunohistochemical techniques.	3.4098457528640598
From a clinical perspective the bleeding  septal polyp (granuloma telangiectaticum sive pyogenicum sive pediculatum) has to be considered because it often comes from Kieselbachi's plexus, has a mushroom-like appearance and bleeds slightly.	3.0058981134606575
Background: Gynaecological surgery including laparoscopy is frequently associated with PONV.	3.1102061763993185
Therefore, choosing an anaesthetic with only little side effects in operations eligible for outpatient surgery is at least as important as applying anaesthetics that enable fast-tracking.	3.1750157939505073
The reliability of continuous fibreoptic oximetry in cerebral venous blood and its correlation with intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures (pressure-volume curve) were examined in an experimental porcine study.	3.2746926959459204
In a population-based study of 110 women between 53 and 82 years of age (mean age 64.5 +/- 7.9 years) static posturography data were compared to functional items of gait and balance in common geriatric mobility scales.	3.1424719641512615
Posturographic data of double-stance with eyes open and eyes closed (DSEO; DSEC) did not differ from those of a group of healthy women previously tested for intact nervous system function.	3.2615142977658707
The total neuromuscular score - roughly corresponding to the well-known Tinetti score - did not correlate to the posturographic measures.	3.1932546031994367
DSEC correlated with the items "rapid walking" and "single-stance left leg".	3.600009167120763
Age, vision, and neuropsychologic test results correlated with DSEO, "rapid walking", "single-stance right leg", "single-stance left leg", and "walking a figure eight".	2.9276819707094597
Multiple linear regression confirmed the impact of age, vision, DSEO, and DSEC on "rapid walking" with a 34% variance explanation.	3.3362206083639254
Posturographic parameters did predict other selected gait and balance items.	3.207955800426869
When used in older women living independently in the community, parameters of static posturography reflect to some extent the functional disabilities of gait and balance.	3.1450622030327993
The ocular surface epithelia with the tear film as a unit provide clear vision and comfort and serve as the first line of defense.	3.092128897948503
It is important to understand how ocular surface health is maintained and how ocular surface failure occurs.	3.0426256410435837
Furthermore, it is timely to summarize new information concerning action mechanisms and clinical uses of amniotic membrane transplantation for ocular surface reconstruction.	3.015769255462046
When appropriately processed and preserved, amniotic membrane as a native matrix can be used as a graft to restore conjunctival surfaces following removal of lesions such as pterygium, tumor, scar, symblepharon, and conjunctivochalasis.	2.8781504509586524
It can also be used as a graft to restore corneal surfaces suffering from limbal stem-cell deficiency.	2.966420093812751
For partial limbal deficiency, amniotic membrane alone is frequently sufficient, while for total limbal deficiency it needs to be combined with limbal stem-cell transplantation with or without corneal transplantation.	3.2979181659334955
When used as a graft or patch, amniotic membrane can facilitate healing of persistent corneal ulcers and recurrent corneal erosion and reduce corneal haze following keratectomy.	2.9404515649177396
Reported data indicate that amniotic membrane transplantation facilitates rapid healing with recovery of a normal epithelial phenotype in the epithelium and reduces inflammation, vascularization, and scarring in the stroma.	3.103373115958508
Purpose: Evalution of MRI in radiotherapy of humeroscapular periarthritis.	3.471852912841028
Background: Presentation of current data and knowledge in the field of experimental and clinical neuroendocrinology.	3.902020215175531
According to the recommendations of the German Ophthalmological Sociaty (DOG), PRK in myopic patients between -1.0 dpt and -6.0 dpt is a scientific acknowled treatment.	2.978940277472663
The risks of the treatment, however, increase in myopia above -6.0 dpt.	4.26847815338077
Introduction: Improved socio-economic conditions have led to an increase of adult height during the last century.	4.241533422252938
If excessive height is regarded as a serious psychological handicap, final height can be reduced by early and high doses treatment with sexual steroids.	3.6115449761304808
This therapy influences pubertal development and growth of healthy adolescents.	3.1225338145037838
For that reason patients should be carefully selected, taking into account the benefits and possible side effects.	3.5007940653448717
Colour measurements were performed on powdery substances of whitish to slightly yellow colouring (cocaine samples of different composition) in order to give an unequivocal optical description of the samples and relate them to control samples.	3.5165408038753534
The examination showed that specimens of similar or different chemical composition which could not be distinguished macroscopically revealed characteristic differences in the CIE-L*a*b*-measures.	3.250005732006993
The method gives a first clue for orientation within a few minutes when comparing substances in specimens of different origin.	3.190023502009898
Eighty-five patients with grade 2 or grade 3 sprains of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint were evaluated clinically and radiographically 32 months after injury.	3.388364390715258
Group I included 34 patients with grade 2 sprains (Tossy II) and group II included 51 patients with grade 3 injuries (Tossy III).	3.334135343604334
In group I, 15 patients were treated surgically (group I a) and 19 patients were treated conservatively (group I b), while in group II, 41 patients were treated surgically (group II a) and 10 patients were treated conservatively (group II b).	4.196392297443471
At surgery open reduction and transarticular fixation of the AC joint with Kirschner wires was performed.	3.5515623638291727
Conservative treatment included the initial use of a sling or a knapsack bandage and early performance of range-of-motion exercises.	3.2687460514201385
Shoulder function was assessed according to the score devised by Constant and Murley.	3.810765973786892
In both groups, 97 of 100 possible points (minimum 72, maximum 100) were obtained after conservative and after surgical treatment.	3.1705565123108372
Nine of 10 patients (90%) with grade 3 sprains (group IIb) had more pronounced displacement and increased mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle after conservating treatment.	3.4888303675912207
After surgery, dislocation and increased horizontal, mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle occurred in 18 (44%) of 41 patients with grade 3 sprains (group II a P<0.0001).	3.439643796810274
At follow-up there was a significant increase in degenerative changes seen on radio-graphs (P<0.035) in all patients.	3.201485990789939
Again these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	3.457308620834341
More degenerative radiological changes were observed in patients who had undergone surgery (P<0.003).	4.2050391552645925
Patients with grade 2 sprains were more frequently restricted in sporting activity after surgery (P<0.05).	2.9839185113633264
Patients with grade 3 sprains who were treated surgically complained of pain more frequently (P<0.01), and they returned to work later than patients who were treated conservatively after grade 3 sprains.	4.4059742118228575
An additional rehabilitation program guided by a physiotherapist seemed to have no impact on the functional outcome.	3.531530077573336
A total of 56 patients were treated by surgery.	3.8202117800910402
Among these patients 11 complications occurred, requiring five additional surgical procedures.	2.978754877887593
Among 29 conservatively treated patients, only in 1 patient did subacromially located arthritic changes of the AC joint have to be removed.	4.152527578912132
Macular amyloidosis (MA) and lichen amyloidosus (LA) are the two major variants of the primary cutaneous amyloidoses which present with severe and therapy resistent itching.	3.794712297143525
Recently, in a few case reports authors have observed encouraging beneficial clinical effects by using topical dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).	3.0841171545640633
In our study 10 patients with either MA or LA or biphasic amyloidosis were treated with a 50% solution of DMSO in water.	3.5329669210536205
9 of them showed marked clinical improvement at the end of 6-20 weeks of treatment.	3.9255190365341877
Degranulation and depletion of the mast cells by DMSO is the most probable explanation for the rapid improvement of itching beginning within the first week of therapy.	3.9670771544595578
Remarkable flattening of the lichenoid papules which was obtained within 11 weeks of treatment is interpreted as a result of the improvement of itching and the related scratch effect.	4.040314980914336
Histological examination after treatment revealed no disappearance of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis.	3.147549651559444
In the follow-up period relapses of itching and papules were observed.	3.12786417959449
Therefore further studies are needed to find out the optimal procedure of therapy.	3.8620433389951154
As early as 1974, Brian advocated the prone position for ventilated patients [5].	2.9548088106443333
He suggested that this position might enhance ventilation of the dorsal parts of the lungs, thereby improving oxygenation.	3.9187006388254164
These considerations have been confirmed by several experimental and clinical studies [1, 6, 13, 17].	3.869440617272659
However, the prone position never became very popular in the clinical treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	3.034993782258018
Routine performance of thoracic CT scans in ARDS patients demonstrated preferential distribution of pathological densities in the dependent lung areas.	3.005346677299362
The prone position therefore could possibly benefit these patients, as shown by two recent studies [8, 11].	3.9374257352532003
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position on gas exchange and thoracic CT findings in multiple-trauma patients.	2.830887894649201
Seven ventilated intensive care patients with severe ARDS (Murray Score >2.5 [9], Quotient >0.7 [4], mean airway pressure >18 cm H2O, thoracic CT scan showing dorsal atelectases) were included in the study.	3.341589931974474
Patients were turned from the supine to the prone position at 12-h intervals using an air-cushion bed (Mediscus, Austria).	2.929822345203662
Redistribution of dystelectatic or atelectatic dependent lung areas was verified by means of repeated thoracic CT scans (Figs.	3.4925477161533887
The patients were intermittently turned for 6.5  +/-  1.1 days.	2.8230068700895448
The course of gas exchange is shown in Figs.	3.172131910502661
Initially, improvement of the respiratory quotient could only be achieved during prone positioning, from the 2nd day in the supine position as well.	4.145326310356241
Intrapulmonary shunting showed a similar trend (Figs.	3.228540957034154
No significant changes in cardiovascular parameters could be observed.	3.150840104503599
Control thoracic CT scans showed uniform reduction of atelectases in dependent lung areas (Figs.	3.198999681751362
The inspiratory fraction of oxygen could be reduced significantly as of the 2nd day (Fig.	3.4611426335134774
Constant levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume were associated with decreasing mean and plateau airway pressures (Fig.	3.093630192546821
Repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position produced long-lasting improvement of arterial oxygenation, which persists up to the end of the weaning process.	3.7137867802710667
This is in good accordance with other studies [1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17], however, this is the first study to report an observation period of more than 6 days of repeatedly turning the patient.	3.7078817937795843
These positive effects on gas exchange can be attributed to sudden improvement of the ventilation-perfusion ratio within the lung areas that become dependent after turning to the prone position.	3.082408402025897
Due to reduced hydrostatic pressure [11] and relative hyperventilation [7, 16], previously collapsed alveoli are recruited in the lung areas that become non-dependent after turning to the prone position.	2.666910323144204
After a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin, a 63 year old patient developed right-sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia, septic-toxic circulatory failure, and thrombocytopenia.	3.219662151346103
Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT) type II was diagnosed.	3.0763751825513395
Because of contraindications against thrombolysis a cava-filter was implanted, heparin therapy was stopped, and anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin was started.	2.9657462825858656
Inspite of this, an arterial thrombosis of the A. femoralis superficialis developed and had to be treated surgically.	4.180827664898047
From this time on, no further thromboembolic complications were noticed.	3.1584740652722894
Overlapping coumarin therapy was begun.	3.3104712346811302
Due to ubiquitous coumarin-necrosis, rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy.	2.6503854912878215
A second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin-necrosis without the need for re-operation.	2.9664826300493154
Subsequent coumarin-therapy, which was gradually increased over two weeks, was without further complications.	3.9083131669536524
Thus, hirudin appears to be a new and safe alternative to a therapy with the heparinoid danaparoid in HAT type II with fulminant thromboembolic complications and especially in coumarin-necrosis with critical septic-toxic circulatory failure and DIC.	3.2274257838324583
A prospective process-analysis evaluating organizational, medical and medical-technical alterations and real-time-documentation during out-of-hospital resuscitations (n=71) was performed due to the definitions of the "Utstein-Style".	3.3876773195590095
The gaseous radical nitric oxide (NO) is catalyzed by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by one cytokine inducible form (iNOS), which becomes active only within hours after the inducing event, and by two constitutively expressed forms, endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS), which are regulated by the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+.	3.050695932280612
Brain nNOS is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons, which are all excited by glutamate via the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which controls a Ca2+ channel.	2.726642910619419
After its diffusion into the extraneuronal space, NO may activate in neurons, which as a rule do not stain for NOS, soluble guanylyl cyclase and formation of cGMP as an intracellular messenger.	2.767194492134992
Beyond that, NO is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation.	3.2383814089279253
NO as a nitrosylating agent enhances disulfide bonding of vicinal sulfhydryl (thiol) groups of the redox modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex and thereby down-regulates its Ca2+ channel activity.	2.6370183370834672
Histochemically studies have revealed the presence of large number of NOS containing neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of hypothalamic nuclei.	3.4970044784116228
Numerous studies conform to the view that NO participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes, especially of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurosecretory system.	3.10093958584686
The redox-modulatory site of the NMDA receptor appears, therefore, as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	2.922828163429314
Moreover, glucocorticoids augment neuronal excitotoxicity by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake.	2.993556250378995
In attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with NO, it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox-environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of NO, acting either as a transmitter or neuromodulator or, in the worst case, causing neurodestruction.	3.3966587940270125
It seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs oxidized thiols within the central nervous system influences neuronal excitability, with NO working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition, which may alter acutely or chronically, among others, the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system.	3.0205945955349494
Purpose: To study early and late findings of macular retinal thickness in patients with hypotony following filtering procedures.	3.591144119159508
Even in the era of coronary stenting, acute coronary artery occlusion continues to represent a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).	2.973123027104827
Despite application of heparin and aspirin, abrupt vessel closure still occurs in 2-8%, depending on the definition applied.	3.570784136665932
The formation of an intracoronary thrombus plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abrupt vessel closure.	3.1435176885263676
Dipyridamole induces dilatation of coronary arteries and prevents platelet aggregation by a mechanism that differs from that of aspirin.	3.317118183205533
The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adjunctive local intracoronary therapy with dipyridamole could reduce the incidence of coronary artery occlusion following PTCA.	3.732906975673791
Secondary endpoints were defined as myocardial infarction, necessity for bypass grafting, and death.	3.419858666444397
The intravesical instillation of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) in cases of relapsed superficial bladder cancer is an acknowledged kind of prophylaxis.	3.0253413170143952
It is uncertainly up to now whether a verification of the immune systems competence is necessary.	3.349003810980575
The recommendations in this problem are very different.	3.4449968003485316
In conclusion to the recent literature we think that a verification of the immune system before BCG installation in the urinary bladder has not a prognostic value.	3.1648363345308392
Discoid meniscus is one of the commonest anatomical variations of the meniscus.	3.628887006835432
There is at the moment no consensus on the aetiology of discoid meniscus.	3.555919118114269
According to Watanabe three types can be differentiated: the complete form, the incomplete form and the hypermobile Wrisberg form.	3.233961467913231
Discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment.	3.031258395207612
Partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form, while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice, since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible.	4.217922411125553
A fourteen years old girl showed the classic signs of acrocephalosyndactyly I: dysostosis craniofacialis with hypertelorism, exophthalmus, strabism, amblyopia and cleft palate as well as syndactyly of the fingers and toes.	3.043957340009489
Since the twelfth year of life, she had suffered from papulo-pustular acne with many comedomes.	3.3427892498503877
Her menstruation started one year later.	3.668294550534401
Two elder siblings are healthy.	3.2697205284468986
The inheritance of acrocephalosyndactyly I is usually autosomal dominant, but sporadic cases are frequent.	2.9907761751710864
Objective: Cognitive dysfunction is a known problem after operations and may be especially relevant in the elderly.	3.6239779908336165
The aim of this international multicentre study was to investigate short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients and to elucidate the relevance of hypoxaemia and hypotension as causative factors.	3.377440348986793
Autosomal recessive inheritance, intrauterine growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, distinct facial dysmorphism, psychomotoric retardation, and often uncharacterized eczematous skin lesions distinguish the rare Dubowitz syndrome.	2.6521498525801137
Here a pair of monozygotic twins with Dubowitz syndrome and clear-cut atopic eczema is presented.	3.041938447432263
Humeral shaft fractures can be treated either conservatively or operatively.	4.068137750974002
Plating of the humerus is the established operative method, but recently interest has also been focussed on intramedullary nailing.	3.575581199583899
Fifty-nine cases of humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (Seidel/Marchetti-Vicenzi/Prévot) from January 1991 to December 1995 (44 fractures after trauma, 11 pathological fractures, 3 pseudarthroses, 1 re-fracture).	2.896754029744902
Closed reduction in 55/59 cases.	3.3543018682644963
No iatrogenic palsy of the radial nerve.	3.8676339332913168
Functional postoperative treatment in all 44 cases of humeral fractures after adequate trauma.	3.2641163427148996
Treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary nailing is favoured in our clinic (low complication rates, excellent or good functional results, limited approaches, small scars).	3.4891422298131123
Proximal fractures should be treated by the Seidel nail (stable interlocking of the proximal fragment); very distal fractures need Prévot nailing (reaming of condylar canals).	3.1692107914763903
Pathological fractures are an excellent indication for intramedullary stabilization.	3.5246443003211394
These patients benefit from stable fixation without intense surgical trauma.	3.033796352068141
Pseudarthrosis, according to our limited experience, seems to require plating plus bone grafting.	3.407752765030812
Plating is also recommended if revision of the radial nerve becomes necessary.	3.4931065338625347
2-4 % of vascular injuries need operative reconstruktion.	4.076781194721549
In polytraumatized patients the rate is even 10 %.	3.5163091795675614
Arterial vascular repair should precede venous reconstruction and orthopaedic stabilization due to limb threatening ischemia.	2.8730903149087883
Penetration or blunt vascular trauma result either in acute blood loss, ischemia or compartmental compression.	3.222712354275694
Reperfusion syndrom leads to vital threat of patient.	3.2134113236840007
Clinical assessment, measurement of limb pressures using a Doppler device and use of duplex ultrasonography are reliable adjuncts in the rapid evaluation.	3.219191984632198
Arteriography is rarely indicated and should be spared for patients with abnormal physical examination.	4.302736101318691
Minimizing ischemia (6-8 h) is an important factor in maximizing limb salvage.	4.028298967928917
Vascular repair include direct anastomosis or lateral suture repair mostly combined with primary shortening of the extremity.	3.2427344892852807
In most cases autogenous vein graft is required.	2.8887250131237128
Rethrombosis, arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysms are possible complications.	3.2848180660364865
Stabilisation of the fracture has priority over vascular reconstruction.	3.932896150872101
The initial steps to success are surgical debridement, adequate bony stabilization mostly by external fixation, revascularisation of vascular injury, immediate fascial decompression and early soft-tissue reconstruction.	3.104148857072652
The best results are obtained when a multidiciplinary approach is used combining expertise in orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.	3.0707292599300677
In secondary prevention, statins are cost-effective and even more cost-effective than other lipid lowering drugs.	3.327127732442649
Statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris.	4.0325785732889745
For secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, statins should be administered generously.	3.309876579614488
In primary prevention, statins are effective but not cost-efficient.	3.1786922665410486
For population based primary prevention, only dietary measures can be advocated; however, apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven.	3.1952936082327
Preventive measures have their own prize; in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it.	3.311574351200977
Therefore, such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the "direct" medical costs.	3.5614408257636194
Furthermore, successful prevention of coronary heart disease leads, due to life-prolongation, to an increase in people out of work and in disabled patients due to age and/or disease.	3.961504997261471
Therefore, an increase especially of the "indirect" costs for unemployment, pension, nursing homes, etc.	3.271345519128909
Background: There are three fields where the the biochemical cardiac markers creatine kinase (CK), its isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), myoglobin, and troponin can play an important role: (1) the primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (2) identification of patients suffering from unstable angina with minor myocardial damage (MMD) and consecutively increased risk for major cardiovascular events, and (3) assessment of coronary reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis.	3.3964892487412617
MRSA/MRSE infections are a major problem in hospitals and although in orthopaedic units the incidence is low awareness of this problem is necessary.	3.734652222674846
Once a MRSA strain has been isolated the strict use of the hygiene precautions has to be applied to avoid epidemic spread of the strain.	4.022176705055228
The patient has to be isolated.	4.037256098625165
The staff has to use gloves and gowns whilst treating the patient.	2.927697939288935
A antimicrobiel hand wash solution has to be used after taking off the gloves and before leaving the isolation room.	3.445213628428352
Patient and staff have to be informed about the pathogenity and the way of infection spread so that infection precaution rules are fulfilled.	3.598935431365857
Antibiotics should only be used in clinically well defined cases and the overall use of antibiotics should be reduced to lower the incidence of MRSA/E isolates.	4.317956709896283
The problems of an MRSA case and its successful treatment are demonstrated.	3.0897916341644187
A microphone constructed for implantation in the posterior wall of the auditory canal and a piezoelectric transducer serving as the main components of an implantable hearing aid were temporally implanted in five patients during middle ear surgery under local anesthesia.	3.334507542664422
The microphone was positioned beneath the skin of the auditory canal such that it completely covered the microphone membrane.	3.0890759736798654
The vibratory element of the transducer was coupled to the malleus in four patients with normal ossicular chains and directly to the stapes in one patient with missing incus.	3.646822841764134
The microphone and transducer were electrically connected with an external battery-driven signal amplifier.	2.955606304204857
Speech material and music were presented in the operation room at a sound level of 65 dB SPL under free-field conditions.	3.1990856752113563
The patients had to estimate the quality of speech, music, and their own voice as well as the effects of bone-conducting noises.	4.608743289570704
All patients were able to hear with the system.	2.9751340616852797
An intraoperative talk without vision contact was possible without any problems, as was understanding of numerals ("Freiburger Zahlentest").	2.9735007137776663
Perception of music was judged as "clear and undistorted with all broadband component."	2.9533649877427615
The estimation was also valid for one patient with a sensorineural hearing loss.	3.536817491696846
One patient declared the music to be "a little of unnatural."	3.7203573454271335
Bone-conducted sound was estimated as normal in two patients, better than without an implant in one patient with sensorineural hearing loss, and "somewhat metallic" in another patient.	3.8884695242899614
Hearing the own voice was considered "normal" in two cases "monotonous" in one case, and "a little bit roaring" in another case.	4.5830379783520705
An amplification factor that can be technically realized in an implantable hearing aid was necessary for one of the patients with sensorineural hearing loss to perceive music at a pleasant volume.	4.049914016630025
On the basis of this study, essential requirements for the construction of a fully implantable hearing aid are fulfilled.	3.89187022279391
We report a patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) with a first manifestation of homicide.	3.3502580582833135
On admission the patient showed a hebephrenia-like syndrom with inappropriate affect, thought disorder and  behavioral changes.	2.9631752145699606
Magnetic resonance  tomography (MRT) findings suggested a  diagnosis of MLD, which was confirmed by a decreased activity of leucocyte arylsulfatase A and an excessive urinary sulfatide excretion.	3.1745097461796448
The cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the most frequent spinal dysfunction.	3.706745041096539
Its spontaneous course is very variable, from progress to stagnation.	3.26894978165663
This makes prognosis and decision-making difficult for conservative or operative treatment.	3.422808682179096
The authors attempt to provide some basis for decision-making by observing the individual course of neural dysfunction, consideration of morphometric data and the use of functional scores.	3.332442966232116
To advise a patient, the outcome of conservative and operative treatment as described in the literature has to be considered, as well as the possible complications.	4.735873274055116
The advantages and disadvantages of surgery from the anterior and posterior approach are discussed.	3.2037881111271287
Operative planning according to the individual condition is suggested.	4.119954500099071
Operative techniques of anterior decompression and fusion are contrasted to laminoplasties.	3.2300634488152613
Subject: In a 7;11 year old boy with trichotillomania (ICD-10 F63.3), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (ICD-10 F90.1), and subclinical minimal cerebral dysfunction, Methylphenidate (Ritalin) medication resulted in a remarkable improvement: unexspected interruption of trichotillomania with regrowth of hair.	3.4182087533714003
An essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ECG signal is the splitting of the ECG into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees, neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information.	3.3899308053593593
The correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria.	4.115603604540516
The analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure.	3.673484508710863
This paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ECG.	3.620295482585362
Unlike the methods used up to now, this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ECG signal into individual features.	3.8827956969158253
Furthermore, analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other.	3.2040268940459478
The consideration underlying the procedure is that two ECGs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses.	3.1571865961676453
As this assumption is the basis of medical experience, it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ECG with those of the leads of the reference ECGs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ECG.	3.857929283480817
For this purpose, those ECGs are searched in an ECG database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ECG.	2.7110931868719557
The function of the method was established with the aid of the ECG signal database CARDIODAT with 249 ECGs for the diagnostic groups: infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of 550 ECGs.	3.344850052979829
It can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ECG signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts.	3.9815459330451
Purpose: The technical conditions, the optimized scanning protocols and the facilities of virtual endoscopy (VE) are presented in an overview.	2.997802548002204
During a 4-week ambulatory cardiacc rehabilitation program, 262 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 235 men and 27 women, 53.6+/-10.2 years, performed 30.5+/-2,9 exercise units.	2.9785435853653874
Before and after the rehabilitation program exercise, capacity was assessed by bicycle ergometry.	3.644653147025367
There was a significant (p<0.001) increase in the maximum exercise capacity at the end of the program (105.3+/-32.3 vs. 121.9+/-37.3 W).	3.3686460958231703
Physical work capacity on the 2.0 mmol lactate level improved (p<0.001) from 72.2+/-23.5 to 86.4+/-25.8 W, on the 2.5 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 83.5+/-23.2 to 97.4+/-26.4 W, and on the 3.0 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 93.1+/-23.0 to 106.6+/-26.1 W. Despite enhanced performance, heart rate remained unaltered on the 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mmol/l lactate level.	2.8155674886895823
Furthermore, ergometric performance on predefined heart rate levels was significantly (p<0.001) increased: 85/min: from 56.0+/-24.1 to 65.8+/-24.5 W; 90/min: from 62.0+/-27.3 to 71.2+/-26 W; 95/min: from 67.2+/-26.4 to 77.5+/-27.6 W; 100/min: from 71.1+/-29.6 to 80.6+/-28.1 W; 105/min: from 69.8+/-26.2 to 81.9+/-28.2 W and 110/min: from 73.6+/-28.9 to 90.4+/-29.4 W. The results demonstrate that physical performance in patients with CAD was improved by our novel ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program.	3.0082388865326872
This improvement included an increase in maximum as well as endurance work capacity; furthermore, this increase was accompanied by a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates.	3.7680098204983756
The results demonstrate an absolute increase of physical performance, more importantly an increase of physical performance at defined lactate levels in the presence of unchanged heart rates mediated by the rehabilitation program.	3.770764491037647
Thus, this increase was independent of motivational factors in the patients and/or the investigators during the re-exercise test.	3.9564597852593986
The effects were independent of pharmacological influences (e.g., -receptor antagonists).	3.6753795538923857
These findings are of clinical importance with respect to reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with CAD.	4.8539252946072
Newborn screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism are well established in industrialized countries.	3.2131523429331628
Missed cases may be not only due to errors in specimen collection and laboratory errors but also to failures in adequate follow up.	3.218622943617388
We report the case of a now 4-year-old girl whose classical phenylketonuria was diagnostically missed in the course of follow-up procedures of a pathological screening result 1067 µmol/l 17,6 mg% phenylalanine.	3.2539356091535456
The separation of whole blood into components is the state-of-the-art in transfusion of allogeneic blood.	3.3182734702245664
The main reasons are the negative effects of the buffy coat and the need for FFP.	3.250492548574862
Nevertheless, especially in Germany whole blood is being rejected more and more even as autologous blood.	3.758431612858194
However, most of the negative effects of the buffy coat do not apply to autologous blood.	2.877202348573997
Additionally, these patients usually do not develop coagulation disorders and therefore do not need plasma as a hemostatic component.	3.199761810792586
On the other hand, separation into components of autologous blood leads to an increase of costs and to logistic problems that restrict autologous blood predeposit to a few institutions.	3.058416123981742
Therefore, we have reviewed the literature in order to find a scientific basis for this.	4.4799455486379145
In addition, all references were included that contributed relevant information to the topic.	2.9765496576722685
A total of 135 original articles, abstracts, reviews, letters or editorials were analysed that referred to standard preparations and storage media.	2.5804199697529557
In 48 papers the in vivo red cell survival was studied.	3.619717456856987
28 of which fulfilled the prerequisites to be included into a meta-analysis.	3.8480758548682936
The following in vitro parameters were also evaluated: pH, potassium load of the units, ATP and DPG concentration of the red cells.	3.3885360747921873
Whole blood (resuspended in CPDA-1) and red cell units (stabilized in CPDA-1 or additive solutions) with a different buffy coat or leucocyte content have comparable pH values and red cell 2,3-DPG and ATP concentrations at the end of the approved storage time.	3.2404435059666907
The potassium load of a whole blood unit appears to be higher than red cell concentrates, but this is to some extent caused by the higher plasma content of whole blood and is not thought to be a clinically relevant problem for patients receiving only a few units.	4.231495571229436
A number of studies demonstrate that dependent upon the leucocyte content of a red cell unit, leucocyte metabolites and enzymes are released and accumulate during storage.	2.7555077599742095
A detrimental influence on the integrity of the red cell membrane was found in several in vitro studies.	4.508869084308656
Nevertheless, a significant improvement in red cell survival by leucocyte reduction was detected by only one group.	3.8632057539794653
Undoubtedly, non-hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions (NHFTR) are generally caused by an antibody-antigen interaction due to the transfusion of allogeneic buffy coat.	3.7026724992315145
On the other hand, there is some evidence that non-specific immunological mechanisms such as the release of histamine or cytokines are also capable of causing NHFTR.	3.6355300351142015
Thus, these reactions are expected to occur in autologous blood transfusion.	3.5067413802021083
However, so far, there are no data about the frequency and severity of these reactions and whether they are more likely to emerge after transfusion of blood units with a particular preparation.	4.095733896174146
Blood transfusions can cause septic complications due to bacterial contamination of the transfused units.	2.988709950116074
These fatal but rare complications may be reduced by pre-storage filtration of blood, but there is no indication that buffy coat reduction is effective.	3.6024004965296257
Three cases with septic complications have been reported after autologous transfusion, in two of which red cell concentrates (at least one was free of buffy coat) had been used.	4.000574574712826
Thus, there is no justification for the conclusion that the risk of septic complications is increased by transfusion of whole blood.	4.10685308966379
After all, whole blood and red cell concentrates exhibit only minor differences in relevant in vitro parameters.	3.5195286070454017
Hence, a higher incidence of adverse effects following the transfusion of autologous whole blood compared to autologous red cell concentrations is unlikely.	3.3330144014180463
Therefore, the 24 h in vivo recovery is considered to be the most valid criterion to assess the quality of red cell preparations.	3.5954771475199045
Physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status, mobility, and quality of life.	3.3188132733613616
However, the central focus of this contribution is not on illness-specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training.	3.103525284546789
These two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process.	3.36146719715284
The spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated.	2.99453473492283
Even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible.	3.1026951694731606
An anterior-inferior transmuscular approach through the subscapular muscle permits to implant self-locking tacks into the anterior inferior third of the glenoid rim.	3.2169273493179915
The extraarticular location of the implants makes a superomedial capsular shift possible, if required.	3.422374898286819
A total of 257 arthroscopic repairs following traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation have been carried out between 1992 and 1996.	2.8993401947290436
177 patients were treated only with bioabsorbable Suretac device.	4.036716931205078
Clinical and radiological follow up was possible in 165 patients.	3.6079725825760205
According to the Rowe score 69,7 % were classified as excellent, 10,9 % as good, 9,7 % fair and 9,7 % poor.	3.5400278121875264
Postoperative complications: the recurrence rate was 9,7 %, allergic reactions representing a foreign body reaction to the synthetic material were seen in 5 cases (3 %) and a frozen shoulder in 6 cases 3,6 %).	4.361023867187392
61 % of the patients involved in overhead or contact sports returned to their preoperative sport activities.	3.913261757230187
Contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography permits comprehensive assessment of the arterial system in the chest, abdomen und lower extremities.	3.5080317532442535
The method combines intravenous bolus application of a non-nephrotoxic, paramagnetic, extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3D data set.	3.324005475767102
High contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues, inherent three-dimensionality and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality.	3.317417095221157
Contrast-enhanced 3D MRA is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies.	2.981481139900985
This review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest, abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several clincial examples.	3.1773996880964406
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on prosthetic heart valve recipients remain critical.	2.6485389487109985
A generalized contraindication for MRI is doubtful.	3.211517146724879
MRI can directly affect patients with prosthetic valves in three ways by: 1) movement or dislodgment of the prosthesis, 2) heating, and 3) arrhythmias induced by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the image and its subsequent misinterpretation.	3.2709469084092735
Present literature that concerns the safety considerations of current values appears to be incomplete.	3.3950034872819894
Therefore, a survey of twenty-five valve manufacturers with regard to compatibility, safety or contraindication for MRI on their respective prosthetic heart valves was performed in 1998.	3.613687654330764
Those manufacturers who distribute most of the valves in Europe confirmed the safety of MRI.	3.7638564653127293
However, some gave their assurances based on inadequate data, or assigned all responsibility to the physician.	2.82821939092764
Some companies did not give any assurance for MRI safety or failed to respond to our enquiry.	3.0516077842359297
Two valve manufacturers warned against performing MRI on certain prostheses.	3.022104954528377
Based on our 1998 questionnaire, the technical issues, the clinical circumstances, the prerequisites and criteria for and the definition of safety standards for MRI on prosthetic heart valve recipients are presented in this paper.	3.4399440332471367
Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a frequently occurring degenerative illness of the aging human brain.	3.671737245028866
It is accompanied by progressive pathological alterations of the cytsokeleton which are traceable to an abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated tau protein.	3.0160187813613577
Histologically, it is possible with the help of suitable staining techniques to identify pathognomonic spindle-shaped cellular inclusions (argyrophilic grains).	3.5136535710292214
These cellular inclusions display a typical cortical as well as subcortical distribution pattern.	3.9937346356367547
The goal of the present study is the retrospective evaluation of the clinical findings from 53 individuals with neuropathologically demonstrable AGD-related changes of the brain.	4.102268291189594
Nearly one-half of the cases (49%) was classifiable as demented in accordance with DSM IV-criteria.	3.6968904389624404
Moreover, the frequency of the dementia increased significantly in relation to the growing severity of the AGD-associated pathological cytoskeletal degeneration.	3.4878206939168477
These results confirm the assumption that AGD can cause degenerative changes ranging from cognitive impairment all the way to dementia.	3.166526675994689
They also underscore the necessity of further prospective studies pertaining to the clinical aspects of this still enigmatic disease.	3.565658861357417
The major problems in the treatment of open fractures with high blood loss are hypothermia acidosis and coagulopathy.	3.9260505519027706
The following case of an grade 3 open fracture of the femur with severe soft-tissue damage, including vascular lesions, with consecutive massive transfusion, should demonstrate that the cardiac-respiratory system can still be stabilized, even if a surgical solution seems impossible.	3.5734468337403436
Our 17-year-old female patient had a widespread reddish-brown lesion on the abdomen that met the histological criteria for annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma.	3.2153331420425904
UV light was excluded as a trigger.	3.842163599263962
Other, still unknown, factors that might change antigenicity of elastic fibres must be considered.	3.2909838574030674
Spontaneous resolution suggests a transient influence of such factors.	3.2666152227397385
Differential diagnosis includes skin disorders with elastolysis; discrimination especially from mid-dermal elastolysis is not well defined.	2.96264750743887
Traumatic instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis.	4.647318189821421
It is usually treated by different bandaging techniques without the possibility of early functional aftercare.	3.1978917332691137
In the period betweeen 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1998, a total of eight patients with unstable sternoclavicular joints requiring surgical treatment were treated with Balser plates.	3.759681202051563
The population comprised sevenanterior and one posterior dislocations.	2.983057915832432
A 81-year-old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea.	3.060930566664643
Results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right-sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus.	3.6892763804086903
Because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of pulmonology.	3.798473015994901
The patient died of unappeasable hemoptysis the next day.	2.8887692632902464
At autopsy we found a 2-cm-diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration.	4.032254728284858
Histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea, which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected.	3.885232673776081
The entity of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a primary tumor of the trachea, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported.	3.8704423637303886
The benefits of epidural analgesia are well known, but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia.	3.4179177589250913
In this study, the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on 172 adult patients in three different operation groups.	3.099467921511947
An epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5-7 days.	4.381779672986549
There was no difference between the groups with respect to the effectiveness of the analgesia and patients' perception of the treatment.	3.824228088222194
Mobilization differed, as expected, between the groups, however even after the most major surgery (e. g. cystectomy with bladder substitution), mobilization was impressively unproblematic.	3.4841811040701693
Retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given.	3.556244506134375
The side effects such as sedation, nausea and pruritis were conditional partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention.	3.0005433552931073
Up to 11 % showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic.	4.156793688068113
Complications: One patient died of cerebral hypoxy due to an initially undetected subdural catheter placement complicated by severe pre-existent carotid stenosis.	3.232322796876667
In four patients, the epidural analgesia had to be stopped because of catheter migration.	3.9496230596615356
There was no clinical evidence of hematoma, abscess or permanent neurological damage.	2.873385046679788
Epidural analgesia works well in terms of analgesia, mobilization and patient satisfaction, bearing in mind the potential side effects and complications.	3.6582082558032356
It can be recommended for lumbotomy and long transperitoneal operations however not for extraperitoneal interventions in the lower abdomen such as radical prostatectomy.	3.1197843926105824
High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) provides excellent contrast between osseous structures, air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution.	3.3179318785996377
Therefore, thin-section HRCT with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures.	3.569565996432442
The indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma and tumor, the "postoperative middle ear", and malformations.	3.354048460941943
In most cases, HRCT enables differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor.	2.499564234391952
The excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells, of osseous defects of the tegmen, of the bony labyrinth, and of the tympanic course of the facial canal.	3.956406352408653
In addition, HRCT enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles.	3.2443003698881445
Although HRCT is the first method of choice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases.	4.235466968214948
This is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by MRI.	3.4538043377433634
In addition, MRI offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of IV contrast material.	3.2644604560247825
Therefore, MRI may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by HRCT.	3.080964505175514
The differentiation between a meningocele or meningoencephalocele and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by MRI.	2.918344833796988
Morbidity and mortality after emergency procedures in 105 patients with perforated colonic diverticulitis were evaluated in a retrospective study.	2.9435138461915806
In different stages of diverticulitis (Hinchey classification: I, 8.6 %; II, 14.3 %; III, 57.1 %; IV, 20.0 %) mortality was 12.4 %.	2.8652923275622606
Preoperative sepsis syndrome with leucopenia and disturbed liver function, cardiac risk factors and obesity were independent prognostic factors in multiple logistic regression.	3.315715321136328
Accompanied by immunosuppression the mortality rate remarkably increased to 33 %.	3.397033583055222
The stage of peritonitis showed no influence on the prognosis.	3.466330704718373
In multivariate analysis, surgical procedure (primary resection 12.4 %, Hartmann's procedure 61.9 %, non-resection procedures 25.7 %) showed influence only on increased general complications.	3.085837113416858
The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis is still controversial.	3.4525766830485503
From January 1992 to December 1996, 228 cholecystectomies were performed for acute cholecystitis and a total of 104 patients were operated on conventionally and 124 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery.	3.474990200874827
In a prospective study we compared the conventional with the laparoscopic technique.	2.81547088798042
The results indicated that in 19 patients (15.3 %) treated initially with the laparoscopic technique, a switch to laparotomy was required.	3.441195764941563
The operating duration was lower for conventional cholecystectomy (75 min versus 95 min).	3.1765177235386743
However, surgical and nonsurgical complication rates were similar in both groups.	3.1807507150757304
The period of hospitalization was shorter in laparoscopic operations.	3.3794198726734175
According to these results we believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis is a safe and effective procedure.	3.6672818492644397
The patients will benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic surgery without increased morbidity.	3.5100846206880427
The sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is one of the most striking developments in the treatment of melanoma.	4.092093320617949
Since the first report by Morton et al.	3.2238791287131545
in 1992, the method has been refined, and its use has increased.	3.867502869185669
Introduced as an alternative to elective lymph node dissection (ELND), it has rapidly made its way into clinical practice.	3.9001711500742706
SLND allows precise pathologic staging through removal and analysis of a limited number of nodes (false-negative rate < 2 %).	3.315146118893254
It distinguishes patients with clinically occult nodal disease from those with tumor-free regional basin who would not benefit from radical dissection.	3.3460169411801637
However, the SLND is still an experimental procedure with yet unproven utility.	2.9212624936802842
Although children are injured everyday through accidents, road traffic, leisure or sports activities, internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare.	3.5874431689318493
Diagnose and therapy follow rather empirical than analytical patterns.	3.2199652284874096
A retrospective, controlled study evaluates and recommends ways of treatment.	3.202361375945602
Traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in 76 children up to age 16.	3.636653300950021
The pattern of injury changed with increasing age, the trauma remaining the same.	3.440305597153022
Most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).	3.343504228787807
Main cause where sports activities.	3.266590365118242
Operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment.	4.259374115862909
Osseous avulsions of the cruciates and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture.	3.112215390986761
Suturing of intraligamentous ACL-ruptures as well as patellar ligaments plasty showed unsatisfactory results.	3.6911096202978007
Secondary lesions due to instability of the knee where also observed in children.	4.082890679544031
Children cannot self estimate the severity of the injury so subjective statements are insecure.	3.4101716673771763
Trauma, surgery, pain and immobilisation cause a marked malfunction of the senso-motor system which is effectively treated by physiotherapy.	3.2643894459850085
Malignant mixed Müllerian tumours (MMMT) are tumours of the female genital tract which rarely occur in extragenital sites.	2.972460332416467
We report a case of a 46-year-old female with MMMT with primary occurrence in the greater omentum.	3.007453269060284
Only 19 cases of primary extragenital manifestation of this tumour are described in the literature.	3.67238484344615
The clinical appearance, diagnosis, therapy, histological evaluation and histogenesis are discussed.	3.4248436625734917
The publication of the CONSORT Statement was aimed at the improvement of the quality of research reports of randomized controlled clinical trials.	3.5725485733352595
It contains the most important standards of high quality research.	4.230983674520012
Although originally meant for randomized studies only most aspects of this statement can be applied to other kinds of clinical studies.	3.408610467058531
The demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher.	4.074300710042127
In the region of the ankle joint, it is therefore ideal to use the arthroscope for pathology.	3.969131071805221
Indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are: soft tissue impingement, ligament instability, impingement in the syndesmosis, osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, arthrosis, and loose os trigonum of the talus.	2.82092520896526
In the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments, loose bodies, and synovitis with soft tissue impingement.	3.5678156357799313
The reported high incidence of complications, especially in terms of neurovascular lesions, can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non-invasive distraction of the joint.	5.052474406738506
Although alexithymia is found in patients with various somatic disorders, it remains unclear whether it is really related to organic disease - as proposed by the founders of the concept .[125].	3.9827203844211523
As the interplay between the experience of emotion and possible adverse effects on health is a fundamental tenet of psychosomatic medicine, alexithymia remains an interesting concept to be further explored, especially concerning (1) possible pathways linking emotion to physical illness and (2) the neurobiologic basis of emotional information processing.	3.2708537016291035
Compared to the intense international discussion on the subject, in Germany there are still many doubts concerning alexithymia: while some clinicians question the validity of the whole concept, psychiatric and psychosomatic researchers seem unsure about alexithymia's role in their search for a physiological basis to the link between emotion and physical disease.	3.1062275851248033
Our review deals with the empirical literature concerning that possible association and tries to tie in their data with modern, neurobiologically founded insights into emotional information processing within the brain.	2.794796399979618
In the etiopathology of tension type headache, vascular and autonomic disorders are discussed.	3.0431041203830524
Fifteen patients with chronic tension type headache according to the criteria of the IHS were investigated using the TCD-ergometer-test - a method used to evaluate the myogenic mechanism of cerebrovascular autoregulation - and the results were compared with the findings in fifteen healthy control subjects.	3.9116738752960436
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.	3.9382762466932766
The latter was observed in about 28% of patients already at diagnosis.	3.6961948653359955
In a similar way, the frequency of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythroid precursors, implicating an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover, hemoglobin synthesis, and degradation of the expelled nuclei from normoblasts.	3.2343532456516972
The (-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detectable in 30% of pretreatment specimens.	3.1853173454376016
Moreover, significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level, percentages of myelo- and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, and spleen size.	2.852714670421369
These variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of CML.	3.241101059930998
This simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data.	3.210189115284616
Sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) revealed a fibrogenic effect of IFN in contrast to a fiber-reducing property of HU.	2.966202069495614
The dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices.	2.9896646168568095
These included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time.	3.046776864661463
Thus, in patients with complete hematological remission following IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of CD68+ macrophages, including activated subpopulations.	3.7767856333459187
Histological subgroups showed a transition from a (nonfibrotic) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40% of patients.	3.031511399293187
This change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in 17 patients (36%), but predominantly in those under HU therapy.	3.539847059327763
In conclusion, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in CML warrants a careful morphological evaluation of trephine biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and, thus, allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process.	3.194488632491138
Computer-aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical computation leads to simplification of this investigation, and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed.	3.659629020559477
Simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized.	4.013858417900927
In contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the ICP reaches a plateau.	3.46141954946637
Our mathematical method diverges with the description of a pressure-dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models.	3.3575825111132844
For that we are able to take the non-linearity of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration.	3.4425310096513293
The intrathecal infusion test is a reliable diagnostic method for measuring resistance and compliance in patients suspected of having normal pressure hydrocephalus.	3.562529653956473
Primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is burdened by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma, especially in conjunction with craniocerebral or thoracic trauma.	4.524855840306491
This also applies to unreamed medullary nailing.	3.164422079582788
Primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure, the timing of which is not predictable.	3.9059860482658544
Plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure, but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation.	3.887749696464432
In a prospective study conducted from 1 September 1994 to 30 June 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients (average ISS: 30 points), simple femoral stem fractures (A-1 to B-3 of the AO-classification) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique.	3.242633293224411
While cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone, a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression.	2.998922796622728
At least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate.	3.3141269322208893
This allows micro-movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue.	3.6949570751174483
All of the fractures were immediately stabilized on the day of the accident.	3.1261339860765744
Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an x-linked disorder of the urea-cycle.	3.3554085451305102
With a prevalance of 1:14000 it is one of the most frequent inborn errors of metabolism.	2.8194937333645598
Heterozygous females exposed to high protein nutrition or protein catabolism, are faced with highly detrimental effects througout their lives.	2.866684716779054
Coumarin necrosis is a rare, but life-threatening complication when administering coumarin in oral anticoagulant therapy.	3.3508840315440325
Predestined areas are the breasts, hips, gluteal region, thighs or lower legs.	2.9887165568258656
Thrombotic tendencies, such as congenital or acquired changes in coagulation, lead to a higher risk of coumarin necrosis.	4.286313474102971
A direct, toxic effect of coumarin on the capillary system may also play a role.	3.2642531813358375
Although the incidence is only 0.01-0.1%, lethality lies at 15%, the knowledge of this rare complication is important in order to begin with a proper treatment punctually.	4.083224958031924
The therapy of choice is early fibrinolysis.	3.014210332747217
With special emphasis on pediatric aspects, the presently available data on the effectiveness and safety or specific immunotherapy with house dust mite extracts are reviewed.	3.547637818561441
In addition to antiinflammatory treatment and allergen avoidance, specific immunotherapy offers an approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma in those patients sensitized against house dust mites.	3.48344034561395
Controlled studies of specific immunotherapy against house dust mites show decreased symptom-medication scores and positiv effects on some lung function parameters.	2.7734770828581032
Severe side effects seem to be rare, but are more common in patients with chronic airway obstruction, in infants and with rush-immunotherapy.	4.835776907169794
From January 1996 untill February 1997 6,376 patients were treated by our group with PTCA and 3,859 (60.5%) received one or several stents.	3.2073921138596297
An angiographic follow up was achieved in 63% of the patients with 1,267 experiencing restenosis (32.8%).	4.100622985702052
Of those beeing treated with re-PTCA 302 were randomly selected for further analysis.	2.9635932239032834
In-stent-restenosis was treated with rotablator in 8 patients (2.7%), with eximer laser in 21 (7.0%) and with another stent in 48 patients (15.9%).	3.505126277021935
225 patients (74.4%) of this subselection were treated with balloonangioplasty only.	3.9119348639622276
It is not clear whether public health insurance will cover post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), whereby the question of costs being covered by private health insurance companies is not taken into consideration here.	3.1120908967070973
Regulations concerning prevention (§ 20 SGB V), precautionary medical services (§ 23 SGB V) and health examination (§ 25 SBG V) offer no legal basis for cost coverage.	3.2062449519872493
PEP is patient care in the sense of § 27 SGB V. However, this particular treatment has not yet been adapted into public health insurance financial guidelines because the federal committees have not yet made appropriate recommendations.	3.6116715639553063
This should be achieved soon, in order to eliminate legal ambiguities in this area.	3.477835723861089
The principles of the so called "new methods of examination and treatment" legal construct may support cost coverage liability.	3.1371262348131266
On the whole, however, German-Austrian recommendations concerning indication and use of PEP must be formulated more concretely and unambiguously.	3.301160903725717
If a doctor, in the case of an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, does not prescribe PEP, this would probably not be malpractice, because there are still many scientific questions to be answered.	3.898733185277673
To clarify the functional mechanism of the Esmarch device in the treatment of sleep apnea, its effect on muscle activity during sleep was studied electromyographically with and without the appliance at the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, the genioglossal muscle, and the masseter muscle in 15 patients with sleep apnea syndrome.	4.182336945973807
During the obstructive apnea the muscles showed significantly lower amplitudes than before the apnea.	3.111532544654095
No significant decrease in the amplitude was observed during the central apnea, but, after the obstructive and central apnea, significantly higher amplitudes were seen than beforehand.	3.4756489798819805
The amplitudes rose after the placement of the appliance, and the amplitudes of the genioglossal and lateral pterygoid muscles during obstructive apnea increased significantly after the insertion of the appliance.	3.851106931524122
The results suggest that the device can activate the masticatory and tongue muscle activity and indicate that the muscles activated with the appliance can prevent obstruction in the oropharynx.	3.1666322196759893
The Esmarch device not only helps avoid obstruction by mandibular protraction, but also affects function by activating the muscles.	3.1896921479370968
The analysis of the delinquency bringing disordered offenders into a hospital order institution reveals a lot of very conscious and well organized behavior during the criminal activity.	2.88826865889044
This must be taken into account in therapy and prognosis.	3.6699032507680105
The prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many industrialised and developing countries and growing to a world-wide medical and socio-economic problem.	3.0240195789318167
In a recent report of the WHO the world-wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority.	3.4034639404627987
Inadequate long-term results of weight reduction in children and adolescents and the increasing socio-economic burden to the health systems, as well as the high grade of persistence of obesity aggravate the problem and demand primary prevention efforts.Future directions of primary prevention measures could be the time of onset of obesity, the "early adiposity rebound", intrauterine malnutrition, weight gain during infancy, low energy expenditure in infants, familial adiposity, composition of food and modification of fat intake.	3.4694235651523533
Despite advances in the field of orthopedic surgery, necrosis of the femoral head still remains a serious problem.	3.823600690050171
Because of magnetic interference, this technique is not applicable in the diagnosis of posttraumatic necrosis with internal fixation, however.	4.098689689247543
This seems to be an ideal indication for ossovenography: contrast medium is injected into the femoral head under X-ray control and the venous flow is documented.	3.9367966631636375
Furthermore, it is possible to get histological samples from suspicious areas.	3.08501442975526
Ossovenography was performed in 12 patients and the results were compared with histological samples.	5.275601875002332
In every patient in whom necrosis of the femoral head was diagnosed by ossovenography (91.6 %), we also found necrosis on histological examination.	3.645329085582541
In one patient in whom physiological flow was found, there was a corresponding absence of necrosis in the histological sample.	3.447065464717671
There were no complications during ossovenography.	2.8539145120878793
The results suggest that ossovenography is a promising and reliable method for early diagnosis of necrosis of the femoral head in the presence of internal fixation devices.	3.987879211649189
To evaluate patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death the analysis of ventricular late potentials, heart rate variability and baroreflexsensitivity is helpful.	3.588442136199471
However, the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy.	3.219365268093462
For a better identification of high risk patients other methods are necessary.	3.467734967460932
In this study the impact of the chemoreflexsensitivity for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated.	3.417846617001645
For the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control.	3.235966424839275
We placed a pigtail or van Sonnenberg catheter by Seldinger or trocar technique into the abscesses.	2.6732576259223455
The primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was 85 %.	3.6019318034048524
Complications occurred in 6.4 % of the cases with a mortality of 0 %.	4.116157553226217
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses, especially in the critically ill patient.	3.632261414371985
Acute brain tissue damage or systemic illnesses can lead to local or diffuse brain edema and raised intracranial pressure (ICP).	3.375622134288732
It is obvious that in all brain injuries additional factors (metabolic disturbances, hypoxia and hypercapnia, circulatory instability) aggravating brain edema and impairing recovery of viable neurons have to be treated immediately and consequently.	3.056480203567956
Medical therapies for further treatment of elevated ICP depend not only on their mode of action and side effects but although on the specific illness.	3.9325073067079046
The different etiology and pathogenesis of developing brain edema and ICP elevation with either more local or generalized extension explain the different success of medical treatment strategies in severe head trauma compared to middle cerebral artery territory or complete hemispheric infarction.	3.2692795028473047
An algorithm for treatment of postischemic brain edema in acute hemispheric infarction was developed.	3.480300254880099
In an investigation of infection control methods for respirator systems in 89 randomly selected German intensive care units as a part of the NIDEP study (Nosocomial Infections in Germany - Surveillance and Prevention), it was found that respirator systems were exchanged daily in about 50% of the intensive care units.	3.5580553377463944
However, Craven et al.	2.706668414643725
found that changing circuits (including tubing and exhalation valve and the attached humidifier) every 24 h rather than every 48 h was independently associated with the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia.	3.2937782789995196
On the basis of these results and recent studies, the current situation in the literature was analyzed in order to make recommendations for exchanging ventilator circuits.	4.310717650435595
The key function of the uterine cervix to maintain pregnancy is biochemically characterized by an increased synthesis of proteins (e.g., collagen), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin) as well as by well-defined interactions between these components of the extracellular matrix.	3.632267905161501
In contrast to the slow phase of the cervical ripening process in late pregnancy, dilatation of the cervix during parturition requires the rapid formation and action of catabolic enzyme systems, leading mainly to collagen degradation and changes in its architecture but also to degradation of other fundamental matrix proteins.	3.17606883820127
It has been suggested that an increased production of tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1, for example, induces an increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules with subsequent extravasation of granulocytes in the cervical stroma and that the chemotaxis and degranulation of these cells within the stroma is triggered by an increase in interleukin-8 concentration.	3.3720345201579405
The proteases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-8) released after degranulation of neutrophilic granulocytes encounter an already destabilized (loss of decorin) collagenous fiber network.	2.823662890360696
The clinical consequences of this basic research is to develop new concepts in a more causal treatment of cervical pathology during pregnancy and parturition.	3.569563555650322
Objectives: The involvement of cytokines in degeneration and inflammation of human tissue is well established.	3.3419209841413515
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major agent in the pathophysiology of periarticular bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoporosis.	4.370913488132112
The rational of this study was to show that retroviral transduction of human osteoblastic cells is possible in vitro using the marker gene LacZ and the potentially therapeutic gene encoding for human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra).	3.2273410119534596
Different transduction techniques were combined to improve the rate of transduction in vitro.	4.513652476075254
The -galactosidase (LacZ) gene and the cDNA of IL-1Ra were introduced into the isolated cells by retrovirus mediated gene transfer.	3.36472232906353
LacZ activity was determined by Xgal staining, IL-1Ra was measured quantitatively by ELISA.	3.7542971060883867
By combining different techniques to improve transduction, the X-gal staining established a rate of transduction of 60%.	3.3977726476862773
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that retroviral transduction of human osteobalstic cells is possible in vitro, and leads to high levels of the synthesized transgene product.	3.2742996648345293
The rate of retroviral transduction can be accelerated in vitro.	2.756478239561907
To provide a brief review of the current state of topical treatment with capsaicin or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for therapy of chronic pain syndromes.	3.4415108628097157
We report a 72-year-old patient who developed an isolated bilateral hypoglossal nerve paralysis following head trauma with complete recovery after three months.	3.015823986490657
Since the CT scan did not show any fractures of the posterior skull base, we discuss a traction nerve injury as a possible mechanism.	3.965824598075214
Injuries of the colon and retroperitoneum are rarely observed after blunt abdominal trauma and occur in about 5 - 20 % of the patients.	3.609371237835011
The majority of complications are due to initial misdiagnoses and a delay in treatment.	3.190431592270785
Lesions of the pancreas and duodenum are the most frequent diagnoses in the retroperitoneal space, while major vascular traumata or urogenital injuries are rare.	3.4905115309978862
Retroperitoneal hematoma are most likely due to pelvic fractures.	3.6704871596281596
The survival of patients after colon or retroperitoneal injuries depends on the severity of concomitant organ trauma, the time of diagnosis, and a situation-adapted therapeutic strategy.	4.228453013162949
The treatment of the typical caudal retroperitoneal hematoma following pelvic fractures is conservative in most patients.	3.287399054102589
Early pelvic stabilization, e. g., with external fixation, is recommended in these patients.	3.6341117955490563
Central retroperitoneal hematoma in the supra - or inframesocolic space should be treated surgically, as major vascular injuries are most likely in these patients.	3.3209711100280286
Duodenal or pancreatic injuries need surgical exploration in the majority of patients; the therapeutic spectrum ranges from simple sutures to pancreatoduodenal resection.	3.4788883456148882
The treatment of colon injuries depends on the degree of peritonitis and the severity of concomitant trauma.	3.441207152033676
Early diagnosed injuries are suitable for primary repair, while deviation stomata or a Hartmann procedure with or without resection should be offered to patients with delayed diagnoses, peritonitis, or severe concomitant diseases.	3.5146042402198456
Long-lasting procedures should be abandoned in the emergency situation; in these severe cases, laparotomy should be aimed towards primary "damage control" and followed by definite surgery after stabilization of the patient.	3.436090357933213
Surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries, often involving the femoral vein.	3.9872920111734653
Because of the famous case presented by Roux in 1813, the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable, but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to ligate the femoral artery.	2.925357205622398
Zaufal's principle (1880) consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes.	3.7485919476262586
This surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever.	4.798615281753762
In the limb, the congestion induced in the vein had a positve effect on the healing process.	3.334387226873245
The surgical treatment of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis was initially (1931) aimed at achieving decompression in compartment syndromas.	3.1133430813983645
The first thrombectomy was performed in 1937, but several operations with a successful outcome were reported at the 61st annual meeting of the German Society of Surgery in the following year.	3.870272304635146
Bilateral glomus jugulare tumors are rare.	3.359269297029582
However, their treatment should preserve not only the function of the facial nerve but also the caudal cranial nerves and the middle ears in order to avoid bilateral hearing losses.	3.7380802411632397
Further, venous cerebral drainage has to be ensured in order to avoid cerebral hypertension and hemorrhagic infarction after bilateral jugular ligations.	3.5184647777754305
In the case presented bilateral glomus jugulare tumors required super-selective angiography and embolization.	2.7343996563990203
Complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid-transcervical approach without any further functional deteriorations.	2.9179901436054116
Middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus.	3.244166086587504
As the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery, venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein.	3.3595999168153314
A sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side.	3.219853379526977
Intoxication is the monotone reaction of the CNS to consumed psychoactive substances.	3.3019758970310664
Intoxication-like conditions may also occur without taking drugs.	3.6933487282155664
We then use the term "ecstasy".	3.2279842014655564
The main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood, affect, drive and initiative, train of thought and self-control.	2.9971400536974215
The diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course, occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication.	3.240023865653109
In a meta-analysis of 69 prospective and retrospective studies, we investigated the value of various surgical techniques in the treatment of lumbar disk herniations.	4.2527448145792155
Androgenetic hair loss is the most frequent reason for the topical application of hair-growth-promoting agents.	3.9904857329324868
Such preparations should arrest or even reverse androgen-induced hair follicle regression as well as prolonging the hair cycles, especially of the shortened anagen phase, and thus protect from increased hair loss.	3.4927435139691694
True evidence of drug effects on hair growth is problematic, since trichograms, the method chiefly applied by the manufacturers, fail to reveal every factor involved in the follicular activity, especially the duration of anagen stage.	3.5681395106351674
For example, an increase in the anagen rate does not always reflect a lengthening of the anagen stage, but may also be due to shortened hair cycles.	3.7089500262488544
Accordingly, drug effects on hair growth should be investigated by methods that analyse the cell cycle kinetics.	3.1188954720873094
For this approach DNA-flowcytometry of the outer root sheath in plucked anagen hairs and of complete anagen hair bulbs taken by micropreparative techniques from scalp biopsies offers a reproducible method for quick and reliable evaluation of hair growth.	2.6976000491320624
The calcaneus pseudathrosis is rarly seen in clinical workday and we coundnit find any case be reported.	2.8606879944132504
In two casese the authors present the diagnosis and therapie of a non-union after a calcaneus fracture.	3.7665799114633227
The authors point especially at anatomical characteristics and biomechanical reasons and their meaning for aetiology of pseudathrosis after a calcaneus fracture.	2.6471016228011126
A general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given.	5.074594074936682
The complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well-tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone.	2.958480583999205
However, thromboembolism of the vertebral artery facing the internal mammary artery may occur.	3.2278758864698855
The indication for intraarterial chemotherapy should always be set by an interdisciplinary board.	3.1628937129326307
In the country city of Ansbach, Germany all cases of varicella-zoster virus infection seen by dermatologists, pediatricians and general practitioneers were registered over a period of 16 months, from February 1992 until May 1993.	2.9683432194528527
152 patients were clinically diagnosed with herpes zoster and 437 patients with chickenpox.	3.364630571231772
The population-based incidence of zoster infections was 22.6 per 10,000 inhabitants per year, while the incidence of chickenpox was 42.4.	3.740132960493219
There was a slight predominance of male patients with zoster.	3.1121317102936676
There was also a marked influence of age and sex, on the localization of the involved nerve segments.	3.7024324558094275
Zoster was seen in patients of all ages but there was a clear predominance in older patients.	4.620125216972085
The peak of the disease occurred in the eighth decade.	4.280652635110104
In patients with chickenpox, the sex ratio was equal.	3.075732585641862
The disease typically occurs in children and we observed a predominance of the cases in the first decade.	4.2932961170706925
Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS) are rare disorders of the nervous system that cannot be ascribed to metatastases or to destruction of vital systemic organs by the tumor or its treatment.	3.4194264750835135
Most frequently, PNS occur in association with small-cell lung, breast or ovarian carcinomas.	3.0600489938956374
The most frequent PNS is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which at the same time has the highest predictive value concerning an underlying carcinoma.	2.835049432660129
PNS have been classified mostly under anatomical aspects but now are increasingly categorized according to specific antibodies.	3.1615677207492032
In certain neurologic syndromes (sensible and autonomic neuropathy, cerebellitis, limbic encephalitis, Opsoclonus-Myoclonus syndrome, Stiff-man syndrome, neuromyotonia, subacute amaurosis) specific autoantibodies are highly predictive for a neoplasm.	2.670720947470409
Pathogenic relevance of these autoantibodies has been demonstrated only for antibodies against (1) voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, (2) voltage gated potassium channels (VGKC) in neuromyotonia, and (3) recoverin in cancer associated retinopathy.	3.2467220212824004
The present article deals with the neurological symptoms of PNS, associated tumors, and the relevance of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of PNS.	4.394891340386474
Ewing's sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has, however, attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy.	3.6250910103751757
Its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time, including a possible origin in immature reticulum, myogenous, endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.	3.4564928508658372
Repeated reports have also suggested a possible neuroectodermal genesis.	3.4384742349828996
Convincing arguments, however, have only been brought forward during recent years, since it was found that Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11;22.	3.4707988417166384
In the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses.	2.966989658144131
There seems to be no clear border between Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation.	3.101860339186231
Histological differential diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma has been improved by immunohistological methods.	3.663510011191485
In most cases, they can be distinguished from lymphoma (leucocyte common antigen, B and T markers) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (muscle specific actin, desmin) without problems.	3.076720220257561
Apart from that, it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the MIC 2-protein, which is preferably expressed in Ewing sarcoma.	3.8571546622892803
The diagnostics of Ewing's sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t(11;22) can be proved molecular biologically.	3.3585795116375254
In contrast to the cytogenetic evidence, it is not necessary to establish cell cultures.	3.673124295647738
A prerequisite is the fast acquisition of a three-dimensional gradient-echo data set during the injection of a bolus of a T1-shortening contrast agent.	3.377529433648882
We describe the dependence of the quality of CE-MRA on technical parameters of different MR-scanners and consider some fundamental facts and practical guidelines concerning the contrast agent injection.	3.052069387566419
The present study gives a survey of radiological findings after surgical treatment of laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas, whereby the surgical procedures and the localisation of tumours found special consideration.	3.6326762865196343
Owing to advances in adjuvant therapy, the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades.	3.6938118715139017
The diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined.	3.3023867509139033
Technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures, such as Tikhoff-Linberg resection at the shoulder, internal hemipelvectomy, proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented.	3.486457520692729
The use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures.	3.6067672419330075
In the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk-adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery.	3.6760633552808857
In 10-30 % of cases, locoregional recurrence is accompanied by distant metastasis; a further 25 % develop distant metastasis within the year after diagnosis of recurrence.	3.337773345179273
In treatment of recurrent tumor in the thoracic wall, axillary or supraclavicular disease surgery plays a major role.	3.6409443716789345
Since - another long-lasting courses occur even in the metastatic situation, recurrence is not an infrequent event, and therapy then needs a multidisciplinary approach.	3.6339109951168647
Surgical techniques such as local, myocutaneous or omental flaps and mesh graft transplantation are used to cover large defects after tumor resection.	3.2649778885796565
Additional and innovative modalities are combined in the management of this complex problem: locoregional or systemic chemotherapy, topical application of chemotherapy, certain radiation regimens and in otherwise resistant tumors the experimental use of photodynamic laser therapy (PDT).	3.3116381408555635
The most important goal hereby is to restore or at least maintain organ function and quality of life.	3.0077959458871573
In acute osteomyelitis of childhood a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to prevent late sequelae.	3.718502930547146
Thus, diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role.	3.239581172196849
If acute osteomyelitis is suspected in a child, imaging starts with conventional radiography in order to exclude other differential diagnoses.	3.656983224298678
This is followed by sonography for the purpose of diagnosing a subperiosteal abscess or joint fluid from which the causative organism could be isolated.	2.8861554426832736
If the diagnosis is unclear, the next step should be either MRI or 99m Tc-MDP bone scan, depending on the possibility of clinical localization and the site of the suspected lesion.	3.657297510354855
MRI is superior to bone scan in depicting the exact anatomy, which is extremely important in spinal osteomyelitis and preoperatively.	3.809798992000212
The bone scan can show the whole skeleton in one examination and should be favored if there is no definite localization or in suspected multifocal osteomyelitis.	3.46265597414632
Rarely scintigraphy with labeled white blood cells is indicated.	3.269420132804604
The 67 Ga scan, however, should not be used in children because of the high level of radiation exposure.	5.107015791952497
The different imaging modalities are described in detail and an imaging diagnostic workup is outlined.	3.4445416337894676
In spite of all interdisciplinary efforts and functionally oriented operation procedures, there are still unsatisfying results in the treatment of cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients.	3.672508116233415
Secondary corrections involve upper lip, nose, and palate (fissures).	3.043756292055155
In some cases, it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla.	3.429895652828089
Finally, there are indications for speech improving measures and total septorhinoplasties.	3.7275349124087382
Dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant-borne prosthodontic work.	4.240382513981822
In this paper, some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described, which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary CLP care.	3.862416025747289
Damage to the respiratory system caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion and the subsequent development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main lethal factors in burns patients.	3.2463248211012683
Treatment with exogenous surfactant is one of the therapeutic options.	4.351157002595212
However, no clinical reports have yet been published about this therapy.	3.1981078354574812
We report on two patients with burn injuries of second to third degree affecting 42% and 48% respectively of the total body surface plus inhalation injury complicated by ARDS.	2.6512396415675465
Both patients were treated with bovine surfactant (Alveofact).	3.470767630304245
The therapeutic effects on oxygenation and pulmonary function were monitored.	3.355703873291538
Intrabronchial application of surfactant by bronchoscopy during exhaustive conventional mechanical ventilation resulted in improved gas exchange with an increase in arterial O2 pressure (paO2); inspired O2 concentration (FiO2) was lowered and there was an improvement in lung compliance.	3.2406597187940855
Both patients survived this critical situation.	3.1319568216589313
We conclude that treatment with exogenous surfactant in postburn victims with ARDS is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the survival rate of these high-risk patients.	3.643886434330762
The main aesthetic concern of patients with Angle class II deformities with skeletal deep bite - short face syndrome - is the short lower face.	3.232310474992842
It is the orthodontist's task to correct this deformity insofar as possible.	2.6613222831984165
Depending on the extent, even orthodontists at the beginning of their training will recognize this.	3.2348134530745463
Since presurgical orthodontic treatment determines the kind and extent of the surgical procedure, the orthodontist has to plan the treatment in for individual case .	3.6136575272140217
It is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a concept of treatment for patients with class II deformities, skeletal deep bite, and a short lower face.	4.034271177131517
Presurgical orthodontic treatment and the surgical procedure to correct the deformity are discussed.	4.5297803825478855
The treatment results show that it is necessary to leave or to create a certain curve of Spee, depending on the extent of the deformity, to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of to function, aesthetics, and stability.	4.0339423783627755
It can be concluded that it is only possible to reach the preset treatment goals with an exact diagnosis and the knowledge of the necessary preparation in combination with the surgical procedure.	4.40254157515386
Adequate psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexual patients during the "real- life-test" is crucial for the outcome after sex reassignement surgery.	3.598302953575471
Necessary modifications are discussed along the concept of "transsexual defense" and the interrelation of identity and disordered gender identity.	3.2179269872782235
Usually therapeuts of transsexual patients, who decide over somatic sex reassignement, have to engage also in psychotherapy in a broad sense.	3.5800748993476375
Within the setting of the "administrative-psychotherapeutic split" the psychotherapist leaves the decision over admission to sex reassignement to a therapist specialised in gender identity disorders.	2.819788176588347
In this setting patients have more time to develop insight and have better chances to explore other options and find individual solutions with regard to irreversible sex reassignement surgery.	3.0674643691661694
During recent years in the German federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms.	3.087382628862425
The hospital sector - as an element of this system - has also been affected.	3.3822287699740134
Based on various legislation the financial framework has been reduced which has led to tendencies of economic limitation and rationalization.	3.094621214478015
From this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result.	3.315382244895371
Cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and dicharged to outpatient services despite unknown domestic follow-up care.	4.07743063148832
Mostly the elderly are affected.	3.895664602197021
Medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between SGB V and SGB XI.	3.3826925385683775
However, this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit payment (rehabilitation before nursing, priority of home, etc.).	2.5010621246519253
Right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors.	3.7459954157502007
Various medical, nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation.	3.96912141151816
In 1995 the Ethics Commission of the Medical University of Lübeck was asked to rule on whether a preimplantation diagnostic procedure (PID) could be performed on a husband and wife who were both carriers of the cystic fibrosis mutation  F508.	2.995819917116899
The couple had previously given birth to a child with cystic fibrosis and had twice terminated a pregnancy following prenatal screening.	3.076503043664703
Ethically, the performance of a PID was certainly warranted for this couple.	3.5149532915595607
The risk of violating §§8 Section 1 and/or 2 Section 1 ("totipotent cells shall not be removed for diagnostic purposes") of the Law for the Protection of Embryos (ESchG) was judged to be nonexistent in written statements from two expert witnesses (Prof. K.V.	3.0153639481605627
Hinrichsen and Prof. H.M. Beier, both embryologists).	2.9713955157603564
In the view of the Ethics Commission, only §1 Section 2 ("an ovum shall be fertilized only for the purpose of inducing pregnancy") of the ESchG currently prohibits PIDs.	3.533991446182058
In light of the social and biological arguments in favor of PIDs, however, the Ethics Commission questioned whether this section of the ESchG is still morally justifiable.	3.486114064919203
A 38 year old male patient with a coarctation of the aorta was successfully operated using an ascending aorta-abdominal aorta bypass (AAAAB).	3.220583884696643
The diagnosis of a severe postisthmic stenosis had been confirmed by aortography.	3.3002439951195424
Preoperatively the patient suffered from extreme hypertension and claudicatio intermittens.	3.5850535641657766
After prosthetic repair of coarctation, blood pressure became normotensive and claudicatio intermittens disappeared.	3.2454715295035315
In this report, we discuss various surgical techniques and the most important question concerning the optimal timing of surgical repair of aortic coarctation.	4.047167155399416
We report on eleven prospectivly recorded patients treated between 1994 and 1998.	2.8994100670365692
In seven cases the colonoscopy had been done for diagnostic and in four cases for therapeutic reason.	3.2043253462211316
Nine women and two men (age range 56 to 92 years) were affected.	3.7323105180569303
In 77 % the perforation was found in the sigmoid colon.	3.802447591249539
All patients were operated on and five sutures, five resections and one colostomy were performed.	3.009784080298121
No significant differences could be shown in six patients with classical perforation compared with five patients presenting with prolonged abdominal pain.	3.637972189290576
Only duration of symptoms was significantly different in the two groups.	3.5649733603972025
Three patients (85, 90 and 92 years) died from late complications.	3.21436491628911
Indications of MR arthrography were analyzed in this prospective study.	3.914383143921673
The aim was to evaluate possible advantages over conventional MRI, establish diagnostic criteria and to analyze its meaning further for the therapeutic management of postoperative patients.	3.828089868638876
Nerve fibre-neuroendocrine cell complexes (NF-NEC-C's) are neuroendocrine cells located in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract directly connected with nerve fibres of Meissner's plexus.	2.9263819871598735
We report on a patient with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with electron microscopically demonstrated multiple NF-NEC-C's in non-antral gastric mucosa.	2.4351300275086034
It is suspected that in ZES the hypergastrinaemia may represent a trophic stimulus for the proliferation of NF-NEC-C's in the gastric mucosa.	2.7499741830173994
Introduction: The prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation, is especially in multi-system-trauma cases, recognized to be the "gold standard".	3.5320472002363283
Thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general, the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation, is becoming of increasing importance.	4.2998150294864805
Thereby we must take into consideration the limited possabilities, which are afflicted with a high degree of uncertainess, which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation.	3.641942701585093
The purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients, was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings, to identify areas for procedural optimization.	3.568596588337902
Staging of any tumor, i.e.	2.91657671019863
determination of the extent of the disease, serves to select the patients who might profit from curative surgical intervention or to define those patients with inoperable carcinomas who should be referred for other therapies, such as chemotherapy or irradiation.	4.104850055545841
Furthermore, accurate staging is necessary for assessment of prognosis, for radiation therapy planning, and for differentiation of those with small-cell lung cancer or for follow-up examinations of small-cell lung cancer patients after during and after chemotherapy.	3.7821074540806463
The primary radiological staging and diagnostic modalities for assessment of bronchial carcinomas are computed tomography (CT) of the thorax including liver and adrenal glands, abdominal sonography, and bone scintigraphy.	3.5314188346484126
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for specific indications, e.g.	2.653683758538223
infiltration of the chest wall or staging of patients with intolerance/allergy to intravenous contrast medium.	4.6161802234443625
The clinical value of nuclear medicine techniques, such as [18F]2-fluoride-2-desoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for evaluation of lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111 octreotide/somatostatin receptor scans for staging of small-cell lung cancer, and thallium-201 SPECT are currently being assessed in numerous studies, although these techniques are already in routine use.	3.54955679853826
In future these or nuclear medicine techniques, as well as techniques using molecular-based contrast material, especially for MR imaging, currently in experimental status, may yield serious potential for staging purposes.	3.4802385080685063
Background: We investigated fundus autofluorescence in vivo using a novel scanning laser ophthalmoscope.	3.0267618946240056
Myocardial infarctions may be precipitated by external triggers.	3.152655131561597
Changes in the environment also play an important role in the incidence of myocardial infarctions; circadian, seasonal, and weekly variations have been observed.	3.1780831607297433
Patients' behavior at the onset of symptoms depends on various factors and influences outcome and mortality.	3.3637596371158227
Appropriate preventive measures are indicated in order to protect patients during vulnerable periods.	4.522799203242573
Health education should be directed towards patients' behavior and promptly seeking medical assistance at the onset of symptoms.	3.0322956291489422
For these patients the absence of bone lesions is mandatory.	3.742237673844425
A patient suffering from long-standing pustular psoriasis of the palms was treated for 3 weeks with a mercury-containing drug.	3.554213739788208
Exacerbation into generalized pustular psoriasis developed.	3.3914060572409057
Mercury levels in blood and urine were increased.	3.80884356237145
After withdrawal of the mercury preparation, therapy with DMPA (2,3-Dimercapto-1-propane-sulfonic acid), a mercury antidote, was initiated, together with short-term treatment with aromatic retinoids and PUVA.	3.6438263207719217
Within a few days mercury levels decreased significantly and the skin lesions practically disappeared.	3.5046842291842286
Based on the results of chromosome analysis from cell cultures and testis biopsies, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in infertile men is up to 20%.	3.507412671359888
Chromosomal analysis from peripheral blood cultures is a routine procedure while the analysis of meiotic chromosomes is labor intensive and mainly used in a scientific setting.	3.420177452210637
Of all infertile males, 7-9% show numerical and/or structural chromosomal abnormalities in their peripheral blood lymphocytes.	3.5137571355295956
There is an inverse correlation between sperm count and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, with 21% of patients with non-obstructive azoospermia having a chromosomal abnormality, most often Klinefelter's syndrome.	3.432396666091902
The rate of patients with chromosomal abnormalities is only 9% in patients with severe oligozoospermia (less than 5 million/ml), and structural abnormalities are found more often in this group.	4.540756237303821
Using fluorescence in situ analysis the number of selected chromosomes can be assayed in single sperm cells.	3.1766514703577706
There is no consensus on whether infertile men have a higher proportion of aneuploid (disomic) sperm cells than fertile men.	2.823677561382297
Taking into account the results from meiotic studies in infertile men, an increased rate of aneuploid sperm cells is likely.	3.233847668366257
Chromosomal analysis should be performed on all infertile men being treated with ICSI as the result of this analysis could have important consequences in their reproductive decisions.	3.694078079671869
Background: Tufted angioma represents a benign vascular lesion of the skin.	3.6347655394245253
The knowledge of this distinctive entity is important in distinction of clinically more aggressive and malignant neoplasms respectively.	3.127684685038049
Limb lengthening in dwarfism has become a standardised procedure with a good prognosis.	3.4128538660055496
In most cases external fixation is used.	3.2057418207295476
Gain of leg length up to 15 cm and more is possible in the lower leg and the femur and 8.5 cm in the humerus.	4.01905748687174
Limb lengthening is useful in many cases of dwarfism due to skeletal dysplasia.	3.3868851502025863
There are a number of risks and possible complications involved and the procedure also requires considerable time.	3.515891987154209
We report the results of 48 patients with dwarfism operated on in the Orthopädische Kinderklinik Aschau (Orthopaedic Hospital for Children).	3.0592726578749283
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, prizing, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapy.	1.7065052471916973
A research-informed treatment (Grawe 1997), its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	2.2281330210580412
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by a specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	1.7315462000446715
The first part of this review provides an overview of Process-Experiential therapy, including theoretical foundation, that is, emotion theory, dialectical constructivism, and task analytic process orientation, and the basic treatment principles.	3.2505069412170515
Malnutrition is a common finding amongst our elders.	4.24766344450739
The causes of malnutrition are multifactorial and although they have been extensively studied, they are not entirely understood.	3.437272814781505
Both physiological and pathological processes of aging put this population at a higher risk of being undernourished.	3.384939685690585
These may be related to social, financial, psychological and/or physiological changes directly or indirectly associated to growing old.	3.533965466813653
We report on a 76-year-old female patient with clinical findings consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema.	2.843323366637778
Plasma glucagon levels were slightly elevated, but advanced radiologic techniques revealed no evidence of an underlying pancreatic tumour.	3.140182765220833
The dermatosis responded excellently to oral therapy with dapsone.	3.2823253017516536
The possible aetiology and pathogenesis of the "pseudoglucagonoma syndrome" are discussed.	3.0991651213609415
Complications during cataract surgery such as dropped nucleus or lens fragment dislocation into the vitreous cavity may become sight threatening.	2.8329840681335448
The recommendations regarding possible therapeutic approaches are inconsistent.	3.5109855032240533
Several factors like uveitis and/or an increased intraocular pressure play a major role in the decision on the further surgical procedure.	3.823067147746884
Recent publications recommend an early pars plana approach in order to avoid any traction at the peripheral retina during manipulations via a limbal approach.	3.1175537739634938
The authors describe the histopathology of the resting cartilage and the growth plate in a case of diastrophic dysplasia and review the differential diagnosis with pseudodiastrophic dysplasia and atelosteogenesis type II.	3.3346701089644353
Objective: Hypoplastic left heart (HLH) is a complex developmental malformation of the left ventricle, aorta, and associated valves.	4.129754706383639
Survival beyond neonatal period is the exception in untreated infants.	3.298744526891503
The prognosis, however, is no longer hopeless.	4.4579546754165165
Clinical stabilization of a neonate with HLH is appropriate until a management decision, based on appropriate parental counselling, can be made.	3.5477591483341295
Forty-one patients demonstrating clinical symptoms for cerebral infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI).	3.2405932737666427
In 8 patients only DWI showed the cerebral lesions clearly.	3.0091873932821254
One patient with positive DWI and T2WI suffered from HSV encephalitis.	2.7382672653852294
DWI is superior to T2WI in assessment of small cortical infarcts and cerebral infarction in patients with preexisting vascular lesions.	3.8460975993442714
DWI is not specific, so other causes like cerebral hematoma and encephalitis have to be considered.	3.017480063898989
Juvenile polyposis was first described by Cronkhite and Canada in 1955.	3.4121901298255994
This disease is characterized by juvenile intestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities.	3.5786883776369054
The etiology of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS), however, is still not well understood.	3.496543617261425
Interestingly, among patients with CCS a significant correlation (16.5 %) with intestinal carcinomas has been observed.	3.066501843803773
Thus, malignant transformation and/or genetic predisposition may be involved in the initiation of the disease.	4.297664680247895
In the following, epidemiology, symptoms, morphology and therapy of CCS are discussed.	3.0661669033311694
Our examinations are based on studies reported in the literature and on a case report of a female patient who developed a colon carcinoma 2 years after initial diagnosis of CCS.	4.792567933001978
Pacemaker erythema is a rare, irreversible side effect of cardiac pacemakers, clinically characterized by epifocal teleangiectatic erythema.	3.736023722046955
Histology reveals teleangiectatic vessels in the superficial dermis and a slight perivascular infiltrate.	3.161452780898776
We report on three patients presenting with pacemaker erythema following either pacemaker or defibrillator implantation.	2.833130969201844
The pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown.	2.718275059586478
In contrast to peri- or postoperative pacemaker infections, physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism.	3.174181557189834
Allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results.	3.247827681790456
The present legal requirements for the prescription of controlled drugs remains an impediment to adequate therapy for chronic pain because of an abundance of legal regulations.	3.1482956246797924
The physician prescribing opioids must consider the permitted maximum amount per prescription, the period of time the drug is prescribed for, numerous cross references, and other special regulations, and he still cannot be sure that he does not violate certain legal requirements.	2.907770428683714
Often these difficulties result in withholding necessary pain treatment!	3.3265001114142265
In the authors' opinion it should be sufficient to write a specific prescription form for controlled drugs in the same way as any other ordinary prescription without jeopardizing the safety of the drug control system.	3.215132497924308
It is important that the use of the narcotic be justified in the sense of § 13 Abs.	3.528310070562698
1 of the drug control regulation, as judged by the responsible prescriber of the drug, and that any offence be punished.	4.039085225577318
The use of triplicate prescriptions guarantees sufficient proof.	2.7193839776706534
Legislation is requested that will substitute for the present drug control regulations, which are difficult to handle.	4.121846632921863
The aim of the study was to investigate the ability to activate the quadriceps femoris muscle voluntarily in patients after severe knee injuries and it's influence on muscle function.	2.870907128724539
33 male patients after ACL-rupture with concomitant injuries were investigated with a twitch-interpolation-method to determine the maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and the ability to activate the quadriceps muscle voluntarily.	3.6095244572233844
Managed care, i.e., the integration of health insurance and delivery of care under the direction of one organization, is gaining importance in the USA health market.	3.5988010311411593
Given the shrinking public resources in Germany, managed care seems attractive for the German health system, too.	3.131849571193909
In this review the development of managed care, the principal elements, forms of organisation and practical tools are outlined.	3.462300791726091
The regulation of the delivery of care by means of controlling and financial incentives threatens the autonomy of physicians: the physician must act as a "double agent", caring for the interest for the individual patient and being restricted by the contract with the managed care organisation.	3.3583347782153146
Cost containment by managed care was achieved by reducing the fees for physicians and hospitals (and partly by restricting care for patients).	3.4245911108182487
Only a fraction of this cost reduction was handed over to the enrollee or employer, and most of the money was returned with profit to the shareholders of the managed care organisations.	2.9895584941787012
The preeminent role of primary care physicians as gatekeepers of the health network led to a reduced demand for specialist services in general and for university hospitals and anesthesiologists in particular.	3.462422486654798
The paradigm of managed care, i.e., to guide the patient and the care giver through the health care system in order to achieve cost-effective and high quality care, seems very attractive.	3.8415976529734657
The stress on cost minimization by any means in the daily practice of managed care makes it doubtful if managed care should be an option for the German health system, in particular because there are a number of restrictions on it in German law.	3.5637899856004354
Background: Analysis of the impact of head fractures, intracranial hemorrhages, brain edema, and prognostic risk factors on long-term outcome in children with severe head injury.	3.686522451916027
Background: In the past, the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect.	3.9325027652300792
Since the target tissue is not directly observable, no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon.	3.515880484360709
High inter- and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under- or overdosage.	3.2980808112296525
Underdosage is therapeutically useless, while overdosage causes the so-called "popeffects" which may induce severe damage to the eye.	3.49213381416896
In the past, most scientific or routine studies on heart rate variability (HRV) were done using commercial Holter ECG devices with traditional magnetic tapes.	2.68543099330813
All methods to calculate parameters of HRV are based on the measurement of time intervals between successive sinus cardiac beats, in practice RR intervals.	3.6542645741271333
Hence, results of HRV calculation depend on the quality of primary data acquisition.	4.0934054695793325
However, technical standards on accuracy of RR interval acquisition in magnetic tape and digital solid state Holter ECG systems do not exist as yet.	2.9953151653975087
Therefore in a laboratory investigation accuracy of HRV parameter calculation after traditional standard tape with and without real-time analysis and digital solid state data acquisition was compared in three commercial Holter ECG systems [Ela medical (E), Oxford Medilog Excel (O) and Medset Cardiolight (M)].	2.860654737570116
A computer-based ECG simulator was used to synthesize a test signal consisting of artificial P-QRS complexes of fixed rate, quartz stabilized "sinus rhythms".	3.0011447836755383
Two channel analog tape and digital 24h recordings of the fixed rate test signal were performed simultaneously.	3.0297637836321
The influence of recording technology on accuracy of RR interval measurement and consequently on time domaine HRV was shown by comparing five standard 24-h time domain parameters.	2.7015055750546084
As expected, in the three Holter systems the analog tape recordings showed a higher, technically induced, artificial RR variability.	3.7514717026894133
The SDNN values (E: 9.38ms vs 2.68ms; p<0.001; O: 3.89ms vs 0.97ms; p<0.001; M: 10.47ms vs 2.89ms; p=0.001), SDNN-Index values (E: 8.22ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; O: 3.75ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; M: 7.81ms vs 1.49ms, p<0.001) and RMSSD-values (E: 10.39ms vs 2.16ms; p<0.001; O: 10.05ms vs 1.88ms, p<0.001; M: 8.62ms vs 1.69ms; p<0.001) were significantly lower if acquisition was done by digital solid devices in all systems, SDANN (M: 9.83ms vs 5.37ms; p<0.001) in the Medset system too.	3.007963834849706
The used method is a possible way to validate commercial Holter ECG systems for HRV analysis.	3.4513965096203645
Clinical significance of artifical HRV seems to be low.	3.7136048054279263
Even today, when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is done, the incidence of this rare disease remains the same.	3.8386871948788683
History, clinical and X-ray findings are non-specific.	3.6066207902426437
Aerobilia was seen in 17 % of the patients.	4.74835157704548
Since 1992 sonography has proveded an exact diagnosis in 10 of 15 cases.	3.6659770445508215
In the triad of known gallstone, non-specific epigastric pain with assumed small intestinal obstruction, and impossible detection of a stone in the gallbladder, there is strong suspicion of a gallstone ileus.	3.7285994329682053
Intraoperatively more than one stone was found in the intestines in 20 %, and cholecystoduodenal fistulas were encountered in 83 %.	4.005328464109243
There has been no significant change in mortality for 30 years.	3.3139315882886975
Autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the microtopographic anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of microneurosurgical techniques.	3.132851429707644
Recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions.	3.8434242477469214
However, attempts to restore forearm, hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far.	3.1456780234981685
Therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making, selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and longlasting postoperative management.	3.0363089474638785
Leg venectasia is a common problem.	3.644286027607276
Although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities, none of them gives satisfactory results.	3.2538247296644007
The effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor.	3.6117471527077503
Electrocoagulation and argon laser treatment often result in scarring.	3.3244534963652415
We studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of 585 nm in the treatment of leg venectasia.	3.1547640700117396
After repeated treatments using this laser system, only 30% of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed; we obtained better lightening of smaller red, telangiectatic vessels with a diameter up to 0.4 mm.	3.217679724999955
However, hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment.	3.0579651437869577
In post-treatment biopsies, occlusion of the vessels was found.	3.666562385932807
Based on these results, we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia.	3.6380606538964066
Larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy, while finer telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	3.3641811674813757
Total hip replacement is often recommended for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	2.9227138315016457
A less invasive approach with shorter operating time is the replacement of the femoral head only, leaving the acetabular cartilage in situ.	3.812561198400775
Hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using a metallic head prosthesis was not successful in the past, because the majority of patients developed protrusio acetabuli after surgery.	4.2205628962682535
In the present study hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head was shown to be a useful method for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	2.8441896210869184
From 1985 to 1990 277 patients were treated with hemiarthroplasty.	3.647630562979666
The average age at the time of accident and operation was 81.7 years.	3.288325639792117
At the time of follow-up in 1993 only 77 survivors were available for examination.	3.440824684081858
A standardized score was calculated assessing activity, gait, hip pain, etc., with the patients obtaining an average score of 58 out of a possible 78 points.	3.9265069033650972
Only three patients had hip pain, and in four cases the roentgenographic examination revealed protrusio acetabuli.	4.162163779279989
Two of these four patients underwent revision surgery for replacement of the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	2.764759621632898
In view of the small number of approach-related complications, hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head is the recommended surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	2.7393746329507684
In the rare patient with protrusio acetabuli, revision surgery can be performed to replace the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	3.093542872675767
Functional relaxation (FE), a somato-psychotherapeutic method, can reduce asthmatic symptoms.	3.4441617462871497
The efficiency of a 5 minute introduction of elements of functional relaxation (EFE) is compared with a placebo-relaxation-method not based on the hypothetical mechanisms of FE, and a standardised pharmacological bronchodilative test using salbutamol.	3.6238230360032637
In a controlled prospective randomised single blind setting 18 children and adolescents with acute asthma were treated on three consecutive days with each method.	3.030908387785933
Before and ten minutes after therapy the patients had bodyplethysmographic pulmonary function testing.	3.536800884702424
U-Tests showed that the baseline measurements were comparable.	3.781699718829615
The before-after-comparison revealed significant changes for EFE and salbutamol, not for the placebo-relaxation.	3.00369354898324
There were significant differences between the intraindividual differences of the airway resistance and the specific airway resistance between salbutamol and the placebo-relaxation, not between EFE and salbutamol or EFE and the placebo-relaxation.	3.036106037721133
FE can be an effective complementary treatment in children or adolescents with asthma.	3.7114205277875856
The following three case studies will prove, that the sonographic diagnosis of a fatty liver is often related to a metabolic disease, beginning at the age of 4 to 5 years in conjunction with the Morbus Wilson.	3.9014669945963845
3D Ultrasound will find in the next years a wide popularity under the medical imaging applications.	3.3370081533452898
The method expands the well-known sonography on the third dimension, therefore it becomes possible to generate  spatial 3D views of internal organs.	3.0767590699338188
It is further possible to display static (3D) as well as  dynamic organs (4D, e.g.	3.1445242839060836
The clarity of the three-dimensional presentation supports very effectively the navigation.	4.01420391726281
58 patients following Gustilo IIIB open tibial fractures, treated by serial debridements, osteosynthesis and microvascular free tissue transfer were investigated after an average of 6 years.	3.3020549007623003
Assessment of life satisfaction was done by means of a proven valid and reliable test instrument (FLZ - "Fragen zur Lebenszufriedenheit").	3.3659960176570287
Further specific questions on treatment satisfaction, aesthetic result, occupation and income were added to this questionnaire.	3.010821990398033
Significant discrepancies of the items recreational activities, income, occupation and partnership, productivity, mobility and pain were evaluated in comparison to available data of healthy west german population.	3.2111883814983377
The calculated global index of life satisfaction and health differed significantly from the established index of west german population.	2.9055988678620235
Although specific aspects like aesthetic result, donor site morbidity, pain and even function were critically judged, 91 % of the patients were satisfied with the long term result of the treatment.	4.217405877099547
None of the patients thought that an initial amputation probably might have been a better solution.	3.6114720398125613
The postrehabilitation employment rate was 64 %.	3.350451897352543
Limb salvage of Gustilo IIIB fractures by means of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol is able to afford useful and satisfying long time results.	3.3580149989243733
However, an impairment of quality of life, at least in specific items has to be considered.	3.4087155828891444
The case of a 10-year-old boy with post-traumatic priapism after perineal trauma is presented.	3.382869075019675
Interdisciplinary treatment using angiography and selective catheter embolization for juvenile high-flow priapism is demonstrated.	3.286054666531854
The literature and the diagnostic possibilities resulting from color duplex sonography are discussed.	3.4368278922011783
Only 53%-58% of patients with a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAB) following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm survive without neurological damage.	3.5406193843169396
Morbidity and mortality are closely related to the delayed ischaemic neurological deficit due to cerebral vasospasm.	3.0445686588848977
The following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms; the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists, hypervolaemic haemodilution, and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature.	3.4712271064523272
During the last decade an unusual amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis has been described in association with autoimmune disease in sixteen female patients.	3.2134095523850483
The clinical hallmark is a sterile pustular dermatosis preferentially located in intertriginous regions that responds to local or systemic corticosteroids.	2.8206655818109825
Histologic features are subcorneal sometimes spongiform neutrophilic pustules.	2.9918589615322673
We report an additional patient suffering from this unusual dermatosis.	3.28140575211299
An overview of the patients described to date and a review of the literature are given in an attempt to delineate this amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis from the known pustular dermatoses.	3.504401577843411
The area "Environment and Health" is characterized by interdisciplinary features and, consequently, an intense need for communication.	3.2429451323197744
In addition it has to be considered that sometimes there are difficulties in terms of information search.	3.810703619543329
A comparison of national problem solving strategies concerning electronic network activities within this area led to the development project for a European information and communication platform.	3.1073411117588186
By this electronic platform the international exchange of experiences, coordination of activities, harmonization efforts and an optimization of qualification possibilities for environmental health professionals will become easier.	2.742582362415199
Objectives Intertrochanteric adduction osteotomy to delay or prevent the development of a coxofemoral osteoarthritis.	3.5476000009337314
No removal of bony wedge thus avoiding leg shortening.	3.232425330809581
The aim of this study was to analyze the localization and distribution of extracellular matrix in normal and glaucomatous damaged optic discs using immunohistochemical methods.	2.7923445077908773
Five eyes donated for corneal allografting without any history of glaucoma and three other eyes with secondary glaucoma were studied.	2.8050931025034043
Immunohistochemical reactions were performed with antibodies against collagen types I, III, IV and VI and against laminin, proliferating antigen KI 67 and GFAP.	3.219726423755551
In glaucomatous eyes the characteristic arrangement of collagen fibrils is lacking.	3.121766798640079
Septa of the lamina cribrosa appear enlarged.	3.704862377022011
The immunoreactivity of all examined collagen types is stronger in glaucomatous eyes.	3.1139013622271636
The axon basement membranes show an irregular and interrupted pattern.	3.0366690320949083
The number of proliferating cells with positive GFAP staining in glaucomatous cribriform plates is distinctly higher.	2.7593998909252573
We postulate that fibroblasts and astrocytes in the stroma of glaucomatous lamina cribrosa could be stimulated to increased and uncontrolled proliferation.	2.7788735505127136
Associated disorganization and raised secretion of extracellular matrix may lead to axon constriction and, secondarily, to neural degeneration.	3.2374335723930603
Concomitant pathologies (labral lesions, intra-/extra-osseous ganglia and stress bone marrow edema) in adult residual hip dysplasia (RHD) might influence the outcome of conservative hip surgery.	3.223217312492174
The aim of our prospective clinical study was to assess the value of preoperative MR arthrography in diagnosing concomitant lesions and in making surgical decisions in RHD.	3.3383489083629887
The first 37 consecutive patients with a minimum follow-up of 18 months have been analysed.	4.2992476592308
All 37 patients presented RHD with the clinical symptomatology of labral lesions and underwent routine preoperative MRA.	3.293551029581421
According to clinical, radiological and MR arthrographical criteria, these 37 patients were subdivided into four therapeutic subgroups: (1) reorientation of the acetabulum using the Tönnis triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO); (2) intertrochanteric varisation osteotomy (IVO); (3) palliative decompression with only symptomatic partial resection of the torn labrum (PALL); (4) primary total hip replacement (TEP).	3.456587652670709
Based on the preliminary clinical and radiological outcomes of these four subgroups, the following conclusions can be drawn: labral lesions are considered to be a sign of chronic joint instability.	3.4299125458750797
Therefore, acetabular malorientation should be corrected by redirectional osteotomy of the acetabulum (TPO-subgroup) even in low grades of RHD if labral lesions are present.	2.9790439280336334
"Palliative" labral resections without corrective osteotomy (PALL subgroup) in secondary osteoarthritis due to RHD are definitively obsolete, because they rapidly progress to severe osteoarthritis due to surgically accelerated joint instability.	2.8895612780434563
In RHD with highly osteoarthritic hip joints and concomitant lesions, one should not hesitate to perform primary THR even in young patients.	3.1054932728462945
Severe infections of the talus are often associated with complete septic collapse of the talus.	3.8068184097699174
In the Department of Traumatology, Braunschweig, in 1995 three patients (all male, average age 35.3 +/- 10.2 years) were treated with cancellous bone grafting after talectomy performed because of infection and complete septic collapse of the talus.	3.0694335520713416
In two of these cases third-degree open total dislocation of the talus had been sustained.	4.032216138949525
The third patient came to us after undergoing arthroscopy of the ankle region in another hospital.	3.2217324690332245
In each case a fulminating infection was the outcome.	3.2529138478976334
Following a step-by-step algorithm, in a first step urgent radical debridement with talectomy was done.	3.127077748492802
To maintain approximation between the tibia and calcaneus on one side and the os naviculare on the other, the bony defect was filled with PMMA chains and the external fixateur technique was used for immobilization during treatment of the infection.	3.4381190451053625
After second- and third-look procedures a free flap was grown for soft tissue coverage within the first 10 days.	3.467926180185642
After 17.6 +/- 3.3 days the talus was replaced with a cancellous bone graft, combined with double arthrodesis in two cases, and external fixation for the next 4-5 weeks.	3.9804984708969786
In the third patient a triple arthrodesis was done.	3.1436668025061363
At follow-up after an average of 12 months (range 8-17 months), the bone graft with arthrodesis had been completely integrated in all cases.	4.409199715379543
All patients are free of symptoms in normal life.	3.6693491963255687
In the case of severe open fractures of the talus with significant comminution combined with infection and septic bone collapse conservation of the talus is often impossible.	3.4905424403396523
Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a 63 year old female in Austria.	3.8976761107504148
Sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia, disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment.	3.0487084196220993
Being a farmer, the patient belongs to a recognized high-risk-group, as most other infected people do.	4.067857906120736
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a human infection by Streptococcus suis in Austria so far.	3.13219612722379
The results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis, and thus, are in contrast to the guinea-pig-model by Kay, who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss.	3.3885755495234564
The present knowledge of Streptococcus suis meningitis with respect to neurophysiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and increasing resistance against antibiotics is discussed.	3.2016994940864945
The introduction of atypical antipsychotics has presented new options for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenic patients.	3.0403970255402246
It is assumed that in the near future, neuroleptic medication will shift from conventional to atypical antipsychotics for an increasing number of patients.	3.114935744849822
The present article addresses guidelines for the conversion from conventional to atypical neuroleptics in inpatient and outpatient settings.	2.9959229416785953
Numerous epidemiological studies about multiple trauma patients do not include an analysis of patients under the age of 18.	4.69538733550137
To study this, the data of 682 patients with multiple traumata, treated between 1981 and 1991 at Hannover Medical School, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed.	3.88684477528163
The patients were divided into four age-related groups: preschool age (< 6 years), school age (< 13 years), teenagers (< 18 years) and adults (L 18 years).	3.738427066741558
Analyzed were the cause of trauma, localization of injuries and the cause of death.	4.339255992398464
Children were less often injured as passengers in cars, but more often injured as pedestrians and bicyclists than adults.	3.081518101763994
However, children showed a significant higher mortality than adults, with threefold increased risk of death when they injured as passengers in car accidents.	3.5546500548519053
In all groups injuries to the head and the legs were most common.	3.975006859707675
Children showed a lower incidence of trauma to the thorax, abdomen, hip and arms than the adult group.	2.9796900296019357
Nevertheless, trauma to the thorax, abdomen and head was associated with the highest risk of death in all groups.	3.870009065520723
Spinal cord injuries, especially injuries to the neck, also showed a high risk of death.	4.595237797059163
Children younger than 6 years had the most severe head injuries.	4.190867445518801
Safety improvements for children in cars, helmet usage on bicycles and early training in traffic safety for children might decrease the lethality in this group of trauma patients.	3.2599399644888423
During the past 7 years 45 patients have been operated upon using the Childs-Phillips method.	3.1628990424709804
Of those, 37 were subsequently examined for the study - 7 patients had died in the meantime.	3.8789118412088617
None of the deaths occurred as a direct result of transmesenteric small-bowel plication.	3.149572732450381
During the most recent examinations 86.5 % of those patients checked had (virtually) no complaints - 91.9 % based upon the Visick classification.	3.112890366360442
A subtotal intestinal obstruction occurred during the period of the study in 8.1 % of cases, but could be conservatively treated.	4.539794646428679
Up until the most recent examination there were still no instances of a late recurrence.	3.444922097183886
Most intestinal obstruction recurrences are due to errors specific to the technique and are early recurrences.	3.491317445490336
On the basis of our results, we are of the opinion that plication in the presence of existing peritonitis, as well as partial plication, is acceptable.	4.042523236656727
To prospectively survey skin lesions in a large group of newborns, as no such study has as yet been performed in Germany.	3.386016926628977
We present the case of a 35-year-old patient suffering from schizoaffective psychosis.	2.9795180814252515
After 4 weeks on clozapine he developed acute priapism.	2.8716023851756063
Delay of urgent urologic treatment incrases the risk of irreversible impotence.	3.7359901558689796
The patient's history should be evaluated with respect to former unphysiological prolonged erections.	3.8545515892263325
The further development of 162 stroke patients (average age 77 years), who were geriatrically assessed during hospitalization, was evaluated ca.	3.734653681472615
Questionnaires were mailed to patients.	3.0645818850787485
53% of the patients (n = 86) returned the questionnaire duly filled in; 20% (n = 32) had died; in the remaining 27% of cases (n = 44) no information was obtained on further development.	3.985746838332824
80% of those patients who responded lived at home despite numerous medical problems.	3.3905430603392555
Family members assumed most of the care required.	3.897125032000818
Follow-up treatment and pain therapy proved to be particularly problematic.	3.791050794757755
The Barthel Index according to data collected was significantly lower compared to figures noted upon release from the hospital.	3.2425651540929414
Hardly anyone among those patients received follow-up treatment.	4.450442100627512
74% of patients complained of pain although the majority has regular contacts with the family doctor.	3.2343172740757975
For those patients who died in the 18 months interval, significantly lower values for the activities of daily living (ADL) has already been recorded upon hospitalization.	3.6147311246065637
They had a less favorable view of their state of health and were less satisfied with life in general.	3.4351750310060134
The routine staging work-up for renal cancer includes a contrast-enhanced multiphasic spiral CT and a chest radiograph.	3.596804411978487
If there is doubt regarding the presence and extent of (supradiaphragmatic) IVC thrombus, MR imaging should be performed.	3.116285301336095
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging should be used in place of CT in any patient with severe renal dysfunction, symptomatic polycystic kidney disease, or a history of allergy to iodinated contrast media.	3.844716505113109
Cavography is no longer needed in the era of (adaptive array detector) spiral CT and MR venography.	3.769381997667086
Patients: We report on four infants with nonketotic hyperglycinemia, three with a neonatal form and one with the milder infantile form.	3.486292104681917
The serum concentrations of glycine decreased following sodium benzoate treatment but cerebrospinal fluid/serum glycine ratio remained elevated with no improvement in clinical outcome.	2.8124971864890647
The patient with the infantile form has been treated for over three years with dextromethorphan, and is now a severely retarded child without seizure activity and continuous psychomotor development.	3.414588117106513
Immunosuppression-related Candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators, notably tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN).	3.2635862889130345
Important but unappreciated differences in the immunopathophysiology of fungal vs. bacterial infections make such cytokine priming appear contrary to current strategies for reducing cytokine-mediated organ injury and mortality due to gram-negative bacteremia and endotoxemia.	2.849869320960675
Optimistically, preclinical studies to date have found that the coadministration of such immunoadjuvants does not compromise, and actually may improve, the efficacy of synthetic antifungals.	3.410383233883941
Such combination therapies should continue to be evaluated in animal models of Candida infection which otherwise progress to lethal shock or chronic disseminated disease despite aggressive use of existing antifungal agents.	3.059394144779687
Bilateral neck exploration is the standard procedure in primary hyperparathyroidism.	4.00009191685171
A localized single gland disease is the basis for a minimally invasive procedure.	4.1590365434816725
Therefore preoperative localization techniques play an important role in planning (minimally invasive) first time exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism.	3.0218956817204847
The combination of 99 mTc-SestaMIBI scintigraphy with ultrasound allows correct localization of the parathyroid adenoma in 86 % of all single gland diseases.	2.9431055365513883
Multiple gland disease could be predicted in isolated cases only.	3.168989775643739
Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging could not improve the results.	3.9971203092662306
Surgery for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism should only be performed after positive localization studies.	3.4181376882478944
Prehospital thrombolysis is often recommended for patients in whom a major time gain of >90 min compared to in-hospital therapy is expected.	3.65734507677698
It has been repeatedly shown by metropolitan rescue services that very early presentation after onset of symptoms in a high percentage of patients offers an additional chance for optimizing thrombolytic therapy.	3.097014945665337
More than half of all patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction to the EMS may be treated within 90 min after symptom onset, enabling preservation of major myocardial areas at risk.	3.9541186318236483
Thus, prehospital thrombolysis in metropolitan areas offers a chance to take advantage of an ideal time window, without additional risk.	3.15551357681811
Moreover, technical and diagnostic preconditions are easily fulfilled.	3.138013513076599
Low resection and intersphincteric extirpation of rectal cancer in the distal third of the rectum has become an accepted sphincter-saving method.	3.753398366260686
From December 1990 to December 1994, 42 patients (17 women and 25 men) with a mean age of 67.2 years had a low resection or extirpation of the rectum at our institution.	3.6937445429178806
Eighteen patients received a transanal sutured anastomosis, 24 a stapler anastomosis.	3.370265971675656
We had a lethality rate of 2.5 % and a anastomotic insufficiency rate of 14 %.	3.1872780529292317
"NoToX Histological Fixative" is a formaldehyde substitute for the fixation of tissues prior to histological investigation.	3.1174832341674863
Intraoperative samples and necropsy tissue were tested.	3.337666543099374
NoToX was substituted for formaldehyde in the fixation step, otherwise the same manufacturer-specified protocols were used for all reagents.	3.248716258872184
Conventional histological and accepted immunohistological investigations, especially for tumour diagnosis, were used.	3.644917064734941
In all tests, results with NoToX-fixated tissue were similar to those with tissue fixed with formaldehyde regarding both staining and diagnosis.	3.1603624194163755
NoToX is a useful substitute for formaldehyde.	3.9609389877776464
The aim of this article is to provide current information on morphological parameters useful for a forensic age estimation of human skin wounds.	2.796534812085244
In addition to mainly cellular reactions detectable by routine histological or enzyme histochemical techniques, immunohistochemical parameters and their forensic value are especially discussed.	2.702037117950966
A dynamic helical CT scan following initial ultrasound provides reliable radiological staging for kidney traumas and immediate diagnosis of most abdominal injuries.	2.941548670212646
It also proves useful for pediatric traumas.	3.2729987862361782
Using mainly CT data we apply a classification system proposed by the American Association for Surgery of Trauma (grade I-V).	3.099734632547043
The diagnostic steps and subsequent management are demonstrated by flow-chart.	3.2229608475115934
Most renal traumas may be treated conservatively but persistent bleeding or persistent urinary extravasation may necessitate surgical intervention.	3.2807236255128247
In cases of exploration of the kidney, the use of fibrin adhesive, alloplastic mesh capsule and DJ stents enables the reconstruction of the kidney.	3.5305806885192337
Exploration of the renal injury should never be omitted if urgent laparotomy is indicated for associated injuries.	3.3507577045547268
With worldwide over 1million applications, vascular closure devices have been established as an essential tool of invasive cardiology.	3.3438896600732093
This overview compares today's four commercially available closure devices, VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc. (PC) and DuettTM (DU) for their usefulness after coronary interventions.	2.61477194599612
The published data regarding deployment success rates for VS, AS, PC and DU are in the range of 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% up to 100%, respectively.	3.2120355104189695
Times to hemostasis were 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14', accompanied by times to mobilization of 6-9h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.	3.675684674932968
Minor complications were described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.	3.0673741088398594
Although none of the closure devices has been shown to reduce major local complications as compared to manual compression, all sealing devices have documented a significant reduction in time to hemostasis.	3.7198601712121406
The increased patient comfort is essentially related to the ability of sheath removal immediately after PTCA.	3.6852577713896526
Vascular closure devices reduce the burden of medical staff and decrease hospital costs by earlier discharge.	3.1761293650664104
Polyhydramnios occurs in 0.2 to 1.6 % of pregnancies.	3.503081767920648
It may be due to a number of congenital anomalies, an abnormal karyotype, maternal diabetes, Rh-disease or intrauterine infections potentially requiring non-invasive or invasive measures.	3.480973309365569
Treatment of polyhydramnios may focus on correction of the causative lesion, or symptomatic relief through drainage of amniotic fluid.	3.2171027155540632
Maternal administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors represents a further, non-invasive therapeutic option.	3.6398843760198827
Indomethacin, Sulindac, or Nimesulide reduce the fetal urine output thus decreasing amniotic fluid volume over time without the risks associated with invasive procedures.	2.982040661698821
However, potentially serious ductal constriction as well as a delay in the onset of amniotic fluid reduction have limited its application.	3.68651535749566
The hemodynamic characteristics of monochorionic pregnancies complicated by TTTS have led to the development of endoscopic laser coagulation of placental vascular anastomoses as a definitive treatment.	3.0829205588957653
Treatment is only required in a small minoritiy of pregnancies with polyhydramnios.	3.438928631043111
Mild cases can be managed expectatively.	4.102285647086015
Intrauterine pressure increases with an excessive increase in amniotic fluid volume (AFI > 400 mm or MVP > 150 mm) leads to the elevation of intrauterine pressure.	3.1951566243616583
Complications such as preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor may lead to premature delivery.	3.2413492935209947
The main goal of prenatal treatment of polyhydramnios is thus the improvement of fetal outcome through prolongation of gestation and/or the alleviation of maternal symptoms.	3.149463352549992
With the recent developments in computer technology and the improvements in modern neuroimaging, frame-based stereotactic guidance for open microsurgical procedures has been increasingly replaced by neuronavigation, also called frameless stereotaxy.	2.812029629537687
It allows transfer of individual patient's images onto the operative field to assist the neurosurgeon intraoperatively in defining the tumor margins or identifying functionally important brain areas.	2.984871735328958
The different localization techniques employed are articulated position-sensing arms, infrared or ultrasound systems working with the principle of satellite navigation and robotic systems integrated with the operating microscope.	2.922554569625593
In 200 operations performed with different systems (arm-based, robotic and infrared) the method proved to be helpful, enabling fewer invasive procedures to be performed.	3.4066566894246777
With a mean deviation of 2.87 +/- 1.9 mm for intraoperative localization, the accuracy was only slightly worse than in frame-based stereotaxy with deviations below 2 mm.	3.0438060586123132
Neuronavigation was most helpful for operations on deeply seated lesions, skull-base tumors and lesions in brain areas with high functionality.	3.2290920362491353
The major disadvantage is the use of preoperative data for navigation, leading to inaccuracies when anatomical structures are altered during the operation by resection of tumors or shift of intracranial soft tissue.	3.6992342668783675
Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be a solution for this problem.	3.242896325898533
With the method of intraoperative MRI developed in our department it has already been possible to update neuronavigation with images reflecting intraoperative changes in anatomy.	3.3329442562292977
Therefore, neuronavigation is definitely a method with growing importance in operative routine, and it will also spread into other surgical specialties.	3.156582970646623
Severe pain of mucositis induced by cytostatic conditioning therapy in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients generally requires continuous parenteral opioid treatment.	3.1854372130184085
Cognitive and psychological disturbances are frequent complications subsequent to BMT and may result from cerebral opioid side effects.	3.5588359905648375
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of continuous morphine in mucositis pain and the side-effects in BMT patients.	3.077193898010214
Particular emphasis was placed on the question of whether reaction times, which are usually measured to estimate opioid effects upon vigilance, are influenced by pain-induced cognitive impairments in pain patients.	3.644701786834319
Methods While in hospital, 10 BMT patients were examined daily with the aid of a mucositis scale, subjective visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and mood parameters, a German version of the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), and a mental performance task battery, and the morphine given was documented.	3.685395272378359
Mental performance tests were simple auditory reaction time and choice reaction time.	3.3453415326595017
Seven patients also performed a Sternberg memory search test in which they had to use 'yes' and 'no' response keys to match visually presented test letters to a previously memorized set of letters.	2.806572330231732
Practice and baseline data were collected within the first week before BMT.	3.999456178565092
Results The intensity and duration of mucositis differed from patient to patient, resulting in different pain intensities and MPQ scores.	3.4350184685139595
Prolongation of the choice reaction time averaged over the period of mucositis treatment correlated significantly with residual pain intensity (Spearman rs = 0.88, p < 0.01) but not with morphine dose (rs = 0.35, p = 0.33).	3.155891002854478
For the Sternberg memory search test greater correlation coefficients resulted between reaction time and morphine dose (rs = 0.86, p = 0.014) than between reaction time and residual pain intensity (rs = 0.61, p = 0.15).	2.604978146204522
In turn, pain intensity, unlike morphine dose, was significantly correlated with high scores in the mood parameters for depression, passivity, and tiredness.	3.304610189947807
Conclusions It is concluded that both pain and morphine can impair cognitive performance, but that these mental stressors seem to differ according to qualitative criteria.	3.1662341351696397
Whereas pain might slow reaction time by distracting a patient's attention, particularly in low mental demand tasks, morphine could interfere with more specific cognitive processes, such as short-term memory operations, that are required in more complex tasks.	3.398625146174221
The case of a 63-year-old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described.	3.2405242612621135
Histopathological and cytopathological examination of tissue from the retroperitoneal tumor led to a diagnosis of lymphoreticular neoplasia.	3.4836324593981347
The patient died in acute cardiac failure, five weeks after initial presentation.	3.1682142052782845
Autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium.	3.2941225572616895
Macroscopically, the bone marrow appeared normal.	4.010924343397953
The tumor cells were reactive for CD45, vimentin and chloroacetate esterase, but were unreactive with a broad spectrum of antibodies against myelomonocytic and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c-kit (CD117), characteristic markers for mast cells.	2.847106367548844
However, the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis.	3.4874597550388273
A diagnosis of bone marrow mastocytosis with an associated secondary extramedullary mast cell sarcoma was established.	3.0158083531456072
The cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic atrioseptal tumor nodule.	3.3063591212974863
Thrombembolic events as paraneoplastic complications in malignant disease account for severe morbidity and mortality in these patients.	3.355305336364691
In some cases disturbance in hemostasis is the first manifestation of a neoplastic process.	3.581722237030852
We report the cases of two patients with cerebral and extracerebral vessel occlusions, in whom epithelial tumors of low malignant potential (borderline-tumors) of ovar and peritoneum were diagnosed later on.	3.3943459360246706
The second patient died a few days after the first symptoms with devastating multiple vessel occlusion.	3.6781435117802013
In stroke of unknown aetiology a paraneoplastic process should be kept in mind.	3.03779543123076
The diagnosis is more probable with recurrent thrombembolism in different body regions and when warfarin therapie was ineffective.	2.7203504426401226
Thoughtful coagulation studies and a tumor search program is recommended in these cases.	3.692684859295792
Brain-stem gliomas occur mainly in childhood and are localized in the mesencephalon, pons and medulla oblongata.	3.3210176206883246
Diagnosis is a domain of MRI, requiring T2, T1 and KM.	3.0735576758183245
CT shows hemorrhage and calcification well.	3.361260724971267
The criteria are the primary site, size, tumor growth, brain-stem enlargement, delineation, intralesional structure, exophytic components and enhancement.	3.12926626398686
Secondary criteria are herniation, hydrocephalus and liquorgenic seeding.	3.07932009954447
In CT glioma are hypodense, in MRI hyperintense in T2 and hypointense in T1.	2.7899000875399396
Enhancement is seen in 25-60% and does not allow differentiation of tumor vs nontumor or gradings.	3.5225792632410142
Factors influencing poor outcome are high grade, a short history, cranial nerve involvement, severe brain-stem enlargement, pontine site, diffuse growth and recurrency.	3.152259611280426
The 5-year-survival rate is 30% (after radiation: focal tumors 85%, diffuse 20%).	3.1801690326232985
Most frequent are symptoms of brain pressure, cerebellum, cranial nerves and pyramidal tract.	3.220885845653959
There is no agreement on whether biopsy is necessary or not.	2.701334580734089
A diagnosis of tumor is highly suggestive if classical MRI findings fit the clinical history.	2.9500223200339724
Radiobiological and physical examinations suggest clinical advantages of heavy ion irradiation.	3.324335209279068
We report the result of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999.	3.0424781249665735
The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1).	3.045083150092608
It is the first time that the intensity-controlled rasterscan-technique and the application of positron-emission tomography (PET) for quality assurance was used.	3.6524880714496226
All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1).	3.301077889701753
Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE).	2.8025185512943116
Other histologies were treated with carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopeic tumor after fractionated stereotatic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE).	3.0765768093319448
Mean follow-up was 9 months.	3.778007319194138
Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients.	3.693016273823911
One-year local control rate was 94%.	3.464705413600948
One patient (2,2%) deceased.	4.397307007718767
No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed.	3.1189897099076127
Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study.	3.6059484118922236
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary.	3.189837544410297
To continue our project a new heavy ion acclerator exclusively for clinical use is planed to be constructed in Heidelberg.	3.079598144397561
Indirect trauma to the shoulder and knee joint often results in injuries to the ligaments and the capsule, and more rarely in fractures.	3.480713309098193
Anterior shoulder dislocation is common.	3.6243433963728973
Over the last few years arthroscopic repair of the torn labrum has become established as the therapy of choice.	3.5023037664059946
A torn anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint can be compensated by the quadriceps muscle if this is adequately prepared by special exercises.	3.5182603304691256
Chronic or combined instabilities should be treated surgically by ACI grafting techniques.	3.394776282359536
Menisceal injuries are treated arthroscopically.	3.880771153606051
Objective: Comparison of low back pain (LBP) patients with and without fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) with regard to affective distress.	3.609366509417167
Methods: Patients with LBP who had been admitted to various clinics in Germany were examined upon admission.	3.1678589032981836
Comparisons were done by dividing the patients into groups with and without signs of FMS.	3.6842523863824628
Additionally, both groups were compared after being matched according to sex, age, and pain severity.	3.828575547296945
Results: 15 out of 135 LBP patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia.	2.703843301829724
Patients with FMS showed remarkably higher levels of pain severity and affective distress.	2.8280239464945875
After controlling for different levels of pain severity, these pronounced differences disappeared.	3.370637988712664
Conclusion: Affective distress is not a unique feature of FMS, but seem to be caused entirely by higher levels of pain severity.	3.593885802031758
The case definition required the typical clinical picture and a HI positive culture from a physiologically sterile site (or throat swab or tracheal aspirate in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia) in children up to 10 years.	3.3703304033498838
All initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status, type of vaccine, therapy, outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria.	4.182844024999987
The relation between the type of Hib vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame.	3.7398250565194
Results: 310 confirmed cases of invasive HI infections were reported during the observation period, 199 of these with meningitis, 56 with epiglottitis.	3.153524766448658
The number of cases declined from 71 in the last six months of 1992, 120 in 1993, and 65 in 1994 to 54 cases in 1995.	3.4672757602009048
In 1995 the incidence in up to 5 year old children was 1.1/100 000 for all infection sites and 0.7/100 000 for meningitis.	3.0989365867302263
The reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of unvaccinated cases, whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children fluctuated between 22 and 36 per year.	4.519389673844583
Most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children, who according to the German recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection.	3.8229536218009215
The type of vaccine (HbOC, PRP-D or OMP) was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children.	3.6083225146717175
10 % of the bacteria produced betalactamase.	3.840058059942252
In accordance with the German recommendations third generation cephalosporines were used in almost all cases of meningitis.	3.700233085824481
One third of these, however, received additional antibiotics.	4.1260579704291365
A further decrease, however, would be possible with "on time" completion of the vaccination schedule according to the German recommendations in all children.	3.8850680459742146
For more than a century peritoneal adhesions are being recognized as frequent sequelae following abdominal surgery.	3.2111656271987794
Intraoperative lesions of the mesothelial lining by abrasion, ischemia, dissication, and foreign bodies result in complaints, intestinal obstruction, female infertility, and problems during reoperations.	3.152973771215577
The global increase of life expectancy and surgical procedures are leading to rising incidences of adhesion-related complications and subsequent socio-economic implications.	3.4090067821192727
As of today, there is no safe and efficient prophylaxis available.	3.8781397528336807
Scientific efforts should be aimed at a liquid substance for single intraperitoneal application which significantly reduces postoperative adhesions at reasonable cost without adverse effects on blood coagulation and wound healing.	2.9036661170389793
Even today the name of F. D. von Recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.	3.1644537176555105
He was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones, and in many aspects his work remains valid today.	3.9459021161737455
He succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases.	3.491629118103509
He also described the phenomenon of "bone remodeling" which has become relevant today again.	3.134472035317945
Although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include meticulously precise differentiations which make it difficult to study them today, they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas.	3.3738039548237864
This article does not constitute a comprehensive biography, but it contains a description of F. D. von Recklinghausen's important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life.	3.1650656627081046
Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences.	4.736594364225429
Limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation.	2.928526781180713
In order to evaluate isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion (ILP) in a multimodality therapy concept, we reviewed our patients treated using this method.	3.0938383862117624
Between January 1982 and December 1995, 25 ILPs, using cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin, were performed in 22 patients with STS.	3.240991145424274
Forty percent were treated for local recurrences; histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and synovial sarcoma.	2.8599043061822553
In all, 68 % of the STS were classified as UICC stage IIb or IIIa/b.	3.170948856623025
Most of the cases (14) underwent wide or radical resection, 4 patients received intraoperative radiotherapy, and 5 were treated with external beam radiation.	4.184131698507934
Complications were recorded in 32 % of the cases.	3.5276776328957395
With a median follow-up of 45 months (range 1-143), the 5-year overall survival rate was 81 %.	4.142149610679402
The median recurrence-free time was 19 months and the 5-year disease-free survival rate 34 %.	3.647372355244686
There were 13 local failures, and distant metastases developed in 36 % of the patients.	3.2668984273476034
Concerning high-grade sarcomas (UICC stage IIb, IIIa/b), we found local recurrences in 75 % of all cases.	4.524074329901405
Five of 11 patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation, and 7 incompletely resected STS received ILP without reoperation.	2.945570923943722
All of these demonstrated local recurrence.	3.003005440437253
This rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor-free resection margins (p = 0.0001, log-rank test).	3.6639725801771363
The amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was 27 % (mean 11 months after treatment).	3.290606834168952
Long-term results of ILP showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease-free survival.	3.5099307011232943
Perfusion in patients without tumor-free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence.	3.581356428864055
We conclude that ILP with cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice.	3.396221566795399
Infections with the grampositive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs mostly in worst ill, multimorbide patients treated with cytostatica or antibiotics.	2.990236862472953
We report about two healthy children with pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile without an underlying illness or a former history of antibiotic treatment.	2.6405947102289105
Huntington's disease (HD) may cause considerable diagnostic problems because of the highly variable clinical features, especially at the beginning of the illness.	3.768963282836084
We report the case of a 21-year-old woman with definite HD whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes that were misinterpreted as schizophrenia for 7 years.	2.597015152278979
One reason for this misdiagnosis was the unusual, very early onset and the remarkable earlier age of onset of HD compared with that of other affected relatives.	3.0077510233443885
The phenomenon of earlier onset within one affected family is well documented in the literature in cases with the paternally transmitted mutated gene.	3.5439909566048358
Diagnostic landmarks were consideration of the initially mild disturbances of movement and the once again repeated detailed examination of the family history.	3.8071980819148474
ICD-10 is to be implemented for morbidity coding in Germany soon.	3.459338000229226
The electronic versions of ICD-10 are introduced.	2.3793885855411467
For everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by DIMDI: ICD-10 meta files, ICD conversion tables, ICD-10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms.	1.7588638463052335
All files are available free of charge via the INTERNET.	2.037416743026253
Because of poorly compartmentalized paraclavicular soft tissues, total extraperiostal claviculectomy in cases of malignoma with cortical destruction is always marginal.	3.0963973013767445
Due to different muscular compensation in the patients examined, literature disagrees on the biomechanical consequences of claviculectomy for the shoulder girdle.	3.1681880726494787
Thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has proved to be an established method; but intra- and postoperatively, there is a high risk of bleeding complications.	4.213840625761318
A 50-year old female with familiar hypophosphatasia and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture.	3.2846344836086154
Intraoperatively, petCO2 suddenly dropped, paCO2 rose, and circulatory arrest occurred.	2.971530915702288
CPR was started immediately with closed-chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines.	3.2596177449447015
While continuing CPR, surgery was stopped, the wound was sealed provisionally, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.	3.5322134244515566
Because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in a total dosage of 100 mg was begun.	3.127449511883183
2.25 hours after the onset of circultory arrest, and 1.5 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis, the patient's hemodynamic patterns under high-dosage catecholamines were satisfactory.	3.8815338681067857
The bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions.	3.051271219992043
The situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver, spleen and small intestines, which required surgical intervention, and acute renal failure, which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration.	3.897094111893493
Twenty-eight days after receiving CPR, the patient was discharged from the ICU.	3.6965967806048035
A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs, capnometry, blood gas analysis, and electrocardiography.	3.7870342971042406
Due to the requirements of the emergency situation (ongoing CPR), further diagnostic tools were not used.	3.5395094824418476
The patient survived without any neurological deficiency, despite the extended 135-min use of CPR, and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma, and to performing CPR in the presence of fibrinolytica.	3.514588724706672
With the increasing use of cross-sectional echocardiography in patients with overt or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency rooms, more and more right atrial thrombi are detected.	3.700032112693355
These are so-called "transitthrombi" from the venous system on their way to the pulmonary arteries and they are a severe presentation of thromboembolic disease.	3.8014621714901042
They appear as an imminent pulmonary embolism and usually coexists with an already massive embolism.	3.337459365028445
In patients were a right atrial thrombus is associated with a patent foramen ovale, paradoxical arterial embolism has been observed.	3.38761225991087
Right sided heart thrombi have a high mortality rate and need immediate treatment.	3.5813446154350284
In our hospital we have seen 14 patients with right atrial thrombi and pulmonary embolism in a period of 6 years.	3.828040412778563
Three patients had cardiac arrest with a massive pulmonary embolism, seven patients presented with a submassive embolism.	3.3742275407869173
All patients were treated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis without pulmonary angiography.	3.2356009323005126
Therapeutic options were thrombectomy, fibrinolysis or anticoagulants.	3.0810546963807637
We treated one of our patients with thrombectomy, eleven patients with fibrinolysis and two patients with anticoagulants.	3.7351436421673454
The era of modern anaesthesia in Germany began on January 24th, 1847.	3.091944468432957
This day, professor in ordinary Johann Ferdinand Heyfelder anaesthetized a patient with sulphuric ether in the clinic of surgery and ophthalmology of the University of Erlangen.	3.5646499161647998
By March 17th, 1847, Heyfelder had performed 121 surgical procedures under ether.	3.0890865230605717
The operations in majority were teeth-extractions, and a few more complex operations such as the treatment of a harelip or of lip cancer or the resection of the shoulder joint.	4.13622624283976
This monograph published in March, 1847, represents one of the first complete dissertations on sulphuric ether in the German literature.	3.3751732570185875
In a special chapter he analyzed the development of various physiological and psychological parameters during etherization.	3.543725576326332
Heyfelder also examined blood and urine of some etherized patients and reported that he did not find any important or specific alterations.	3.1276937480298193
In 1847, Heyfelder was probably the first to apply salt-ether in man.	3.3692990967995233
After 4 administrations he concluded that salt ether acted more quickly but shorter than sulphuric ether.	2.636537435475698
Advantageous were its application without problems and ease of induction.	3.5368147330271724
Disadvantageous were its high volatility, its price and the difficulty of getting it in a pure form.	3.152026386804801
From December, 1847, on Heyfelder started to use chloroform.	3.1701764296157133
He was now able to perform more major operations, for example the total resection of the hip-joint.	4.0833102801442305
In his book The experiments with sulphuric ether, salt ether, and chloroform he describes a great number of anaesthetic administrations using these 3 agents.	2.8307576274670496
In his summary Heyfelder concluded, that chloroform was undoubtly superior to sulphuric ether mainly because it was a quicker acting and longer lasting agent and leads to deeper narcosis.	2.829333264101604
Moreover its application was much easier for it needed no special apparatus.	3.143982779403374
However, because of its great anaesthetic potency, Heyfelder particularly demanded great caution in the application of chloroform.	3.2184924834926085
Explicitely he expected an assistant for chloroformizations, whose only duty was to supervise the inhalations and the patient - a forerunner of the modern specialized anaesthesiologist.	3.168481696469821
Background: To evaluate the publication rate of abstracts presented during the German Anaesthesia Congress (DAK) in MEDLINE-listed journals in comparison to the publication rate of abstracts presented during the meeting of the European Society of Anaesthesiologists (ESA).	2.5619510800251395
The uniform development of the human embryo, as described by classic human embryology, has been confirmed by sonoembryological studies.	4.219831258246016
In particular, the embryonic brain is suitable for transvaginal ultrasound examination, because the large "cystic" cavities of the brain can easily be imaged.	3.554619775812624
Sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy and normal relations and proportions of organs, but also the development of structural abnormalities.	4.266542205784617
Approximately one-third of all congenital anomalies, originate from the central nervous system (CNS).	2.88720901403165
Based on normal sonoembryology and on recent experiences with early CNS anomalies, we recognize some sonographic signs of an early CNS anomaly: (1) Apparent dysmorphology of the brain or the head; (2) Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain compartments, where the amount of fluid is either greater or less than normal; (3) In the early fetal period, choroid plexuses that are too small to fill the ventricle from the medial to the lateral wall; (4) Irregular contour of the spine/back; (5) Extra-CNS anomalies.	3.693698906525057
In the following survey, normal sonoembryology of the CNS is described, and CNS anomalies of the early pregnancy are discussed.	3.44127129653062
Telomerase is an enzyme that elongates telomeric repeats, the specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that provide genomic stability and compensate for the physiologic process of telomere shortening.	2.757666898666696
It has been implicated in cellular senescence, immortalization, and carcinogenesis.	2.946724086242894
Over 85% of human tumours, and 95% of non-melanocytic skin cancers, show telomerase activity, in contrast to the corresponding normal tissues.	3.782327822583175
This suggests that telomerase activity may play an important role in carcinogenesis.	3.0461512272112388
Recent evidence shows that telomerase is active not only in embryonal and germ line tissues, but also in some normal tissues.	3.3461754349538455
In the skin, this activity has been traced to the stem-cell-bearing epidermal basal cell layer, possibly reflecting the presence of telomerase-competent stem cells.	3.5312461938334323
These findings require a reconsideration of our interpretation of telomerase activity in tumours of the skin and other tissues.	3.4451193791276715
As a causal relationship linking telomerase activity and cancer has yet not been demonstrated, some caution is warranted.	2.945884067499998
The established criteria of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) such as JV latency, JI-V interpeak latency and interaural differences of  latency or amplitude have been found to be sensitive for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle if a response is present.	3.131402421000592
However, the ABR can be absent in cases of acoustic neuromas because of desynchronization, even though pure-one audiometry indicates that responses should be present.	3.151517635248214
This retrospective study compared the ABR and pure-tone thresholds in 234 cases with cerebellopontine angle tumors and a control group of 181 cases with sensory hearing losses in order to quantify threshold discrepancies.	3.4615475336783885
The average deficit of the objective ABR threshold (DOABRT) to the subjective pure-tone threshold for those frequencies between 1-6 kHz was 3.6 dB for the control group (ABR and pure tone thresholds very close) and 31.2 dB for the tumor group (ABR threshold much higher than the pure-tone threshold).	3.317268122442293
ABR thresholds 30 dB higher than the high-frequency pure tone thresholds were found in 40.6% of the tumor group and in none of the control group.	4.533846586452714
Thus, deficits of the ABR threshold >30 dB can be considered to be an additional criterion for detecting retrocochlear disease and increases ABR sensitivity for tumor detection even if responses are absent.	3.5015545122609786
The association of nevus flammeus with mongolian spot, nevus fuscoceruleus, nevus spilus and, with variable frequency, with nevus anemicus has been termed phacomatosis pigmentovascularis, a genodermatosis first described by Ota and co-workers.	2.8242140639551003
Four different combinations have been specified.	3.2097717327211783
Most cases are reported from the Japanese literature.	3.3338057583507736
Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis may constitute an exclusively cutaneous disorder, but overlapping with other syndromes like Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or Sturge-Weber syndrome is also possible.	2.966474355238681
We report a 30-year-old woman with nevus flammeus on the back and right arm associated with nevus fuscoceruleus on the back.	3.2583766944336543
ORIF management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type A3 of the A0 classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments, particularly when only the sliding hip-screw is used for fixation.	3.7406770357049264
A connectable butt-press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation.	3.752465986501601
We review the results with this fixation technique in 22 elderly patients with an average age of 76 years who presented with highly unstable trochanteric fracture of the A3 type.	3.638644927467748
Three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed.	3.183138835904834
The other 19 were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred.	3.038235610194355
Complaints, leg shortening and changes in the CCD angle were recorded.	4.01875109755395
Furthermore, the mobility score was determined.	3.1685535332173007
Although the patients were able to bear full weight after the operation, no lateral dislocation of fragments was observed.	3.8367134344933818
Only 1 patient had a varus dislocation of 5  ° until the fracture had consolidated.	3.557096675470829
This was due to severe osteopenia and subsequent dislocation of the screw within the femoral head.	3.4053910687740094
No pseudarthrosis, osteitis or rotational malalignment was noted.	3.1174611490662594
Five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained.	4.119819822790843
Chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space causes deposition of hemosiderin in glial cells and subsequent damage to adjacent brain tissue.	2.8633790495808187
There is a characteristic predilection for the cerebellum and eighth cranial nerve.	2.7963583340871727
Accordingly, among a variety of symptoms, cerebellar ataxia and sensorineural hearing loss progressing to total deafness commonly occur.	3.5411968584455193
To date, the hearing loss has been believed to be purely neural.	2.8204517174440853
We present a case of superficial hemosiderosis in a patient with total deafness who was successfully provided with a cochlear implant.	3.4892557951199743
Audiometry demonstrated total bilateral cochlear hearing losses but with preserved function of the eighth cranial nerve.	3.2294468758266035
These findings make us conclude that in contrast to current opinion, superficial hemosiderosis can initially damage the cochlea alone.	3.1670412272496042
Thus, patients with total deafness due to this disorder may benefit from cochlear implantation.	3.534345191886223
All patients require careful audiometric assessment, including promontory stimulation.	2.9950024507147868
Intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis.	3.769266087347556
Although most lesions are initially detected by echocardiography, additional imaging studies, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging and electron beam computed tomography, are commonly requested.	3.4875933197282043
Features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed.	4.089388844062689
For the first time, the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self-experienced neuropsychological deficits for the fater development of schizophrenia.	3.2521524230758128
Ninety-six patients with DSM-III-R diagnoses mainly of the formerly neurotic or personality disordered field, of whom 81 % had shown such basic disorders at the time of the index examination and therefore were classified as persons at high risk of developing schizophrenia, were re-examined for schizophrenia.	3.2703238422166474
After an average follow-up period of about 8 years, more than half of the re-examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to DSM-III-R.	3.470333448415096
The outcome of schizophrenia versus no schizophrenia was predicted correctly in 77 % of cases by the presence or absence of self-experienced disturbances of perception, thought, speech or action.	3.014013628051754
To date, at least 12 types of primary dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis.	3.5835488007484098
A 3-bp deletion in the DYT1 gene causes early onset, generalized torsion dystonia (TD), and mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5).	2.982963676177423
A missense change in the D2 dopamine receptor in one large family (DYT11) has recently been implicated in myoclonus-dystonia.	3.176035170047482
Furthermore, seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions, including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype (DYT6), one form of focal dystonia (DYT7), three types of paroxysmal dystonia (DYT8-10), X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT3), and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12).	3.156752856407106
No positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive TD (DYT2) and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited TD (DYT4).	3.028499624319682
In addition, hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia, metabolic and storage disorders, and various X-linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia.	3.2850988831534256
It may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely nondegenerative disorders.	3.345985058064352
In this study we investigated whether, in conjunction with neuroleptics, a psychoeducational and cognitively oriented treatment for schizophrenic outpatients and their key-persons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness within a 2-year follow-up.	3.0815437448004794
This prospective randomized study covered a total of 191 schizophrenic patients (according to DSM-III-R) and comprised a psychoeducational training and cognitive psychotherapy for patients and counseling for their key persons in various combinations.	3.3454432503192
Patients were examined before, immediately after and 2 years after the end of the intervention.	3.7029399668347653
Patients in the treatment groups reduced their overall psychopathology and their attention deficit.	3.6865708124673713
For patients receiving all three treatment conditions, there was a relevant preventive effect with regard to the rehospitalization rate appearing during the second year of the follow-up.	3.4175014899353697
We conclude that in the mid-term, a combination of psychoeducational and cognitively oriented therapy for patients and their keypersons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness.	3.937978225026234
Background: Cigarette smoking is common during pregnancy and can expose the developing fetus to transplacental carcinogens, but relatively little information is available on fetal uptake of such compounds.	2.9176893664266346
It was the aim of the present study to analyze the first urine of newborns of mothers who did or did not smoke for metabolites of the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) as well as nicotine and cotinine.	3.3730335388089236
Recently there has been an increase in the prevalent HIV infected population in Germany because of declines in progression to AIDS and death while the number of newly infected patients remains constant.This increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention.	3.2960244397740768
Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an HIV infected person by a route through which transmission is possible, is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases.	3.685513900908827
Economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether PEP should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for PEP should be used for other HIV prevention or treatment interventions.The value of PEP depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention.	3.63420513929405
In this paper, we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of PEP in different population subgroups, including those occupationally exposed, those exposed through unprotected sex, and those exposed through IV drug use.	3.2203443644970515
The cost-effectiveness of PEP is also compared to literature estimates of the cost-effectiveness of other prevention activities.	3.323004949623978
The aim of this study was to access the importance of the laparoscopic colorectal resection.	2.804557489607961
Of 131 patients 80 were operated on laparoscopically.	3.584240997622438
The conversion rate was 14 % (13/93).	3.460899460824431
A total of 47 patients suffered from cancer.	3.3958975608849618
Curative resection was performed in 41 patients (87 %).	4.186266654720996
For comparison, 48 patients who underwent open resection were used.	4.0200314264279395
Patients recovered quicker and their first oral food intake and bowel movement were earlier.	3.094908532351636
Hospital stay was shorter (15.3 vs. 8.1 days), and pain at rest and in motion was significantly reduced.	4.273655286921501
Equal numbers of mesenteric lymph nodes were retrieved; adequate margins of resection could be obtained and the length of resected bowel did not differ.	3.6585741331489365
No port metastases were observed.	3.362584272193928
Reduced morbidity, reduced hospital stay, reduced abdominal pain, quicker reconvalescence, and reduced overall health care costs are strong arguments in favor of laparoscopic colectomy.	3.484535854009665
In the field of traumatology, compartment syndromes of the lower extremity are often seen after fractures and direct injuries, or after ischaemia.	3.5178070546185887
Other causes include over-exertion and non-traumatic causes such as acute rhabdomyolysis, drug-induced myositis and eosinophilic myositis.	3.3337292328387482
This paper describes the clinical and MR course of a compartment syndrome following an ankle sprain.	3.5740823348057242
Each patient has the right of a dedicated pain therapy according to the state of the art.	3.925505197704887
However an efficient pain therapy is not possible without knowing the cause of pain.	4.2458356959770365
In most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system.	2.7438596258003254
In contrast, neuropathic pain pain is caused by lesions of the nervous system itself.	3.554466016120062
Mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions.	3.5226270040791365
The therapeutic regime of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is demonstrated by algorithms of treatment modalities.	3.1068961196994733
Apart from classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well.	3.252338695249466
Prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy.	3.395038367991978
Blockades with local anaesthetics as mono-therapy of chronic pain are obsolete.	3.9123712207174974
In posttraumatic pain, however, a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of triggerpoints may be helpful.	3.5291994471509804
The exeptional place of sympathetic blockades are in diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic maintained pain (SMP).	3.0431580362520276
Effects of 94 different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well-being in the elderly were meta-analyzed.	3.5910968824475447
Psychological well-being was improved and self-rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation.	4.036274974919922
The mean effect size for other-rated depression reached d=1.15.	2.9161334273186714
Whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self-rated well-being or depression, other-rated depression improved less in older samples.	3.262154498169926
High effect sizes derived from control-enhancing interventions and behavior therapy.	3.1203142106696524
Sub-analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting.	3.2057643679042394
Higher "therapeutic" qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect-sizes too.	3.161872429491355
Implications for planning inteventions in old age are discussed.	3.3449330728282702
The prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma worsens dramatically with the discovery of primary or secondary lymph node metastases.	3.439723387424656
Thus consistent prophylaxis and therapy of metastases is indispensable.	4.069557271556151
The standard therapy of manifest cervical lymph node metastases is surgery, if possible using the approach of conservative neck dissection.	3.6713590453133516
In cases of a lymph node stage N3, i.e.	2.8086723946498413
Objective: The German Ophthalmologic Society is rising to the challenges of the information age by offering comprehensive information resources online.	2.8255434997108866
Human recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2), alone or in combination with other cytokines, is currently under investigation for the immunotherapy of metastatic tumours.	3.5118635829378664
Objective responses of 20%-35% have been reported in patients with disseminated melanoma and renal cell carcinoma who received high-dose intravenous IL-2 in combination with interferon- (IFN).	4.457175551410915
However, treatment with IL-2 is complicated by a syndrome of life-threatening adverse reactions such as disseminated vascular leakage, fluid retention, severe hypotension, and (reversible) multiple organ dysfunction (MODS).	3.8652443162453927
A systemic inflammatory reaction (SIRS)/sepsis sepsis-like haemodynamic pattern has been described in patients after IL-2 bolus application alone.	3.6940146482191105
Our purpose was to study the haemodynamic changes in patients treated with high-dose IL-2 administered as a constant infusion and in combination with IFN.	4.174503910374521
The histopathologic diagnosis of odontogenic cysts is based mainly on the morphological nature of the epithelial lining of cysts and their origin.	3.4581205586180754
We used the international histologic classification set up by the World Health Organisation in 1992.	2.946622637525516
The aim of this study was to investigate the differentiation of various types of cyst using an immunohistochemical technique rather than by conventional morphological assessment.	2.7539674916497967
We report about particularities of "late-presenters" with congenital diaphragmatic hernias namely funnel chest and a fatal outcome of an associated acute gastric volvulus.	2.7733837753066153
The retrospective results of carbon prostheses for knee ligament reconstruction in 120 patients, as established by questionnaire, are reported at 10  +/-  2 years follow-up.	3.6101143742504003
Some 60 % of the patients showed good subjective function at reduced activity level.	3.6584744772941367
Complications were seen in 72.5 % of the patients with rupture of the carbon prosthesis and in 68 % of those with synovitis.	4.458176535710656
X-ray showed osteoarthritis in up to 59 % of the patients.	3.7039403614145585
Carbon prostheses for collateral ligament reconstruction (85 % medial, 5.8 % lateral) were successful in 75 % of cases.	3.4182441121974785
Activity and time seem to be less responsible for failure of the carbon prostheses than the features of growing in.	3.793171138962499
Destruction of the knee joint over time is due to reactive synovitis and catabolic enzyme reaction and correlates with joint effusion and pain.	3.493863835403196
If these problems appear, (arthroscopic) resection of the synovia is indicated to interrupt the circulus vitiosus.	3.0580924226734307
Background: With resprect to very early screening it has become necessary to apply laboratory techniques more sensitive and more precise than the formerly used Guthrie-test to guarantee correct detection of hyperphenylalaninemias.	2.92668908268621
The Viennese Medical School played an important role in the development of radiological examinations and signs of the temporal bone with conventional X-rays.	3.7636091754205467
Famous pioneers include E. G. Mayer (1893-1969) and L. Psenner (1910-1986).	2.8241952714044385
Nowadays conventional X-rays and tomography have lost their important role in diagnostic radiology of the temporal bone, but the basic principles established in those early years of radiology are still used now.	3.706846023998594
This statement is correct not only for conventional X-rays, but particularly for "poly"-tomography in comparison with CT.	3.424691723451602
The success of interventional catheter based therapy of coronary artery disease is still limited by a high rate of chronic restenosis.	3.688139220329558
Using alternative mechanical techniques, there is increasing evidence that restenosis can be prevented in certain subsets of patients by optimized balloon angioplasty, DCA and stenting as well as by the combined approach of primary tissue removal with adjunctive stent implantation.	3.4243226043862673
This article summarizes the mechanical techniques of restenosis prevention or reduction that have been documented in controlled trials.	3.0914042215148263
Additional pharmacologic interventions and possibly genetic and/or radiotherapeutic approaches will be highly important for future reduction of restenosis.	3.5668284277997198
A safe closure of a dura lesion is necessary on account of the risk of potentially fatal (late) meningitis.	3.664675981259393
161 duraplasties of the frontal skull base carried out from 1979 to 1994 at the ENT-department Fulda were evaluated in a retrospective study in regard to etiology, operative techniques and results.	3.5745919931404115
Duraplasty of the rhinobasis was indicated in 70 cases of rhinobasal trauma, 47 cases after paranasal sinus surgery, 36 cases of tumors and 8 malformations.	3.0878551562269085
After an average follow-up time of 6 years the patients were interviewed for postoperative liquorrhea, sinusitis treated with antibiotics and meningitis.	3.638170673131896
As an objective measure to verify the tight closure of the treated CSF-leaks a fluoreszein test was performed in 50,9 % 6 to 8 weeks after the operation.	3.7698080314898372
Duraplasty was successfull in more than 96 %.	3.7760429392823442
The approach and technique to perform a duraplasty have to be choosen individually considering size, location and etiology of the dural defect.	3.548691895552934
In the majority of dural defects in the area of the frontal skull base reconstruction can be carried out now a days via an endonasal approach.	3.499337165175902
By use of allogenic tissue, a mucosal flap from the surrounding area to cover the graft and fibrin clue good results were obtained.	3.3698449382088436
The tophus is a characteristic and pathognomonic sign of chronic gout.	3.6567845130094376
Before effective drugs were available for the treatment of hyperuricaemia about 50 - 60% of patients with gout developed clinically and radiologically apparent urate crystal deposits.	4.261287391373032
Clinical cutaneous manifestations of chronic gout are now rarely observed.	3.5628266893543374
However, the presence of degenerative tissues, as in idiopathic osteoarthritis of the fingers, may predispose to the deposition of urate crystals.	3.4546956713150516
We report on a patient with secondary - probably diuretic-induced - hyperuricaemia and gout tophi in Heberden's nodes.	2.4839614804500028
HIV-1-associated encephalopathy (HIVE) remains an important manifestation of advanced HIV infection despite recent progress in antiretroviral therapy.	3.1602548902233525
This is in part due to particular pharmacological and virological characteristics of the central nervous system (CNS).	2.675131620101123
HIVE is characterized by a "subcortical" dementia with psychomotor slowing as well as memory and concentration deficits.	4.114441062128461
An invariable finding are deficits of central motor function.	3.158728772307281
Pathogenetically, an enhanced viral replication in immunocompetent CNS cells is believed to be a requirement.	3.601351499377919
This leads to neurotoxic effects directly elicited by viral products as well as indirectly by the immune response to virus infection.	3.320016235597033
HIV-1 myelopathy (HIVM) is the other CNS manifestion of late HIV infection.	3.304649890686655
The present consensus paper recommends diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in HIVE and HIVM and outlines the current research.	2.985000272668751
Background: Prognostic data heart failure rely on epidemiological studies or large clinical trials.	2.9852690971073312
These data are not to transfer easily on everyday practice.	3.130032802594642
Forty-nine patients (mean age, 54 years) admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry.	3.7313549768151715
The mean follow-up was 36 months (range, 19-54 months).	3.2282031021820083
The deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure.	2.9860976723219856
The plantar pressure distribution showed significant load asymmetries of patients with satisfactory results and those with non-satisfactory results.	3.9321721103792457
Dynamic gait analysis allows quantification of gait asymmetry and clinically non-visible gait disorder.	2.9373769654559734
Comparison of radiation exposure applied by different types of CT scanners for the investigation of the chest and abdomen.	3.422150202422495
Determination of radiation exposure applied by multi-phase spiral CT. Estimation of the dose in air in the system axis of the scanner, the CT dose index (CTDI) and the effective dose for electron beam tomography (EBT) and two conventional CT scanners (sequence, SEQ; spiral, SCT).	3.2836891098566476
For EBT, dose in system axis for investigation of the abdomen was above 50 mGy.	3.3047257852975287
Effective dose for investigation of the chest and abdomen was higher with EBT (11 and 26 mSv, respectively) than with conventional CT (SEQ, 4 and 20 mSv; SCT, 2 and 7 mSv).	3.4339378763699395
The effective dose for a biphasic investigation (liver 5 mSv, kidney 4 mSv) was below, for a triphasic investigation (liver 7 mSv) above the effective dose of the investigastion of the abdomen (6 mSv).	3.1176326340468075
Investigation of the abdomen with the EBT should only be performed for certain indications.	3.6765093975896206
With spiral CT, effective dose is much lower than with EBT.	3.5777931354448755
Bone fracture, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients, and these patients are known to be immunocompromised.	4.117169166990613
Nonetheless, it is difficult to differentiate the effect of soft-tissue trauma plus hemorrhage from that of bone fracture and hemorrhage on host immune function in the clinical setting.	4.301031602500979
To determine this experimentally, closed bone fracture (right lower leg) and/or soft-tissue trauma (2.5 cm midline laparotomy) were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial BP of 35  +/-  5 mm Hg for 90 min) in male C3H/HeN mice.	3.405089590665011
All animals were killed at 72 h after initiation of the experiment and the spleens were collected aseptically.	3.2085545011868697
More significant depression of splenocyte IL-2 and IL-3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage.	3.3900320383152507
The present study suggests that different traumatic insults, i. e. bone fracture as well as soft-tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock, produce comparable depression of host immune function.	3.534842097715551
Moreover, combination of closed bone fracture and soft-tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity.	3.11335453083768
This indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft-tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage.	3.2213723538782206
The markedly depressed immune function following bony injury, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation.	3.621830783864019
Today, the spectrum of indications for thrombolytic drugs comprises acute myocardial infarction, lung embolism, ischaemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and acute arterial occlusions of the lower limbs.	3.504325967901614
In view of the histopathological and clinical features of retinal vessel occlusion, fibrinolysis aimed at early restoration of blood flow appears to be a promising therapeutic approach.	3.4510530788038905
Since this includes cerebral haemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, the choice of an appropriate intravenous thrombolytic therapy in a non-life threatening situation such as central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) should be based on minimising the risk of adverse events.	3.477699505112125
Furthermore, the fibrinolytic treatment of choice should be able to produce rapid and complete restoration of retinal capillary and arterial or venous blood flow and maintain patency long enough for retinal salvage to take place.	3.1849064478443068
In this article, we review several studies of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with retinal vessel occlusion to determine whether this treatment is likely to improve major clinical outcomes.	3.54457174136217
Moreover, we review the large scale trials of fibrinolysis in myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic regimens.	3.1934246860347684
Furthermore, we report on our results of fibrinolytic therapy with low dose rt-PA in patients with retinal artery occlusion and ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion.	3.6531442871326916
In light of the fact that the occurrence of bleeding complications constitutes a dose dependent problem, we conclude that the use of low dose regimens should be the ideal approach to fibrinolysis in retinal vessel occlusion.	3.8381431656129052
Although the results of our pilot studies must be interpreted with caution, we believe that the administration of low-dose rt-PA (50 mg) in a frontloaded manner ( = simultaneous administration of rt-PA and intravenous heparin) constitutes a reasonable treatment option in patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or ischaemic retinal vein occlusion (RVO), recent onset of symptoms (CRAO <= 12 h, RVO <= 11 d) and severe visual loss ( <= 20/50).	3.5725434655411914
Because of these limitations and the numerous contraindications of fibrinolytic therapy, only a limited number of patients will be suitable for this treatment.	3.7474624800111025
This study was designed to determine the relationship between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical signs of depth of anaesthesia during induction of anaesthesia by slow infusion of propofol (18 mg/kg - h).	3.5786238939089436
The object of this study was to evaluate currently published data regarding extragenital neoplasia induced by HRT.	2.864249240243788
Objective: This study was designed to investigate the differences between TIVA with propofol/remifentanil (P/R) and balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F) in gynaecological laparoscopic surgery.	3.209567384934438
Emphasis was put on haemodynamic reaction, recovery profile, postoperative side effects and patient satisfaction.	3.676281690695556
Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) is a rare dermatosis of unknown aetiology.	3.5134780324673898
Recent electron microscopic studies suggest that CRP is a disorder of keratinisation.	3.6202935117270334
In our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings.	3.2688023272927214
CRP is generally resistant to therapy.	3.646818193641712
We treated a 19-year-old patient with typical CRP with oral minocycline.	2.948326204378184
A mild relapse 7 months later responded promptly to a repeated course of minocycline.	2.9516546907680374
Twelve months after discontinuatin of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence.	3.473686423536121
In CRP minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects.	3.3196518427669988
Wound instillation seems to be an easy and preferable way to achieve postoperative analgesia in pediatric hernioplasty.	3.6003350629193447
This prospective, randomized and double-blinded pilot-study was initiated to gain preliminary information in order to define the appropriate concentration of local anaesthetic for efficient posthernioplastic analgesia.	3.4534863051283264
The recommended infusion time for i.v.	2.8631182898595964
prostaglandin E 1 (PGE1) therapy is 2 or 3 h, depending on the dose.	3.7726123239835023
The aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate, for the first time, whether the dose of 60 µg PGE1 is effective and well tolerated with shorter infusion times.	3.599547350060204
A total of 118 patients with intermittent claudication and a pain-free walking distance between 50 and 200 m (3 km/h, 12%) were randomized to receive an i.v.	2.927038754524171
infusion of 3 ampoules Prostavasin (60 µg PGE1) administered for either 1 or 2 h, once a day for 4 weeks.	3.3677636703179994
Primary variables were pain-free walking distance as well as safety, determined by the frequency of adverse events and the course of blood pressure.	5.395711058383701
The efficacy was comparable in the two groups.	3.360124343337202
In the 1-h infusion group, the pain-free walking distance increased from 87 to 135 m, and in the 2-h group from 88 to 147 m, while the absolute walking distance increased from 124 to 200 m and from 147 to 238 m, respectively.	3.288867510598889
The differences between the two groups were not significant, although an analysis of subgroups with initial pain-free walking distances of less than 80 m indicated a significant difference in favour of the 2-h PGE1 infusion (increase in walking distance 58 m as compared with 22 m).	3.2922330199237475
Altogether, in intermittent claudication both the 1-h and the 2-h PGE1 infusion show comparably good results in terms of efficacy and safety.	3.4749051103125033
Patients with an initial pain-free walking distance of less than 80 m seem to reveal a major benefit after a 2-h PGE1 infusion.	3.117304992943971
The problem in the treatment of deep hyalin cartilage defects is due to the minimal regeneration potential of this specific tissue.	4.316211641658664
The proliferative potential of autogenous perichondrium/periost is well-known for decades.	3.4913875832460732
Gender identity change in intersexual patients is rare.	3.103985146321688
We report on the transsexual development of a patient with male pseudohermaphroditism.	3.6441898048245767
The case report emphasizes the importance of a thorough differential diagnosis.	3.209303990385059
We report on three HIV patients demonstrating bullous cutaneous eruptions in the irradiation field.	2.7280612747605835
Three homosexual men (age 45-60 y) stage of disease CDC 3C, were treated with fractionated soft X-rays with the scheme conventionally used by us (total dose 30 Gy, single doses 3 Gy).	3.341316728544152
Immediately to three days after completion of treatment large blisters appeared within the irradiation field, resolving after 2-4 weeks, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.	3.3308030213263
The cause of this rare reaction to soft X-ray therapy, potentially suggesting an individually altered radiation sensitivity, is so far unknown.	3.434001278682592
Controlled prospective studies applying different fractionation schemes will be necessary to better elucidate this issue.	3.1098962358588484
Due to the decreased trauma in anterior as well as posterior surgical approaches to the spine, microsurgical techniques have been used more frequently in recent years.	4.268739162172999
This article describes two new microsurgical techniques to approach the anterior lumbar spine for interbody fusion as part of a posterior-anterior stabilization concept in various diseases like spondylolisthesis, degenerative instability; failed back surgery syndrome, fractures etc.	2.864850457252334
The lumbar segments L 2-5 are approached through a blunt muscle-splitting retroperitoneal technique.	3.2347923959078617
The antero-lateral circumference of the motion segment is exposed with a frame-type retractor which is anchored in the adjacent vertebral bodies with anchoring screws.	2.902997093448357
The lumbosacral junction is exposed via a mini-laparotomy using a special soft tissue spreader.	2.9668620314887972
Interbody fusion is described with autogeneous bone grafts.	3.542267066902879
Preliminary experience with 83 patients treated between 1995 and 1996 show that peri- and postoperative morbidity is low.	3.683221495948547
Clinical as well as radiological results are comparable to the standard techniques.	4.6875357963980475
Spectrum as well as rate of complications so far do not differ from those described in the literature for non-microsurgical approaches.	4.367887707241053
The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint.	4.321414488961664
Its origin is at the lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle and the insertion is located in the posterior part of the intercondylar area.	4.917746504767686
The posterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles.	2.9451560809586534
From a functional point of view, one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur.	3.147534368796494
The anterior fibers insert in the anterolateral part of the tibial insertion zone.	3.2813894295929287
These fibers become tense when the knee is flexed.	2.4911075121139494
The posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended.	2.9300892565555503
The main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type I collagen positive dense connective tissue.	3.5295821453413616
The longitudinal fibrils of type I collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type III collagen positive fibrils.	3.013475613016851
In this region, the structure of the tissue resembles fibrocartilage.	3.8302329042863743
Oval-shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils.	3.1513399045398787
The femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral apophyseal enthesis.	3.499626906675757
Near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia there should be various mechanoreceptors which might have an important function for the kinematics of the knee joint.	3.4104517100860505
The blood supply of the PCL arises from the middle geniculate artery.	3.109539603975347
From the synovial sheath, the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a transverse direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	3.0348462790767026
The distribution of blood vessels within the PCL is not homogeneous.	2.8326140757304183
We detected three avascular areas within the ligament: Both fibrocartilaginous entheses of the PCL are devoid of blood vessels.	2.891231916216029
A third avascular zone is located in the central zone of fibrocartilage of the middle third region.	3.5164384114536995
Atrial reentrant tachycardias (ART) are a potentially life-threatening complication in survivors of congenital heart disease surgery.	3.489551021538627
From July 1993 to December 1997, temporary transesophageal pacing was used to convert 29 tachycardia episodes in 19 patients.	3.2924371137782202
At the time of the first tachycardia episode, patients' ages were 1 month to 26 years (mean 9.8 yrs).	3.280406995839169
Onset was within the first 2 weeks postoperatively in 6 patients and occurred later in 13 patients (1 to 19 years after operation).	3.871788923332801
Postoperative pacemaker implantation had been performed in 2 pts; 17 of 19 pts were receiving antiarrhythmic medication.	3.5234176159986403
After placing a quadripolar transesophageal catheter, atrial and ventricular signals were recorded and atrial stimulation performed.	3.0088992050292913
Atrial cycle length of tachycardia ranged from 160-380 ms with 1:1 to 4:1 AV conduction.	3.0438589503234863
Temporary transesophageal pacing was performed following an algorithm starting with 4 extrastimuli (20 ms below atrial cycle length of tachycardia).	2.93659863493693
Tachycardia terminated in 27 of 29 cases (93%) without complications.	3.5083549667606304
In 3 cases, conversion was achieved by pacing after amiodarone 5 mg/kg i.v.	3.1537483259394787
After tachycardia conversion, sinus- or pacemaker rhythm was present in 20 cases.	3.4503145173783345
In 9 cases atrial fibrillation was recorded; spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm occurred after a maximum of 3 min (7 cases) or persisted and required direct current cardioversion (2 cases).	3.3295659181443886
In conclusion, transesophageal atrial pacing is an effective, relatively noninvasive method for conversion of atrial reentrant tachycardias after operation for congenital heart disease.	3.083118398982528
After elucidating the components and theory of neuroticism (N) as well as of psychosomatic complaints and their relationships to personality dimensions and to psychosomatic diseases, comparisons are performed between patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) or related pain diseases with healthy subjects scoring high on personality dimensions related to neuroticism.	3.1798847664402285
FMS and pain patients score high on depression, anxiety, and experience of stress although questionnaire scores on depression are higher in subjects not exhibiting somatic features of the disease.	3.3203638157223128
High subjective pain sensitivity and low thresholds for pain perception are also common features in high N subjects and FMS patients.	3.1684443803458846
On the endocrinological level cortisol responses to challenge tests with CRH as well as prolactin responses to TRH are higher in FMS patients than in high N healthy subjects indicating an endocrinological difference.	3.1934564731040966
A common feature, however, is the lack of adapatability in the two groups, since neurotics are in particular characterized by a low capacity to shift their behavior from one state to the other (waking-sleeping, working-relaxing), to re-adapt to baseline levels after endocrinological or physiological stress responses, or to adjust to conditions of shift work.	3.425900539067448
This is reflected by chronobiological disturbances in FMS patients and could also explain their maintainance of pain perception, because they are incapable of correcting conditioned pain-producing muscle tension.	2.9731409320537914
Purpose: To document our experience with spiral hydro-CT of the pancreas based on a combination of pharmacologic intestinal paralysis and water distension of the stomach and duodenum with specific reference to tumor detection rate, differentiation of malignant versus benign tumors and assessment of tumor resectability in a prospective study on 211 consecutive patients.	3.6379870481448187
Since the publication of a case of Syphilis transmission by blood transfusion in 1915 the discussion about transfusion-associated bacterial infection is ongoing.	3.3855722848869756
For some time, virus infections through blood and blood products have been highlighted.	3.1435333812672304
However, in the last years the attention required has been drawn to the problem of transmission of bacteria.	3.772425747317234
In this publication the present situation concerning the contamination rates through blood components and the frequency of transfusion-associated microbial infections is outlined.	2.96492013202396
The bacteria involved are discussed.	3.2647481320190552
Furthermore, the state of the art for prevention and diagnosis as well as the methods for inactivation of bacteria are assessed.	3.4421217336604077
While working to develop a distal locking device, we analyzed distal nail position with reference to nail deformation and a radiographic-morphometric investigation.	3.3933210032199077
The amount and the direction of implant deformation in unslotted stainless steel unreamed tibial nails (Synthes) were analyzed.	2.935705661690106
Measurement of implant deformation (3 translations, 3 angles) in the center of the distal transverse locking hole was performed with a 3D magnetic motion tracker system before and after nail insertion.	3.722613273618551
Unreamed tibial nails (diameter 8 mm, n = 10; diameter 9 mm, n = 10) were inserted in paired human cadaver tibiae.	3.4045362586912753
The results showed lateral translations of -4.5+/-3.5 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 14.3 mm) and dorsal translations of -7.8+/-5.8 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 19.2 mm).	2.5791718513990625
Rotational deformations around the longitudinal axis of the nail were 0.3+/-0.7 ° (mean and standard deviation, range 2.4 °).	3.277292418280941
The results showed, that a simple aiming arm, mounted on the proximal nail end, alone or even in combination with a large working channel (e.g.	3.122656557979087
10 mm in diameter), was not adequate to the aiming process.	3.770882061335781
A radiographic-morphometric analysis was subsequently performed in 40 tibiae after experimental (n = 20) or clinical (n = 20) implantation of nails 8 mm and 9 mm in diameter.	3.368369676814293
These measurements showed a relatively constant distance between the upper distal transverse hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia (average 12.3 mm and only a narrow range (7.6 mm).	2.9246552878408485
These data were the basis for the development of an aiming technique that exploits the relatively constant distance between the distal nail hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia.	3.1895885460721756
The goal of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Aging (ILSE) is to assess healthy and satisfying aging in middle adulthood and later life.	2.716432735672428
The data for this study were collected between late 1993 and early 1996 as part of the first measurement point of the ILSE.	4.24751942925793
Five-hundred and one participants from the Leipzig region were compared with 500 participants from the Heidelberg area on four specific dimensions: personality, cognitive functioning, subjective well-being, and health.	3.1363846011027445
Age differences were obtained for neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.	3.1858839432967603
Differences were also obtained in cognitive functioning and health.	3.159098331942516
Regional differences between eastern and western Germany were obtained in the personality dimensions neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.	3.441190834706265
Significant age by region interactions were obtained for openness and some of the cognitive measures, as well as for the physicians' health ratings of the participants, suggesting selective historical effects.	3.4738964130797187
The results are discussed with respect to functional abilities and levels of satisfaction in midlife, as well as with respect to regional differences that might be due to prior political system differences in the east and west.	3.575192154998757
Modern obstetrics must try to maintain high safety standards for both mother and child and, at the same time, satisfy the general desire of women for natural birth.	3.339954592491508
Standards of safety are based on early recognition of high risks, allowing early intervention to prevent serious complications.	3.617031660263399
A considerable number of diagnostic and therapeutic measures recommended on a prophylactic basis and therefore widely used are responsible for the medical-technical image associated with modern obstetrics.	3.3953681327063774
The benefits of most of these prophylactically recommended activities are unproven or low relative to the unavoidable side effects and the costs associated with widespread application.	3.1658437055840642
There is good scientific proof that routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring during labor and delivery is associated with an increase in the rate of cesarean sections as well as operative vaginal deliveries without any clear benefit to the newborn in terms of a decrease in mortality or morbidity.	3.8047345510513706
In a population of healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, the prevalence of perinatal mortality or morbidity is so low that even with meta-analysis of several studies the numbers remain too small to show significant differences for these rare events.	3.229529540810251
In high-risk cases the routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring throughout labor and delivery is undisputed and leads to a significant drop in morbiditiy and mortality of the baby.	3.5248899143798504
With careful selection of pregnant women a combination of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and auscultation during certain segments of the first stage of labor provides adequate surveillance.	3.4933205110324543
We report the history of a 38 year old patient who began to develop mental deterioration at the age of 26.	4.120615247454088
After a time of 7 years neurological signs like writing dystonia occured.	3.3236598153630577
HSD is a rare autosomal-recessive or sporadic disease of unknown etiology.	3.915084204524976
In one third of the patients a dementing process is the first clinical sign of the disorder, and is a rare differential diagnosis of early onset dementia.	5.634772726738388
In 33 patients with chronic venous incompetence (CVI) caused by primary varicoses or postthrombotic syndrome stage I-III (according to Widmer) the therapeutic benefit of 6 months of medically supervised physical exercise training was documented.	3.5059864204264253
During the training penud there was an improvement in subjective complains such as pain and tendency for edema in the legs.	3.1447815655322593
Mobility in the upper ankle joint was improved asuss as venous drainage function.	3.711752537044539
Clinical benefit was achieved in the reduction of ulcer size; 7 of 10 ulcers completely healed.	3.8210846493177315
Medically supervised physical exercise training and optimized compression therapy are basic therapeutic approaches in conservative treatment in chronic venous insufficiency.	3.40858320900991
Costs are covered by the patient's health insurance company in Germany, as long as the exercise training is medically supervised.	3.8733048488803847
Epileptic seizures may alter autonomic functions.	3.382478334664179
This is especially the case with complex focal seizures (of temporal lobe origin) and grand mal.	3.1022853779639665
Most frequently, such seizures cause ictal tachycardia, sometimes tachypnea, probably caused by the propagation of epileptic discharges to autonomic cerebral structures.	2.9706352463641688
Ictal bradycardia and asystole are rare phenomena.	3.3432807715292525
However, they may be life threatening.	3.911897307070741
Their differentiation from primary cardiac arrest is possible by the use of ictal EEG and ECG registration.	3.7898473784699407
Postictal serum prolactin measurement does not differentiate syncope from seizure.	3.074098856131968
However, a postictal increase of creatine kinase is only measured after epileptic seizures and not after syncope.	2.6886596527942186
Treatment of such epileptic seizures includes an optimization of anticonvulsant drug therapy and the implantation of a cardiac demand stimulator.	3.3474372953176035
There is growing evidence that ictal asystole is a cofactor in sudden unexplained death in epileptic patients.	2.795295686122917
A minimal documentation system (MIDOS) has been developed for self-assessment of pain and other symptoms by the patients on palliative care units.	3.839553314499265
To decrease the administrative burden and thereby increase the acceptance of the system an electronic database was developed to facilitate data entry and documentation.	3.3776456442591307
Background: Hearing loss can be found in more than 50% of children with Down syndrome.	3.7988326312063787
Chronic or recurrent middle-ear effusions are considered the most frequent etiology with an incidence of 60%.	3.9260608251184963
Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare semimalignant cutaneous neoplasm characterised by slow but locally aggressive growth.	3.627409215632425
Its histogenesis and nomenclature are still a subject of controversy.	3.3752210388625996
Under-recognition and the tumour's bland cytologic features lead to frequent misdiagnoses.	2.791655469340625
In addition, subclinical tumour invasion explains the high incidence of local recurrence.	3.258538341247482
Thus, the tumour makes great demands on the planning of its surgical removal.	3.1572432007214926
We report the case of an 81-year-old woman with a microcystic adnexal carcinoma of the lower lip, which was treated by micrographic surgery.	3.7140371237032093
On the basis of this case, differential diagnoses, histogenesis and micrographic surgery as the treatment of choice are discussed.	3.717743826185895
In old age, individualization processes also simultaneously effect the opportunity and necessity to shape one's life.	2.917705283868767
Societal orientation dissipates, and the certainties of earlier times disappear.	4.012734300841257
Plurality and option appear as an increasing twofold challenge to coping with life.	3.2160075676398403
These ambiguities characterize modern old age.	3.1523538368081563
Or in other words: the biographization of old age has begun.	3.4067377649318704
Posttraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with a poor outcome.	3.691377686827485
When evaluating the literature according to the Utstein method, there were only 2 survivors (0.18%) out of 1,135 CPR attempts after trauma (Table 1).	3.3773396715464155
Differences in the study populations and levels of prehospital trauma care led us to analyse the results of a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system in Cologne.	3.8582857193819335
From January 1987 to December 1990, a total of 49,054 emergency calls were registered using a standardised protocol.	3.244845754269475
Among 9,595 trauma-related calls, 636 patients were found to be pulseless on arrival of the emergency team, 412 of these were pronounced dead.	3.229403354162224
CPR was initiated in the remaining 224 patients, who comprise the study population (defined as 100%).	3.7542672566457194
All patients who were admitted to a hospital were followed using a second protocol.	3.7821911699534363
CPR in the field was successful in 68 (30.4%) patients, who were then admitted to a hospital; 42 of these died within the first 24 h. Four patients (1.8%) could be discharged from hospital alive and were still living 1 year later, 1 with a lasting neurological deficit (Fig.	3.928572601781298
In 156 (69.6%) cases resuscitative attempts were unsuccessful in the field.	3.2868262405511093
Survival has to be regarded as an individual fate; the overall results are discouraging.	3.848253896718247
Even though this study analyses the largest population of posttraumatic CPR ever published, prognostic factors could not be identified due to the few survivors.	3.6649690902000507
Nevertheless, the result does not justify general omission of CPR after trauma as: (1) prognostic factors for survival have not been identified thus far; and (2) no significant additional costs arise from posttraumatic CPR.	3.4576175375100764
Functional voiding disturbances can be due to failure of the detrusor or to discoordinated sphincter function during micturition.	3.4657769540657033
Therapeutical options are directed either to strengthening the contraction up to an adequate magnitude or to lowering the voiding resistance or can be aimed at influencing both.	3.071107569616881
In a brief survey mechanical, pedagogical, electrotherapeutical, and surgical measures as well as drug treatment are critically examined.	3.728539696057591
Conservative methods should always be attempted before surgical procedures are performed.	3.8863120819552486
Depending on the degree of severity and the etiology of the disease, a combined therapy can be useful.	4.902330569485119
In the case of resistance to therapy, intermittent autocatheterism is to be preferred to permanent deviation via an indwelling catheter.	3.4152081901169344
During long-term therapy of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol (300 mg/d) two patients developed generalized granuloma annulare.	3.473949461282685
The diagnoses were confirmed by histology; concomitant diseases, especially diabetes mellitus, were not detectable.	3.7085841404359727
Following discontinuation of allopurinol therapy, cutaneous granulomas healed without relapse.	3.0236690533790207
Hyperuricaemia could be controlled by low-purine diet and medication avoiding allopurinol.	3.359590283143715
The clinical history of our two patients suggested a causal connection between allopurinol therapy and generalized granuloma annulare.	3.006206986359159
For this reason we rate the development of this disease in both cases as a rare but significant side effect of allopurinol.	4.569207127834145
This should give rise to critical assessment of concomitant drug therapy during development of generalized granuloma annulare.	2.9191541589078547
Background: Aim of the present prospective longitudinal study was the statistical foundation and thus further replication of recent findings of Hasenbring [13], who postulated a significant importance of specific, within the psychological pain research long neglected pain coping strategies as risk factors concerning pain chronification: appeals to "stick it out" on the cognitive level and endurance strategies on the behavioural level.	3.198409617955515
Intraarticular bleeding and muscle bleeding occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma in hemophilia A or B.	3.589446403407036
The most common sites for hemarthrosis are the knees joints, elbows and ankles joints.	2.78803073243894
Resorption of intraarticular blood induces reactive hemophilic synovitis.	3.1894908131969886
Hyperplasia of the synovium can be followed by recurrent bleedings.	3.895848984719176
These early reactions can change to a chronic synovitis and cause cartilage damage, finally resulting in a complete destruction of the joint.	3.708778355808132
Since 1981 158 adults and 61 children with a hemophilia A or B were treated at the Center for hemophilic disorders Frankfurt in an interdisciplinary approach.	3.162753133466637
Consequent prophylactic treatment with factor substitution can prevent the incidence of severe hemarthrosis.	3.8945740534670032
Minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution, temporarily non-weight bearing of the extremity, application of ice-packs and physical therapy.	3.454481748970832
More severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis.	4.131677644788324
This is followed by a consequent physical therapy (joint and soft tissue techniques) and anti-inflammatory drugs.	3.1629868252745803
The goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint, the improvement of the coordination, and the proprioception.	5.021767914662408
The chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions.	3.114063111616542
Local ice application, sytemic and local anti-inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy.	3.2542529757891
Soft heel shock absorber, elastic and semi-rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement.	2.6981179891858056
Synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis.	4.563086007343243
Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO), which is an alternative in certain cases, has been performed with great success in 12 cases in our hospital.	4.606622989624643
In advanced arthropathy joint mobilization should be the emphasis of the physical therapy.	3.4732275868044216
Bandages, crutches and ortopaedic shoe devices improve the walking capacity.	2.9732147170569436
Over an 18-month period findings of stress X-ray of the ankle and medical records of 112 cases were analyzed retrospectively as to indications, results and therapeutic consequences.	3.382044577628761
The analysis showed that critical setting of indications can reduce the frequency of stress X-ray of the ankle and thus lower the total costs.	3.6242802411973476
The introduction of guidelines could be advantageous at medical training institutions.	2.7801499316972667
A 72-year-old patient received 0.1 mg morphine by the intrathecal route and 2x1.5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy.	3.2346461376464024
Severe respiratory depression and somnolence supervened 3.5 h later, which lasted over the next 24 h and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.	3.2276563059503935
Continuous administration of >6 mg naloxone to antagonize the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect.	3.1573002895945064
The patient's condition was not normalized until a single dose of 0.3 mg flumazenil was administered.	3.020780768386245
For the time being, especially in the case of elderly patients, we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than 0.1 mg morphine is given.	3.7478003059783087
Respiration should be monitored for quite some time.	3.753626749023362
In contrast to the often debated NYHA classification, the determination of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) by cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows an objective assessment of the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).	3.3854660473362044
However, cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a time consuming and costly diagnostic tool, which requires sophisticated equipment and specially trained personell.	3.2509949007115355
Exercise capacity can also be determined by the 6 minute walk test.	3.9879806482970745
This test simply measures the distance covered by strong walking on a hallway level within 6 minutes.	3.078373415648833
The 6 minute walk test is a submaximal exercise test, which is associated with much smaller increments in heart rate, blood pressure and plasma catecholamines than cardiopulmonary exercise testing.	3.6595099283596806
It is characterized by a very small intraindividual variance.	3.132605239301154
Furthermore, it can be easily performed and, due to low logistic and personal requirements, it is very cost effective.	4.363102085185099
The results of the 6 minute walk test - as well as of cardiopulmonary exercise testing - are influenced by extracardial exercise-limiting disorders, such as pulmonary diseases.	3.359039908949344
Independent from the etiology of CHF, the results of the 6 minute walk test are closely related to peak VO2.	3.6183242711603536
In serial exercise testing the distance covered within 6 minutes allow to predict the individual peak VO2.	3.3425265924408283
Like peak VO2 the 6 minute walk test has been shown to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in CHF, with its predictive value being independent from left ventricular ejection fraction and other potential prognostic parameters.	3.46575204842342
In CHF patients a walking distance < 300 m is associated with a one-year-mortality of up to 50%, whereas the one-year-mortality in patients reaching a walking distance > 450 m amounts to only a few percent.	4.454062403451698
In addition, the hospitalization rate of patients reaching a walking distance of < 300 m is several fold higher than in those with a walking distance >= 450 m. Like cardiopulmonary exercise testing, the 6 minute walk test allows to control the efficiency of specific treatments and to monitor the natural course of the disease.	3.1135683987036127
The 6 minute walk test is, thus, a cost effective alternative to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in CHF patients.	3.351171568581384
However, neither the 6 minute walk test alone nor the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing alone are sufficient for selecting patients, e.g., for cardiac transplantation, as each individual case requires a synopsis of all relevant facts and parameters.	3.3755994085349625
We report the first case of prurigo pigmentosa in the German literature.	3.1948671111813343
For over a year, a 16-year old white girl developed an immensely pruritic symmetrical reticular, papulo-vesicular eruption on the trunk, axillae and pubic region.	3.1119121707810944
Histologically a superficial  perivascular spongiotic and lichenoid  inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed.	2.9061945165760625
Topical corticosteroids and  systemic antihistamines had no effect.	3.0168924454866444
Systemic corticosteroids and diaminophenylsulphone (DADPS) produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences.	2.9580766228071083
Healing  occurred only after 4 weeks of systemic- minocycline.	3.6027622984049676
Following parenteral administration, clonidine has analgesic effects at both cerebral and spinal levels.	3.072368786867913
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) makes it possible to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations.	2.931742041490512
Therefore, we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery.	4.016574882430868
The effects of glycerol are discussed in detail.	2.8836243299573874
Glycerol can lead to a transition of crystalline lipid structures within the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.	3.27507475758125
Especially if applied in oil/water-emulsions it improves, the hydration of the horny layers better than urea.	3.007684814312327
In addition, if facilitates the dissolution of desmosomes within the superior layers of the horny layer enhancing desquamation.	2.781947137931485
Furthermore, by using glycerol, the mechanical properties of the skin can be influenced; long term used leads to increased elasticity.	3.5764873027176876
The roughness of the horny layer is reduced, which can be explained by the abrasive and/or the hydrating effect.	3.8717965797180423
Glycerol used in o/w-emulsions also protects against the influence of tensides or noxious lipophilic agents.	3.0680700169511907
Presumably a flux from the base of the epidermis towards its surface triggers the regeneration of the barrier.	3.442970289896694
Finally,  glycerol can lead - similarly to urea - to an improvement in active agent penetration, as has been proven for hexylnicotinate.	3.3334539232757083
Background: An 18-year-old woman presented with thyrotoxic symptoms - right sided lid retraction and exophthalmus.	3.091792793704815
She complained of diplopia on lateral gaze.	3.0821381438170143
Laboratory investigations confirmed Grave's disease with hyperthyroidism and TSH receptor antibodies.	2.8656253533022014
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.	3.9569975929786905
The safe and effective treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias is being intensively studied.	4.1872896735236225
Internal electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has been shown to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment option.	4.151028122062642
Cardioversion therapy has been applied in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing the process.	4.441700377401381
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using sophisticated optical mapping techniques reveal that internal cardioversion shocks cause changes in repolarization time that favor annihilation of wave fronts.	2.7146677129899124
Thus, mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to ventricular defibrillation.	3.3958981817847147
Further studies are needed to determine whether cardioversion mechanisms differ for chronic atrial fibrillation compared to acute atrial fibrillation.	2.9170043031233157
Plasmocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow, typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia, proteinuria, anemia and hypercalcemia.	3.735761743942253
In its progress, deposits of amyloids in  almost all organs can be observed.	3.1737841166477136
However, plasmacytomas which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare.	2.9008151102614828
This case report presents a 61-year-old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations.	3.613916074546375
A biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light-chain type, which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with lambda light-chains stage II after Durie and Salmon.	3.4605992266444767
In the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro-enteric system.	3.1101911563435323
However, reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known.	3.41271597471849
Aim: Improved detection of pulmonary-venous pathologies by imaging the pulmonary veins without arterial overlay.	3.1607607082924285
For the histological verification of suspicious non-palpable small breast tumors, the three-dimensional breast biopsy applied as cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system is the optimal solution at present.	3.192067169043617
Because of the possibility of performing mammography during the operation, errors of localization can be corrected and incorrect incisions avoided.	3.095355178201578
These structures should be preoperatively marked by using sonography.	3.263011717289013
After the complete removal of suspicious microcalcification checked by digital mammography during the operation, residual tumor might be found in a second excision when histologically invasive or intraductal tumor terminations reach the excision margin (R1 resection).	3.0959014823847513
Thirteen invasive and 8 intraductal carcinomas were found in 80 cases of cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system.	3.1010824706071842
In 7 procedures carried out to exclude an in-breast recurrence, 3 intraductal carcinomas and 1 invasive carcinoma were observed.	3.27493857268764
In 8 of 12 invasive carcinomas and in 1 of 5 intraductal carcinomas, breast-conserving therapy was indicated.	3.389600398939308
Two cases of invasive carcinoma fulfilled the criteria applied (minimal tumor-free margin > 2 mm, no extensive intraductal component) to use the ABBI cylinder as lumpectomy without a second excision to follow.	3.2988052970317816
With the increasing number of patients surviving after therapeutic intervention for congenital heart disease (CHD), accurate and frequent follow-up of their morphologic and functional cardiovascular status is required, preferably with a noninvasive imaging technique.	3.5103186163715816
In a retrospecitve multicenter study we followed-up 30 fractures of the neck of the femur in children aged 11 years (1.5-15 years) for 4.8 years (0.5-20.0 years).	3.5296832576818176
It is the aim of this study to analyse factors possibly related to outcome, like age at injury, type of fracture, interval between injury and treatment, method of stabilization and postoperative interval until full weight bearing.	3.220297211724251
At follow-up subjective parameters (pain, weather sensitiveness), clinical parameters (range of motion, claudication, leg length discrepancies) and radiological parameters (hip series) were investigated and medical charts and roentgenograms were reviewed using a standardized protocol.	3.4483746470255046
29 of 30 children (96.7 %) have sustained displaced fractures.	3.0756446855943596
Non-operative treatment has been applied in 4 children.	3.942398596854313
26 femoral neck fractures (type I: 1, type II: 8, type III: 17) were stabilized by internal fixation using screws and/or pins.	3.9890659590829047
Following non-operative treatment one child suffered a coxa vara and another child suffered a avascular femoral head necrosis in combination with coxa vara and leg length shortening of 4 cm.	3.3752921101543163
Following operative treatment 9 of 26 children (34.6 %) sufferred a avascular femoral head necrosis and 3 children (11.5 %) suffered a coxa vara.	2.9766810770117416
In 6 of 26 children (23 %) we observed leg length discrepancies > 2 cm.	3.261645803861838
We were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differencies between the groups of children who have sustained type II or type III fractures, or between the groups of children aged < 10 years when compared to children aged > 10 years, or between the group of children who were operated on within 6 hours after the accident when compared to the group of children operated > 6 hours after the accident.	3.3427052025566253
We observed no significant follow-up result differences between the groups of children who had different intervals between operation and full weight bearing.	3.0654943039499627
Operative fracture management remains the treatment of choice in the majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in children.	3.882457572952692
However, in our limited study we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differences between the group of children treated by immediate open reduction and internal fixation (interval injury - operation < 6 hours) when compared to children who had been operated > 6 hours after the injury.	3.225940655179817
Evidence based standards for structure quality in out-patient management of chronic pain states do not exist.	3.433955541846143
Therefore we tried to evaluate if german standards for outpatient management of chronic pain states which are based on opinions of experts for pain management influence the outcome quality of independent physicians for treatment of chronic low back pain.	3.8122196606657694
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare low dose dopamine and dopexamine with respect to of liver-venous oxygen saturation, oxygen delivery and - demand, liver function tests and cardiocirculatory effects  in the reperfusion period during a hemihepatectomy operation with occlusion of the liver hilus.	3.4875014338179406
Facial trauma is frequent and mainly caused by motor vehicle accidents.	3.1312458740713645
Due to this main etiologic factor, trauma to the facial skeleton is often associated with serious injuries, commonly involving the brain, chest or abdomen.	3.1046509664826902
As a consequence, the initial clinical management of these patients includes control of hemorrhage and immediate assessment of life-threatening injuries, including the maintenance of the airways.	4.057623242337444
Patients presenting with facial trauma are initially evaluated with a systematic clinical examination because many fractures can be accurately diagnosed by inspection and palpation alone.	2.8896806338749785
In these cases plain film radiographs serve only for confirmation and documentation of the diagnosis.	3.116522970558957
In many other cases accompanying and extensive soft tissue swelling may clinically obscure fractures.	2.8445089801576593
A complete and accurate evaluation of these patients requires additional radiological imaging methods.	3.439685422705464
A series of plain films may be generally sufficient but in most of the cases they can be regarded as initial screening methods for more thorough diagnosis with computed tomography (CT).	3.805972643671037
In trauma patients CT is the imaging method of choice because it shows more fracture lines and displaced fragments than any other imaging modality.	3.3109357621642133
CT delineates soft tissue and bony structures and can localize and even characterize foreign bodies.	3.305018583103803
A complete and accurate characterization of the fracture type and potentially associated complications is mandatory for the appropriate treatment and can only be achieved by careful radiological (CT) evaluation.	3.8803935809242613
On the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds, surgery rates and small-area variations within the catchment area of the AOK Magdeburg were examined for the year 1997.	3.2705314780932113
Substantial variation can be constantly seen.	3.1996973348346733
The extremal quotient at the 30 most frequent ICPM groups ranged from 2 to 5.	2.97243418854116
Generally, the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute.	3.3156267786747025
Correlation analyses do not show clear associations with hospital bed supply and physician density in primary sectors.	2.975089458758305
The extent of the small-area variation requires further research to evaluate possible determinants of surgery rates.	3.7289142805897337
Criteria for hospital admission and indications for surgery should be made explicit.	3.9633833117782467
Between 1984 and 1994 the legally required task force "Advisory Committee to the German Federal Health Office in Matters of Approval and Review of Existing Medicines B3-Psychiatry, Neurology, Anesthesiology" analyzed and evaluated the CNS-active compounds that until then had only possessed a fictitious registration.	2.59014733203328
The evaluation was related to efficacy and safety within the indications claimed by the producers.	3.1936214458616567
Reviews and monographies had to be established for 445 basic compounds.	4.063845182196338
One hundred positive and 30 negative monographies were published.	3.107471717761826
"Negative" indicates that none of the claimed indications could be accepted by the committee.	3.303248697876927
It is regrettable that the Federal Health Agency did not notice a considerable part of these negative evaluations until the present date.	2.8170453522312084
The process of the "Aufbereitung" was stopped abruptly by the 5th amendment of the German Drug Law in August 1994, - a very doubtful political decision with respect to drug safety in this country.	3.481011736851128
Background: We attempted to illustrate connections between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammation course in patients after cataract operations.	3.5019009401831434
Without a more detailed knowledge of etiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis final conclusions regarding an association between physical trauma and the onset or course of multiple sclerosis cannot be drawn.	3.440224550559278
Only a few prospective studies which are appropriately designed to prove a putative correlation have been published.	3.042564759689632
A critical review of these studies and some case reports, in the light of the current pathophysiological concepts of multiple sclerosis, does not indicate a causal relationship between physical trauma and onset of multiple sclerosis or exacerbations.	4.048682203355211
We report on unusual presentation forms of Pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with AIDS.	3.6256323331151648
A 36-years-old woman presented a cavitation in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x-ray.	3.4512828255638426
The biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on.	4.262691334173617
The surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells, focal recent and older hemorrhages, rests of fibrinous exudate and dystrophic calcifications.	2.6675076402218694
In the surrounding tissue there were Pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls, this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change.	3.3002972759262494
A cytomegalic virus infection was also found.	3.7094932625246573
In aortic atresia, coronary perfusion normally occurs through retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta.	3.269652833226901
We report on two patients with antegrade flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	2.2683006925528084
In one patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (aortic atresia, severe mitral stenosis), an intact interatrial septum/premature closure of the foramen ovale was found.	3.05563725451357
While no other way of left atrial or ventricular decompression was found, echocardiography, angiography and the post-mortem examination showed left ventricular to coronary sinusoids as the sole pathway for systemic oxygenation.	3.306840897337416
In a second patient with complex congenital heart disease, including aortic atresia, antegrade flow in the ascending aorta was through a left coronary fistula with shunt flow originating from the pulmonary trunc.	3.1880994796230797
This report describes systemic perfusion depending on retrograde coronary flow due to coronary-cameral (sinusoids) and coronary arterio-venous fistulas leading to the phenomenon of antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	2.642189955602556
However, methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported.	2.9076158357091115
With the advent of a new biosensor (Chiron Diagnostics) and a revised NOVA Biomedical device, accuracy was expected to be improved.	3.208480323537274
The goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods.	3.7325530851253563
The combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three-dimensional bone architecture.	3.178173332521778
Microcomputed tomography avoids the time-consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections.	3.404533805362787
Furthermore, its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 mm.	3.110316403223011
Thus, three-dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone.	3.5326360079245585
The aneurysmal bone cyst represents a tumorlike lesion, which does not occur frequently.	3.3970418836234546
Every site of the skeleton may be involved.	4.122723383449298
Although it can be observed at any age, it distinctly predominates from 10 to 20 years of age.	3.6603116553634973
Distinction of aneurysmatic bone cysts from certain benign or malignant bone tumours requires subtle imaging techniques and an experienced bone tumour pathologist.	3.155770064882729
Since the lesion shows a heterogeneous biological behaviour and typically occurs in the growing skeleton, a wide range of surgical procedures must be provided concerning tumour resection and defect reconstruction.	3.519645579289637
In the current retrospective study results of 41 surgically treated aneurysmal bone cysts, thereof 5 latent, 31 active, and 5 aggressive lesions, were investigated.	3.1512475922476697
While morbidity due to the therapeutic measures was comparatively low even in extended lesions and demanding reconstructions, a recurrence rate of 19.5% had to be observed in our series.	3.9654257291545254
Taking into consideration the biological activity of the lesion, analysis of the recurrences revealed inappropriate surgical margins had been chosen at the primary operation in all of these patients.	3.912906637171888
It usually presents as an acute, symmetric polysynovitis with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet.	2.7165976882663028
Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement.	3.190702079425024
We describe the case of an 81 year old man with a primarily unilateral manifestation involving the right hand.	3.0902859308019237
A thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected.	3.9515986444229076
Within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand.	3.2575175133509044
Movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful.	3.5645993778080873
Low-dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms.	3.834035246455048
The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness, safety and acceptance of a new technique of percutaneous implantation of port-catheter-systems (PIPS) for locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy of the liver.	3.3866320944648494
From October 1994 to July 1996, 128 patients (30 women, 98 men) participated in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program (phase II).	3.084450308298433
Our objectives were to demonstrate risk-factor modification and increased work-load capacity resulting directly from the rehabilitation in terms of primary results and long-term effects, 6 months (n = 59) and 12 months (n = 30) after termination of the program.	4.089379811445522
We observed how many of the patients were able to be occupationally re-integrated after completion of phase II rehabilitation.	3.7962531932491097
Here, we present the so-called "Vollmer retractor", which can be fixed on to the operating table.	4.065433357945318
It allows an optimal transference of the traction force on to the border of the wound, both in upper and lower abdominal interventions.	3.131522995159519
In this way, as shown by our recent experience, we gain an optimal view of the subdiaphragmatic area and into the small pelvis.	3.2908916963582238
The disaster management in Germany is embodied in the constitution.	3.3323479236419424
According to the German constitution the ministries of the interior of the federal states coordinate the disaster management by delegating it to the city and county administrations.	2.6125845298124757
These elaborate and update a special disaster management calendar, which allows a prompt flow of information to and from the administration and the person in charge of operations and guarantees a smooth collaboration on which the success of the operation depends.	3.361179795461516
The American-European Consensus Conference recently recommended the following criteria for diagnosis of ARDS: (1) acute onset; (2) PaO2/FiO2<=200 mmHg regardless of PEEP level; (3) bilateral infiltrates seen on frontal chest radiograph; (4) PCWP <= 18 mmHg when measured or no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension.	3.4131919066257397
Pathophysiologically, ARDS is characterized by pulmonary edema owing to injury of the capillary-alveolar membranes and increased pulmonary artery pressure.	3.603999600293107
It is further distinguished by severe hypoxemia unresponsive to the usual methods of support for respiratory failure.	2.8457603728017693
Hypoxemia is caused by intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting due to to persistent perfusion of non-ventilated alveoli.	3.60088391974595
Another characteristic feature in ARDS is the low thoracopulmonary compliance.	3.4071066966967405
Latest studies suggest that the incidence of the syndrome is in the range of 3-10 cases / 100,000 inhabitants / year.	4.338944641750319
Mortality rates are a major concern: old and new reports continue to report mortality rates of 50-60%.	3.6947490022070215
Thoracic organ transplantation has evolved as standard therapy in end-stage cardiac and pulmonary failure.	3.5591902977160164
Meanwhile more than 50.000 heart, 2500 heart-lung and 10.000 lung transplantations have been performed worldwide.	3.2460708907993756
Improvements in patient selection as well as in the postoperative management have led to 1-year survival rates of 70-90%.	4.9037509383672235
Long-term results are still influenced by the development of graft vessels disease, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and malignancies.	3.489632579761595
Furthermore, indications and results of different procecures will be presented and new developments discussed.	3.616034570517683
The paper focuses on the cultural history of brain death in Germany in the second half of the 20th century.	3.8540494800499037
It analyzes scientific and public discourses on the relevance of brain death and the importance of medical innovations in intensive care medicine.	3.566926818411368
The paper examines how the public reacted when heart transplantation led to an urgent need for a new definition of death.	3.36422894332567
It will be shown how the concept of brain death was accepted by the public, introduced into clinical routine, and implemented through medical and legal policies.	3.4967968381112633
Finally, it will be analyzed why the public consensus on brain death was definitely questioned in the last ten years.	3.172955073773974
An understanding of the use of the concept of brain death by scientists, lawyers, theologians, and the public during the last three decades may help to shed light on the social role of science in modern and late-modern societies.	4.093485165522583
Background: In the course of Graves' disease (GD) the extraocular muscles become fibrotic after an acute inflammatory stage.	3.177615112874718
Differentiation of these two stages is important for therapy.	4.310065657435755
Injuries of the joints of the pelvis and of the acetabulum are still a problem even today.	4.308592869185248
When the joints of the pelvis are damaged the risk of complicated pelvic injuries, that is to say pelvic injuries with damage to the soft tissues in and around the pelvis, is increased threefold.	3.597802980412936
The lethality, the overall gravity of the injuries, the probability of haemorrhagic complications and the proportion of associated pelvic injuries are also increased.	3.6245737244680827
Even when anatomical reconstruction of the lower limb girdle is achieved, long-term secondary conditions such as pain and genitourinary and neurological scquelae frequently persist.	3.832754262394165
Complicated pelvic injuries, i. e. pelvic injury with concomitant damage to organs and soft tissues in the pelvis and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture (floating hip) are special cases.	3.4741557018141167
Haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organic lesions must be the first priorities in the interdisciplinary therapy.	4.443958409080542
Even when these priorities are correctly observed, the lethality is almost three times as high as in the case of pelvic injuries not involving soft-tissue damage.	3.4351739462902504
Acetabular fractures are a particular challenge even compared with other joint fractures.	3.408604962711491
Operative treatment with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has been shown to have the best results.	3.518201627143141
In addition to the type of fracture and the personal experience of the surgeon concerned, such fracture-specific factors as the presence of further fractures of the posterior wall, comminuted fractures, joint depression fractures and intra-articular fragments increasingly play a part.	3.9036185305998568
The long-term result worsens with increasing number of these additional pathologies.	3.813347941305683
The primary cartilaginous damage caused by the accident seems to have a considerable influence on the long-term result following acetabular fractures.	4.267135551067804
Two-dimensional conventional X-rays and computer tomographic imaging systems contribute to the diagnosis and surgical planning of patients with orofacial malformations.	4.060794127186807
The ability to reformat CT scans into three-dimensional osseous and soft tissue surface images has a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of orofacial malformations.	3.746831477412137
Cephalometric evaluation with teleradiography provides precise insight into both the skeletal structures and the soft parts, enabling the radiologist to assess the relationship among the different parts in a given subject, at any given time and in relation to the normal.	3.3969476554999627
The purpose of this study was to check the precision of the Dräger vaporizer model 19.3 when filled with three different preparations of isoflurane.	2.6897511125450047
Background: Since there is no epidemiologic assessment of the frequency of pain caused by tumor in Germany, tumor-pain-prevalence is estimated indirectly on the basis of mortality and median survival.	4.479591296297193
Knowing that about 50% of all patients having metastases or incurable locoregional recurrence suffer from pain every day, the product of median survival times mortality was calculated to achieve the number of patients' days with tumor-caused pain per year (82.710.690 days in Germany 1995).	3.568148392189392
By division with 365 (days), it is calculated that 226.605 patients require tumor pain related treatment at one day in Germany.	3.4075414161081308
Another calculation based on Bonica's publications that 60-90% of patients suffering from advanced cancer are having pain and based on an estimated tumor prevalence 1989/90 revealed a tumor pain prevalence of 221.826.	3.373433927213733
Laser catheters which run eccentrically on a guide wire were developed for maximization of luminal gain by excimer laser angioplasty (ELCA).	2.844656717771163
We investigated the safety and efficacy of ELCA with these new catheters plus PTCA in patients with restenoses or occlusions in coronary stents.	3.290760242540489
The age of standardized instrumented scoliosis correction and stabilization began with Harrington instrumentation (HI).	2.7783971239435545
With HI, satisfactory long-term correction of the frontal plane averaged approximately 50 %, but without notable derotational capabilities.The distraction of the concavity leads to reduction of the sagittal contour of the spine (flat back), which is biomechanically disadvantageous.	3.9554117026938704
The newer multisegmentally attached implant systems avoid this disadvantage.	2.882886931255539
The first prototypes of these systems were Luque- (SSI) and Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation.	2.918547169617492
However, even with these newer doublerod systems derotation is low, because derotation is, without any doubt, related to anterior release and thus decoupling of the segments by means of disc resection.	3.2983752779016253
Autoaggressive syndromes as causes of diseases underlying chronic blepharitis and keratoconjunctivitis that are refractory to treatment are often difficult to recognize.	3.292725836059526
The surgical correction of a tandem stenosis of the carotid artery is sometimes difficult, especially if the second stenosis is near or above the skull base.	3.5577895324679925
Angioplasty and Stent implantation may offer an alternative to standard surgical procedures in the treatment of carotid stenoses in the future.	4.432418602512668
However, the potential advantages of these endovascular techniques warrant continued evaluation.	3.3423472687886395
The application of these techniques in carotid artery tandem stenoses presents specific problems and dangers.	2.901658497518893
We discuss the case of a 78-year-old man with severe carotid stenoses on both sides and an additional symptomatic tandem stenosis above the skull base on the right side.	3.2639786075453396
After the surgical correction of the left carotid artery using standard endarterectomy, we performed endarterectomy on the right side in combination with an open Stent implantation.	4.518946151956005
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis are also known as Koenen tumors.	2.7527923182089595
Joannes Henricus Maria Koenen was born on March 10, 1893, in Eindhoven and died in Bois-le-Duc May 29, 1956.	2.6500497504560014
Then he worked as a physician at the "Coudewater" asylum in Rosmalen and from 1929 in the "Voorburg" asylum in Vught.	2.6545236936257273
In 1932 he published his publication concerning a family with tuberous sclerosis in which photographs of periungual fibromas are shown.	2.845639629337736
His thesis in 1933 at the University in Leiden was titled "Imbecility in children.	3.1220143956414335
Its Importance in pedagogic and social regard, by reason of an investigation in some communities in Noord-Brabant".	2.963846357088823
Later he was appointed director of a state mental institution.	3.0967427191709684
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis were first described by Richad Kothe in Munich in 1903.	2.5555366078194877
Parallel with the increasing number of coronary stent implantation procedures, new or more elaborate coronary stents were introduced into clinical use almost every month in 1996.	3.4914960782079194
We have studied the architecture, surface-morphology, and shape-conversion of 16 different coronary stent systems.	2.9489679839038594
The objective of our study was to detect possible specific design and surface features which might influence the healing process, instent restenosis, and stent thrombosis.	3.2144972012619784
Using electron microscopy we found ultrasmooth surfaces on 5 stents.	2.9054956255625877
Video-based morphometry showed covering between 8.3% and 26.4%.	3.0152763497989623
Stent shortening after in-vitro expansion ranged from 0% up to 10.5% of the initial stent length.	3.5572764737797775
In some stent systems balloon dilation lead to over-expansion of the stent margaine.	3.058201745836918
This over-expansion mounted up to 20% of the balloon diameter and the stents revealed a rather biconcave than homogenous expansion pattern.	3.234476614893556
This phenomenon was also found after postmortal stent implantation in 20 autopsied hearts.	3.25357839864931
Unilateral hearing loss (HL) caused by an acoustic neuroma (AN) is regarded to be neural ("non-cochlear").	3.328601943103528
By using otoacoustic emissions it is possible to prove concurrent sensory (cochlear) HL.	2.944298560394519
We prefer distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) because these are more frequency-specific and stable.	2.8451522428756784
From April 1994 to May 1996, we examined preoperatively 24 patients with radiologically proven AN.	3.522580081222787
Pure-tone audiometry, DP-grams, brainstem-evoked response audiometry (BERA) and vestibular studies were performed in all cases, while special auditory tests (Fowler, Carhart) and short increment sensitivity indices were also performed in 12 cases.	3.2045039287204973
BERA was pathological in 23 cases and latencies were borderline in one case.	3.266374888135599
After comparing audiograms and DP-grams we found 13 patients with sensory HL, 4 patients with combined sensorineural HL and 7 patients with neural HL.	3.4305560682199503
There was a strong correlation between the results of DPOAE and the results of special auditory test (=0.63) whereas there was no correlation between tumor size and cochlear function.	4.119056133659585
The result showed that the typical HL caused by AN was a combined sensorineural loss.	3.2874544105582717
DPOAE were not suited for the detection of AN but were able to give exact information about any remaining cochlear function.	3.746209160646382
The monoclonal dominant malignant T cells in mycosis fungoides (MF) carry identical TCR rearrangements.	2.8791315000471687
Their detection is a useful diagnostic tool.	3.844993346599377
Thus, in routine diagnosis we investigated the occurrence of monoclonal T cells in skin biopsy samples of MF-patients by TCR-PCR, followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE).	3.3668584577236103
In 188 out of 208 MF patients, at least one skin sample with sufficient DNA quality for PCR analysis was obtained.	3.3602330736101695
Applying a consensus PCR for the TCR genes VI and J 1/2, we detected monoclonal T cells in 122 cases (65%).	3.0294000930862715
Here we found in 11 cases (6%) predominant clonal rearrangements of VII-IV and J 1/2 and in 2 (1%) those of VI-IV and J P1/2.	3.6471166439265934
In patients with MF, detecting rearrangements of only VI and J 1/2 is sufficient for PCR screening analysis.	2.7044532179373824
In 53 of the patients (28%) the applied methods revealed no monoclonal T cells.	3.824579576024157
This may be due to a low cell number, oligoclonal nature, chromosomal abberations or remaining of TCR in germline configuration.	2.9752172790659612
Despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children, a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification.	3.2309063929197426
The aim of our retrospective cross-sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection.	3.484967870819109
The parents of 70 hearing-impaired children were interviewed.	3.3135926779002984
All children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities.	3.2220250128604127
At an average age of 19.5 months, parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment.	3.5456721432814304
On average it then took an additional 7.2 months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation (fitting of hearing aids).	3.112224510289099
Significantly, total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments.	2.92695352929347
In addition to hearing loss, parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation.	3.0885884119102234
Statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing-impaired close relatives as well as first-born children tended to be diagnosed later.	3.7914070186864035
To further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss, the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration.	3.088495730313215
After the incidental puncture of a sidebranch of the thyreocervical trunk during a subclavian vein catheterization, a symptomatic av-fistula developped.	2.7965858138424267
The diagnosis was confirmed by angiography.	3.3794571982067536
Using a microcatheter system the fistula was occluded with microcoils.	3.0706287204922704
This prospective study was designed to compare quality of life, life satisfaction, and subjective ratings of health before and at variable time intervals after heart transplantation (HTx).	3.2159325669226453
175 patients were included between February 1994 and December 1997.	4.1861497011767
Every six months before and 1,5, 3, 6, and 12 months after HTx, they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires: German SF 36, heart failure and specific transplant symptom list, global quality of life assessment, Munich life quality dimension list, expected/experienced life changes after HTx, good command of the German language, and a minimum age of 18 years.	4.074535607897953
Quality of life was rated as very poor by 84% of patients with congestive heart failure.	2.979187425753073
Only 6 weeks after HTx, 74% rated their quality of life as significantly better.	3.7875917911659442
Six weeks after HTx, this parameter improved significantly and 76% were very satisfied about their health status and 50% about physical performance.	3.121986324219333
While somatic changes expected before HTx corresponded well with experienced ones, psychological improvements were smaller than expected, but one year after HTx they were significant (before: M=3.66; SD=0.9; Range (R)=3.78 vs 12 months postop: M=4.61; SD=0.6; R=2.67; p<0.05).	2.689325012024554
Quality of life correlated before HTx best with subjectively rated health (r=0.61, p<0.01) and 6 months after with satisfaction about health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).	3.0040461736320836
Only in 25% were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity/satisfaction, professional situation, and recreational activities.	2.8087903243221004
90% of posttransplant patients reported physical compaints, most by effects of immunsuppression, but were coping well.	3.0931635770780597
The study shows that already 6 weeks after successful HTx all quality of life parameters improved significantly.	3.822439665723973
Despite some unfulfilled expectations and complaints, the postoperative life situation of HTx patients appeared significantly improved.	2.961398256094185
Owing to its lower blood-gas solubility coefficient, emergence from anaesthesia is faster with sevoflurane than with isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane.	3.035681177496891
Sevoflurane undergoes metabolic biodegradation, releasing inorganic fluoride ions that could produce nephrotoxicity.	2.863547038865684
In this study, we compared serum inorganic fluoride concentrations (IFCs) in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane.	2.940705070742302
Background: Rarely, an additional Brown's syndrome develops spontaneously in cases of posttraumatic bilateral superior oblique palsy.	3.402632060667486
Surgical measures are controversial and problematic.	3.3986712570370314
Metastasis formation is a multistep process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages.	3.3366055091818736
One of the first steps is a disturbance of the epithelial integrity through a decrease in intercellular homotypic adhesion.	3.7068368142319303
Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, as well as increased locomotion, leads to intravasation and dissemination of the tumor cells.	4.5267666511362155
In the target organs metastasizing cells adhere to the endothelium, extravasate and form metastases.	2.787548338575101
Finally, neoangiogenesis is required for the initiation as well as the growth of the metastases, providing the tumor cells with both nutritive agents and growth factors.	4.0264825672452895
This leads to the conclusion that anti-proteolytic and anti-angiogenic substances could provide effective therapeutic approaches for the control of metastatic growth.	3.216228362579828
Whether or not this goal can be accomplished by synthetic or endogenous drugs must still be demonstrated by basic and definitive clinical research.	3.0335024745262062
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint.	3.429822186104448
Urodynamic examinations were performed in 82 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before and after radical prostatectomy.	4.038482548023497
A significant decrease in bladder capacity (396 ml to 331.9 ml), urethral closure pressure (89.6 cm H2O to 65.,2 cm H2O) and functional profile length (61 mm to 25.9 mm) was noted.	3.0499478501500517
The continence rate after radical prostatectomy was 33.4 % after 1 month, 69.4 % after 3 months, 84.7 % after 6 months, and 90.9 % after 12 months, respectively.	3.6852256162202086
A correlation was found between urethral closure pressure and functional profile length and continence.	3.190977906293662
A second urodynamic examination was performed 6 months after radical prostatectomy.	3.444053497105908
Functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased.	3.477008802588331
These data suggest that restoration of continence is based on sphincteric parameters.	3.238977688569578
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound with biological tissue with regard to cancer therapy.	3.7785213946986773
The physical and biological aspects of this are reviewed and summarized in this paper.	3.5684448530278363
The preliminary results give reason to hope, as ultrasound is easy to focuse and might be applicable as a supplementary therapeutic technique in ultrasound-accessible tumors.	3.0816655596948728
The changes observed in biological studies are clearly a function of the pyhsical parameters.	3.1887846441964838
Therefore, it is possible to calculate and predict the biological effects.	3.2417945045041603
Recent results have shown the potential of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring ultrasound therapy online.	3.9533381612444667
The capability of MRI to measure temperature will be an important tool for the safe and reliable application of this new therapeutic approach.	3.92786400999081
The role of ultrasound therapy in the management of human tumors must be clarified in carefully conducted clinical trials.	3.3419720243282587
Posttraumatic deformities after pediatric fractures are either the result of incomplete or failed remodeling, complete or partial stimulation of the growth plates, or complete or partial closure of a growth plate.	3.538949740990416
In contrast to fractures of the upper extremities, spontaneous remodeling should not be intentionally integrated in the treatment algorithm.	4.3535707278721025
In the context of the quality assurance program of the German pension insurance institutions, instruments and procedures have been developed in the past few years in order to assess the quality of structure, process, and results of inpatient rehabilitation, as well as patient satisfaction.	4.693491586333149
The routine implementation of these procedures aims at providing rehabilitation hospitals with fast information on shortcomings in their current practice, so that concepts of treatment and - in the long run - effects of rehabilitation can be systematically improved.	3.646374965747469
When the "quality profiles" of rehabilitation hospitals are compared ("benchmarking"), paying institutions of rehabilitation could gain information on the cost-quality-ratio of particular hospitals as well as important leads for improving the steering processes of patients and hospitals.	3.6146981742869073
In the present article, results of a first "field-run" of the procedures for measuring patient satisfaction and quality of rehabilitation processes are reported.	3.811022335369122
A comparative analysis of patient satisfaction in four orthopaedic/rheumatologic rehabilitation hospitals showed high degrees of overall satisfaction in all hospitals.	3.093832120026988
In several subdimensions of patient satisfaction, however, significant differences between hospitals were found.	4.406089618576545
Quality of rehabilitation processes - as assessed by a standardized peer-review - varied substantially between 36 hospitals.	3.1154446573340837
Problems of quality were found especially in some dimensions that must be considered as crucial for rehabilitation, e.g., in the history and diagnosis of disabilities, in the consideration of psycho-social problems, or in the assessment of occupational capacities.	4.178565187091406
The analysis of THR-failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement.	3.7583574700000275
The acetabular cup fails more often than the stem.	3.4919007590793507
In the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups.	3.174650101757293
The known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases exponentially 8 to 10 years after implantation, could of course not be seen in this study.	3.4461060120116356
The success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, age over 70 and the fixation manner: the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of pressfit cups although the Zweymüller-cup as well as the Link type V-cup showed good results.	3.5079872629598867
The midterm results of the stem were very good for the cementless as for the cemented technique.	3.722657546142021
The further implantation should be thought of, what partially has already happened.	3.001365887694638
The results of cementless stem fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis and dysplastic osteoarthritis is comparable, so that cementless fixation should be thought of in case of adequate conditions (ability of partial weight bearing for some weeks, age under 60).	3.6400295336734794
Type I and type II diabetes are the most common types of diabetes.	4.102595957755787
The ratio of type I to type II diabetes is about 1:9.	3.9274946753279694
Type I diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes.The disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence ("juvenile diabetes"), although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed.	3.375443205205171
Morphologically, a subtotal ( > 80 %) to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic islets occurs.	3.505256767275768
Lymphocytic insulitis, which disappears after the beta cells have been totally destroyed, is pathognomonic of type I diabetes.	3.2547399078368446
This insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors.	3.5213278898848444
An important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition (HLA DR3/DR4/DQ8) in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors (e. g., viruses).	3.2704169914381214
Autoantibodies, such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and/or autoantibodies to the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid carboxylase (GAD), are already detectable in a prediabetic phase, although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestion.	3.9416389497670896
The course of the disease is dependent on age.	3.821687201505556
Young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults.	2.93009128183714
This article summarizes data from recent studies on the prevalence, diagnosis and therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.	3.962954725705307
The prevalence of this disorder in 4-6 year old children is 0.7%.	4.078104069999292
Leading clinical sign in 90% of patients is habitual snoring, but this is rather nonspecific, as 60% of patients investigated for habitual snoring do not have OSAS.	3.674578615198811
Other signs such as daytime sleepiness, failure to thrive, profuse nocturnal sweating or mouth breathing are equally nonspecific.	2.830695617889894
The diagnosis, therefore, has to be confirmed by polysomnography, where OSAS is suggested by the occurrence of >5 obstructive apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep in conjunction with a CO2 of >50 mmHg for >8% of sleep time and/or >1 desaturation to <=90%/h.	3.9174834160799947
Patients with progressive cancer and their families face a series of existential crises with each stage of disease up to terminal stages in which palliative treatment is begun, and patients come to accept the inevitability of death.	3.1056088374139756
This can lead to a unique, highly emotional situation with direct or indirect, open or hidden, varied and very personal manifestations.	2.9691169130015407
The dermatological clinic in Homburg was founded in 1945.	3.121627634106338
In 1947 it was integrated into the Saarland University as a dermatology department.	3.103090186119253
A review of the history of the clinic documents advances and challenges in clinical dermatology, as well as new developments in related basic research during the last 50 years.	3.541848484985569
The coexistence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease occurs in a small percentage of patients requiring open heart surgical procedures.	4.047434217198992
Whether the combined surgical approach favorably influences the outcome of patients requiring major cardiac operations remains controversial.	3.4336479632340007
We report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery.	2.745225168479979
A 33-year-old woman suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after treatment with FSH/HCG for in-vitro fertilization.	3.5062601569379455
She developed a transient left hemiparesis.	3.26258591562319
This was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery.	3.8839474469741857
Open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms.	3.5968015057625613
The development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in housewives.	3.034874877342492
In 1986 we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife.	3.0946311077311464
Now, we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the household and grade them in comparison to the data of 1986.	3.570773695888755
The results are based on the analysis of a large population of 2633 patients with the occupation "housewife" and the diagnosis "eczema" who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK).	3.581753222635095
Data for HIV infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality.	3.01743226928378
Estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic, even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk.	4.117689325497869
Extrapolations of data from discordant couple cohort studies and from US seroincidence studies may be seriously biased.	2.9702836703734627
Infectivity of and susceptibility to HIV may be influenced by concomitant STDs, antiretroviral therapy, alloimmunization and/or subinfectious virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter- and intraindividual variability.	3.317066345663961
Differences in factors influencing transmission probability of HIV most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of HIV.	2.939629839220825
Between January 1989 and March 1997, 175 patients with traumatic shoulder dislocations were treated by conservative means (median age 41 years, 39 F, 136 M).	3.3210543615625148
In 78 patients (17 F, 61 M) a clinical and radiological follow up (median 50 months, range 6-106) could be obtained.	3.6630638756237466
Additionally, a diagnostic ultrasound was carried out in all patients.	3.2488739107275366
The recurrence rate in the group younger than 30 years (G < 30; n = 35) was 86 %; in the group older than 30 years (G > 30; n = 43) it was 21 % (P < 0.05).	3.2047468753301347
Persisting neurological deficits were found in 6 patients (8 %).	4.39923009334374
According to the Rowe score, 16 patients (46 %) of the G < 30 achieved excellent or good results, in the G > 30, 29 patients (67 %).	4.318444108386687
In 17 % of cases, a glenohumeral arthrosis was diagnosed be radiological means.	3.429062817651159
18 % had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity.	4.0985968430208475
Hill-Sachs lesions were identified in 19 % of cases.	3.9285581596425896
Rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in 9 % by ultrasound.	3.6419023864918976
No relationship between the duration of immobilization and the recurrence rate was found (P = 0.95).	3.781447029403912
The recurrence rate following primary shoulder dislocation depends primarily on the patients' age.	3.286354140185456
We analyzed quality assurance protocol records of 532 geriatric hospital patients in comparison to an administration database concerning data on "length of stay" information (LOS).	3.2211871909722034
Doctors handwritten quality assurance protocol records corresponded in 74.25% of cases to administration data.	3.0072195489593123
14.47% of cases were registered with different LOS; 11.28% of LOS information was missing.	3.4559316638210107
The increasing amount of documentation tasks in German geriatric hospitals is discussed.	2.9979111467422372
Conclusion: We assume that not only discrete well known information (admission and discharge dates, LOS) are contaminated by documentation failure but also data on functional status of geriatric patients which may have important influence on external data processing.	3.1418379216146968
The majority of patients with symptomatic spondylolysis can be treated conservatively.	3.7917110989966196
Only when symptoms persist in spite of conservative treatment surgery may be indicated.	3.5685968665016112
In young patients, however, fusion of a mobile segment should be avoided, but a direct repair of the pars defect can be attempted.	4.702401839802881
This procedure allows complete healing and possibly avoids degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	2.9009022888337404
For this purpose Morscher developed the hook screw, which connects the arch with the anterior articular process.	2.7222943806670146
It allows compression of the defect without crossing the defect with the screw.	3.7038526645593404
A follow-up study of the first 33 patients with a follow-up time of 3.5 years on average showed a good subjective result in 79 % of the patients.	4.554628127662635
In patients younger than 20 years of age, however, the result was good in 87.5 % of cases.	4.2666072505121395
The reason for the better results in young patients is that in older patients the origin of the pain is often not the pars defect, but the degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	4.219922860803903
Direct repair of spondylolysis is therefore indicated when pain persists after 6 months of conservative treatment or there is a progressive olisthesis of not more than 10 mm.	3.74243789553295
After the end of growth an MRI study of the intervertebral discs should show whether there is degeneration or not.	3.628483169895268
Direct repair is indicated only in the absence of disc degeneration.	4.284552178371653
After the age of 25 years this procedure should not be carried out.	4.131057933300582
We are presenting a 47-year-old woman who was stung by jellyfish while bathing in the sea of Thailand.	2.66230271033607
Immediately after the injury she developed sharp pain and urticarial erythema of the skin of the knees accompanied by muscle cramps of the entire body.	3.590068501766397
After a few days a toxic contact dermatitis with edematous swelling and ulcerations developed, which did not respond to topical antibiotics or corticosteroids.	3.3769061506211657
Three weeks later the patient presented with a disseminated urticarial eruption, which at first responded well to topical treatment and systemic corticosteroids.	3.4422601966905635
Over the next few weeks, however, a relapse of the eruption and the ulcerations occurred.	3.7104065409217033
Raised titres of IgG and IgM antibodies against different jellyfish from the Indian and Pacific Ocean were detected in the patient's serum by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.	3.153648886575802
Antibodies against bees (class 1) and wasps (class 4) were found by the radioallergosorbent test.	3.6701060824635423
First aid and secondary treatment of jellyfish injuries are suggested.	3.24510054643403
The design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task.	3.611114164727408
In particular in ICD trials, false estimations and omissions have occured that can compromise the interpretation of a trial.	3.1264862585037694
Identification of crucial issues that should be regulated in a study protocol in order to minimize the risk of failure.	4.2350523268874065
Evaluation of the weaknesses of completed antiarrhythmic trials.	2.802829851327975
Problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs.	3.6465565281141012
Further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared.	3.5284245287154614
Technical mistakes as imprecise definitions, arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial, unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol.	3.2903199062957973
A prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is drafted is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial.	3.686817600604183
Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation.	3.1572103137114085
Simple B-mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures, while color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion.	3.3994854221300748
More recent technical advances such as power Doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation.	3.2141869045428595
The possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts.	4.427343795982289
Purpose: The first morphological changes in eyes with HIV infection are microvascular disease of the retina with cotton-wool spots and microaneurysms.	3.1767641238688893
The study was performed to find out if evidence of disturbances of ocular microcirculation can be established by non-invasive methods.	4.04586721758527
The operative realignment of mechanical axis deviations (MAD) is necessary to prevent early joint degeneration and to reach normal load-bearing.	3.4012887439755586
Modern types of external fixation systems allow an alignment of the mechanical axis to exact degrees.	3.336738206143348
Predominantly this are corrections of angular deformities.	3.344689093561122
In some cases the analysis of the MAD does not show any angular deformity, but a parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines of a bone.	3.4619484122534883
Such parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines is defined as a translation deformity of the bone.	3.1930733526721853
In combined deformities with angulation and translation the centre of deformity can be established proximal or distal out of the limit of the bone.	3.5422507304072366
In translation deformities the realignment of the mechanical axis requires a parallel re-staggering made by a translation-osteotomy or by a counterangulated double osteotomy.	3.009107969907693
In complex deformities with angulation and translation, the translation requires a separate corrective planning.	2.784422815562366
By using external fixator systems to perform acute or progressive corrective osteotomies the position of the Axis of Correction of Angulation (ACA) in relation to the n-CORA of the deformity has to be considered.	3.0291808687305775
If ACA position is not conform with the n-CORA position relevant geometric effects in relation of length and translation occur.	2.931010687227237
These geometric effects to corrective osteotomies can be calculated by using simple trigonometric formulas or graphical methods.	2.862644130889791
The employers' liability insurance association for victuallers and licensed victuallers has been controlling healing procedures with the aid of a computer program for several years.	2.805982133536546
The personal data of the injured patient and the precise diagnosis of the injury are used to prepare a forecast of the duration of the treatment and of the patient's inability to work.	5.64059281354204
The basis of this forecast is provided by tables integrated in the program, which have been elaborated by experts on trauma medicine and also constantly refined by them.	3.302191324326292
Meanwhile numerous insurance companies concerned with accidents and trauma have acquired the program and are intending to use it.	3.0454802214249614
The objective is a national database on trauma medicine covering the whole of Germany.	2.88768266125731
It is intended that its evaluation will help to guarantee the quality of concomitant treatment of trauma victims and also yield some indications on how best to realize the networking of institutions concerned with acute treatment and rehabilitation.	3.1795459712752403
Stroke and its consequences are under medical, sociologic and socioeconomic aspects one of the biggest contemporary challenges.	3.5615356106632845
Due to the demographic development the importance of this disease will further increase.	3.9319716473920736
Nonetheless acute therapy of ischemic stroke up to now was marked by therapeutic nihilism and adherence to empiric therapeutic procedures.	3.3521142209008024
Only the admission of rt-Pa in the USA in 1996 for the systemic thrombolysis in ischemic insults less then 3 hours old led to a change in therapeutic strategies.	3.3337021239854097
The good profit-risk-ratio of early thrombolysis with rt-Pa could be confirmed by further studies lately.	3.469894685252432
In Europe thrombolysis is equally promoted as the procedure of choice.	3.237482833608454
At present only few patients receive such a treatment.	3.3612840372508033
A thrombolytic therapy can only be provided by a minority of centers due to high requirement in infra-structure.	3.436527261893128
Furthermore clinic admission often appears with immense loss of time.	2.9798759692179986
Unfortunately also within the clinics there are relevant latencies until therapeutic intervention.	3.1637642026465778
Therefore fundamental requirements for thrombolytic therapy are the indentification of potentially suitable patients and the rapid transfer to an appropriate clinic.	3.504803455285906
A 69-year-old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non-small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus, pulmonary artery and left atrium.	4.028482507017626
Using cardiopulmonary bypass, an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed.	4.106900206720356
The cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch.	3.306516395768898
After a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence 2.5 years postoperatively.	3.590034380176911
In this retrospective study we report the indications, complications and functional and cosmetic results after dermofat grafting into anophthalmic orbits.	3.2836425845955444
The method consists of implantation of autogenous dermis with attached subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region into the orbit.	2.865420929742636
Twenty-four primary and 4 secondary grafts were implanted in 28 patients aged 12 to 49 years.	3.26822668677742
In the explantation site one patient showed delayed healing.	2.995507425380802
All implants became integrated, none were lost because of infection or extrusion.	3.346074835474353
Eleven patients developed minor complications like central ulceration in the dermis, hair growth on the dermis or suture granuloma.	2.949756272501801
In the primary implant group the functional and cosmetic outcome was evaluated by measurements of the lid structures, exophthalmometry (Hertel) and measuring the prosthesis motility (Kestenbaum).	3.2074799750273697
Despite the more extensive surgery and some minor complications the safety of this method with good functional and cosmetic results makes dermofat grafting an excellent alternative to heterogenous orbital implants.	3.205792275743184
Liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; stages I-IV) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen-presenting cells.	3.355540723715256
Dendritic cells (DCs) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti-S 100 protein and KiMlp antibodies.	3.443110563005643
We confirm previous findings that, in early PBC, S 100 protein-positive DCs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia.	3.503877452299637
However, the present study disclosed that S 100 protein- and KiMlp-positive DCs regularly occur in piecemeal necroses (PMNs) developing in PBC-associated chronic hepatitis.	3.0262445851528694
DCs in PMNs were observed in all PBC stages, but were most prominent in late-stage PBC.	4.091176176570513
These findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in PBC may not be limited to bile ducts, but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma, producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity.	3.054434330375416
Health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a humane society, the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies.	3.2997999453321527
The ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics.	3.3158735034566247
Their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to dilemmas characteristic of emergency care.	3.4224528587585294
Due to dwindling resources, the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized.	3.452780731508763
Possibilities of rationalizing care without compromising its quality are being discussed, such as renouncing futile therapy and implementing measures of prevention.	3.270266633475925
If emergency medical services are to accomplish their mission, however, observing standards of medical practice, legal provisions, and the given framework of society, they must not surrender to pure cost containment.	3.630160628817692
We performed a phase II trial with second-line chemotherapy in patients with refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder.	4.042188843038995
Second-line therapy consists of 2.6 cycles of mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid.	3.479772693743936
Two patients suffered from WHO grade III side effects (nephrotoxicity, leukocytopenia).	3.3902146978166536
Four patients had a stable disease; 3.3 months after therapy, patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of 9 months.	3.900637978790623
Four patients reported an improvement in quality of life.	3.3335577146581943
Since all patients received supportive care, improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone.	3.5643124922296923
Every form of active euthanasia is a punishable offence under § 216 of the Penal Code; nor is there any ethical justification for it from a medical point of view.	2.742540266423188
The many strands of the movement in favour of making "death on demand" exempt from punishment in Germany as it is in The Netherlands cannot change this.	3.1275510893565874
The oral retinoid etretinate (Tigason) has recently been replaced by trans-acitretin (Neotigason) in the treatment of severe psoriasis, primarily because of its short half-life and the assumption that a shorter period of subsequent contraception would be required.	3.7469583315588753
After introduction of the new drug, however, circulating quantities of etretinate were detected in patients treated with trans-acitretin.	4.1774282939440965
Thus far, re-esterification has been detected in at least 83 cases.	3.6583644558923236
The 2-month period of strict contraception initially recommended after oral intake of trans-acitretin has been extended to 2 years, as with etretinate.	3.253350468938981
We review some aspects of trans-acitretin metabolism, with special emphasis on etretinate formation.	3.333723408951809
Re-esterification of trans-acitretin into etretinate takes place under varying conditions in volunteers and patients, as well as in animal models.	3.511250999166889
Ethanol is a co-factor for the enzymatic re-esterification of trans-acitretin.	2.9967835274587
It is unclear whether the introduction of trans-acitretin has been of any significant benefit to patients.	3.3058748524628174
Monitoring of plasma retinoid levels during and after retinoid therapy remains of decisive importance in managing difficult cases and or in approving decisions for pregnancy.	2.9705539825157934
The purpose of this study was to compare the midterm results of the conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures in athletes.	3.0093289054425356
During 1989 and 1990, 279 athletes with ACL ruptures were treated in our Sports Surgery Department, and 221 of them were suitable for inclusion in the study.	3.2084403184734187
The patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of ACL rupture had been  made.	3.2997961672619605
Group I (n = 129) underwent ACL reconstruction using free bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, while group II (n = 92) received conservative treatment.	3.3331806945162663
We were able to evaluate 92 patients during follow-up (42 from group I and 50 from group II).	3.5617502942120605
The average follow-up period was 86 months.	3.08216026895533
There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients' age, sex, or level of sports activity.	3.064353125356066
Follow-up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients.	3.7091630487038274
During follow-up, we used IKDC and OAK scores to evaluate the results.	3.752337172457023
We found significantly better results in the group that was operated on if the patients took part in high-risk pivoting sports, but there was no difference if the patients were in the low-risk or no-risk pivoting group of athletes.	4.739398774621346
Concerning reoperation and early arthrosis, the difference was significant between the two groups.	3.473064785186604
Background: By depletion of stratospheric ozone, enhanced levels of UV radiation reach the surface of the earth.	2.940120331137389
Exposure of the anterior parts of the eye to UV radiation leads to irritation of the conjunctival and corneal cells.	3.655247944869334
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a low field strength MRI unit (0.2 T; Esaote, Biomedica) and a high field strength MRI unit (1.5 T; Siemens) in detecting meniscal lesions.	2.8449766716767346
Twenty patients were investigated on a 0.2-T low-field MRI unit and a 1.5-T high-field MRI unit for meniscal lesions.	3.388194775744926
Evaluation was performed of four meniscal compartments (anterior and posterior medial and lateral meniscus), for a total of 80 observations.	3.9436087834150992
The reliability of diagnosis was ranked qualitatively on a three-point scale.	3.3203941802942025
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 58 observations and with moderate confidence in 22 observations.	2.4055710251476277
Investigations of the low-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 5 patients and ruled out tears in 15 patients.	3.4448913908154775
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 39 observations, with moderate confidence in 38 observations, and with low confidence in 3 observations.	2.625344389292902
The diagnosis in high- and low-field images was identical in 98.7 % of cases; in one patient observations from the high-field unit changed the therapeutic management.	4.174722006536194
Low field strength MR imaging shows comparatively high diagnostic accuracy for meniscal lesions compared to high field strength imaging; however, we demonstrated a significantly higher confidence in diagnosis with high-field MR imaging.	3.74667907217442
The past decade has seen the successful application of genetic techniques in the dissection of the most important phenotypes of cancer cells.	3.912372439248284
In the case of drug resistance mechanisms, the elucidation of the genes involved in resistance to anticancer agents has led to new and unexpected information about tumor physiology and may well open therapeutic options by virtue of reversing clinical chemoresistance.	2.9205088055995954
The experimental characterization of defined multidrug resistance factors, such as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance associated protein, topoisomerase, or glutathione-S-transferase in urologic malignancies, is now relatively comprehensive, allowing for an initial analysis.	2.9621652790255197
Clinical studies on some of these concepts have been started and will be the subject of careful scrutinity.	3.4710131901135868
We expect that they will have a considerable impact on the way certain urologic anticancer strategies will be pursued in the future.	3.2477846697578707
A study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery.	4.551670830221691
A total of 1103 impacted lower wisdom teeth and 3 impacted lower second molars were removed in 687 patients, all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively.	2.6644506969716115
Clinical, radiological, and surgical factors of each case were recorded.	3.8931003713939467
Postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination.	3.5010529844762415
Follow-up was carried out for a maximum of 35 weeks.	3.875090060685786
The lingual nerve was injured in 2.1% of patients.	3.1230747380840818
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0.91%, and of the lingual nerve in 0.37%.	3.2908047756595775
However, the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general.	3.239856876291835
The effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed.	4.083120487693074
For the inferior alveolar nerve, analysis revealed significant effects in older patients, for completely developed roots, for deeply impacted teeth, in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal, for difficult surgery, and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve.	3.709286539921792
The surgeon and the anesthesia had a significant influence on lingual dysesthesia.	3.201172679656279
Background: This review of radiological and other procedures used in the diagnosis of (chronic) low-back pain is not intended to provide a complete evaluation of the methods employed, because the validity, specificity and sensitivity of the various diagnostic measures are the subject of so much controversy that a comprehensive discussion would be beyond the scope of the present overview.	4.488323898940334
The choice of method depends not only on the clinical symptoms but also on the localisation of the pain, the aetiology of which may also be related to the age of the patient.	4.157328898906021
Enteritis and pseudoappendicitis are typical manifestations of Yersinia infections in children.	3.1831258004377783
We found specific antibodies against Yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat-edly in the patients' serum.	3.5128632152868517
The present study investigates patients' expectations toward radiotherapy and their associations to quality of life and physician judgements.	3.0408399243441013
Fifty-five patients with tumors of different sites (30 with previous tumor-related surgery, 25 without surgery) admitted to the department of radiotherapy filled out a standardized questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, PLC by Siegrist et al., therapy-related expectations and success) before and after inpatient radiotherapy.	3.208037977525902
The corresponding physician ratings were collected.	3.2042342453446384
Fifty-eight percent of the patients expected the therapeutic goal "healing", whereas from the physician's standpoint this was realistic in only 7 % of cases.	3.5122399318108775
The specific radiotherapy-related expectations "tumor control" and "pain relief" reached almost the same levels in patients and physician (71 % vs 71 % and 40 % vs 44 %).	3.37640842343637
Patients with healing expectancy reported higher quality of life at the beginning of the therapy (53.4 % vs 39.9 %); patients expecting pain relief reported lower quality of life (37.1 % vs 54.5 %).	3.199964444954006
Surgical patients who had been operated on within the past year (n = 18) showed a particularly high healing expectancy (83 %), whereas patients whose operation dated back more than 1 year focused on pain relief as therapeutic goal (83 %).	3.7202684760271025
The surgeon, as the primary contact person for patients, can influence patients' therapy-related expectations.	3.838648399642981
In explaining the overall therapeutic strategy, surgeons should also mention the scope and limits of adjuvant therapies.	3.11366209878844
The meanings of the terms "quality", "quality of care", and "quality management" were clarified with common international definitions.	3.4622553062632044
Based on that, the basic ideas, concepts, and objectives of quality management in medicine were explained.	3.455731496361103
Finally some future trends related to quality were viewed, which represent challenges for the medical profession and entire medicine.	3.2398827941278348
The papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS) was first described in 1990 by Harms et al.	2.298612904058912
The syndrome is characterised by fever, an itchy erythema with edema, confluent papules and purpura of the hands and feet in a "gloves and socks" distribution.	3.0545401353965467
The skin lesions may be associated with purpura and superficial erosions of the oral mucosa.	3.7190156925331515
Viral infections, in particular parvovirus B19, are the most likely trigger.	4.725058703504172
In the present case PPGSS developed after taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.	2.6030663951458757
Since the patient developed identical symptoms after accidental re-challenge with the same drug, this case strongly suggests medications as another factor in the pathogenesis of PPGSS.	3.630473237271091
Most fractures of the clavicle heal well with nonoperative treatment.	4.113151811221511
On rare occasions, malunited clavicular fractures are associated with a pattern of disability that includes not only pain but also functional or neurovascular impairment.	3.197609153042629
In these cases, clavicular osteotomy and correction of the deformity should be considered.	2.9977266842692427
In four patients with a malunited fracture of the clavicle following nonoperative treatment, we performed a clavicular osteotomy for deformity.	4.009462868648261
In all four patients the clavicular fracture healed with shortening associated with pain and ipsilateral glenohumeral dysfunction.	2.9081032122661963
The deformity was not associated with neurovascular dysfunction.	3.248938057338292
In preoperative X-ray studies, the shortening of the malunited clavicle was between 0.9 and 2.2 cm in comparison to the contralateral clavicle.	3.7630293233680754
All patients underwent an extension osteotomy of the clavicle with interposition of an autogenous iliac crest bone graft.	3.3775328297893625
The follow-up was 1 - 4 years postoperatively.	3.700483527997623
The functional outcome was evaluated using the Constant-Murley and the UCLA score.	3.3736022179558285
All patients had immediate pain relief following osteotomy and correction of the deformity.	3.0548181902563796
The shoulder function rapidly improved, and the functional outcome was good in three out of the four patients.	4.5491272700439245
If there is associated functional impairment in malunited clavicular fractures, extension osteotomy combined with autogenous bone grafting may produce predictably good results.	2.7838998763968297
As the importance of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract continues to grow, the application of this approach in cases of malignancy remains controversial.	4.48715762522951
Although the concept of cancer recurrence in the area of surgical wounds is not new, the incidence of port site recurrence is the most obvious concern.	4.701571486667705
Indications and contraindications for surgery as well as a standardized nomenclature describing the type of laparoscopic procedures being performed are some other issues that need to be clarified.	3.553041713956104
Complete laparoscopic procedures or the combination of laparoscopy with open techniques can offer advantages and disadvantages that surgeons will have to take into consideration when making decisions.	3.4250415632897155
The skill of the operating team and the extent of disease define the boundaries of laparoscopic surgery possible.	3.822841676373256
The continued research as well as development of intelligent instruments and standardized techniques might give laparoscopy a clear role in the treatment of abdominal malignancies.	4.097058775266016
Background: The mechanical stabilization of the cornea in keratoconus may delay progression of this disease.	3.4473711851026945
The cross-linking techniques optimized in corneas of enucleated porcine eyes were investigated under in vivo conditions in rabbits to estimate the biocompatibility and duration of the stiffening effect.	3.3231875056556075
In the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54-year-old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor, spindle-cell neoplasia was seen.	2.886963971092576
No clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible.	3.517868074320218
After resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses, the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma.	4.504586112624651
This was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane antigene (EMA) and of vimentin.	3.464318910537868
Extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with extrapulmonary localization.	3.728100148360937
This case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma.	3.159995713303239
Especially in small biopsy samples showing a submucous spindle-cell tumor of the lung, apart from frequent sarcoma metastases, the presence of primary synovial sarcoma of the lung has to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	3.7337770918619855
Necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.	3.3602622651806855
Formerly, surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard.	4.520993990505205
Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis.	4.541066242442705
A considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation.	4.398475414078769
Nevertheless, surgical treatment is indicated in patients with infected necrosis and in sterile necrosis if multiorgan failure persists over a limited period of time despite maximum intensive care therapy.	3.8569025650505475
Pancreatic resection should be abandoned for surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis, as results with regard to morbidity, mortality and long-term outcome are unsatisfactory.	4.1811945766773135
Today the surgical standard is careful digital necrosectomy, which must be followed by either postoperatve drainage, repeated open lavage or continuous closed lavage.	2.9493439398392787
In experienced hands, all three procedures provide similar results with regard to morbidity and mortality.	3.496020896795025
The aim of quality management in rheumatology is to improve care and outcome in patients with rheumatic diseases.	4.155348672077306
This can be achieved by means of prospective long-term observation of the patient with regular documentation of clinical, radiological, biochemical and functional data using certain validated scoring methods (DAS, radiological score, ADL score Hanover or Health assessment questionnaire, SF36, etc.).	3.4359464553386374
Long-term observation and documentation including radiographs have been performed in the rheumatology hospital in Ratingen for 20 years without even knowing the term quality management.	3.087995026962222
Quality management in a hospital for rheumatic diseases begins with certain structural prerequisites: possibility of direct admission of a patient to the hospital by the family physician, outpatient clinic to investigate and to follow patients over a long period of time, multidisciplinary team with specialists in rheumatology, orthopedic surgery, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, special care, psychological, and social services, close cooperation with specialists in neurology, dermatology, ophthalmology, etc., department of radiology, special laboratory, facilities for internal diagnostics and treatment.	3.2652477611099195
The hospital needs a training program for the qualification of rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons.	2.85747825683742
The hospital staff should closely cooperate with the doctors in private practice who admit patients and should continously support patient organizations.	2.9932318456298868
The quality of outcome is influenced by the process quality which depends on the following factors: selection, training and motivation of the hospital staff; supervision of clinical assessment and documentation by senior physicians, daily x-ray demonstrations and case reports, interdisciplinary case demonstrations at least every week in addition to daily consultation, team reports, regular education including review of actual literature for physicians, education programs exchanging knowledge with physiotherapists and nurses, and regular education programs for patients.	3.269969324744422
Process quality can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary approach and regular communication between all participants including the patient, whose opinion must be noted and regarded.	3.8157768315625726
As far as possible, the same doctor who treats the patient in the hospital should follow her/him in the outpatient clinic.	3.67723878364428
The quality of outcome can be improved by regular reinvestigation of the patient with control of medication, side effects, efficacy, documentation of clinical, biochemical, radiological, and functional data.	3.685647592897305
Decisions for further treatment have to be based on these follow-up data.	5.107514399577676
A standardized follow up and documentation system for all rheumatology units with prompt feedback could definitely improve the quality of rheumatologic care in Germany.	3.1472155325237896
Two children on chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had initially focal, then generalized seizures of short duration.	2.6644258565553165
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed in one case minor parietal, cortical and subcortical increased signal on T2-weighted images.	2.8502086370024347
In a second case extended supratentorial lesions and additional signal changes in the cerebellum were found.	3.2904555127041615
Although chemotherapy was continued, a few days later signal changes were considerably reduced or had disappeared.	3.3830840916871856
We consider these lesions to be seizure induced in a brain previously sensitized by chemotherapy.	2.9890427151766814
Hydatid disease is caused by the parasitic tapeworm Echinococcus.	3.6601600803122585
The larval stage of this parasite can thrive in many parts of the body, most frequently in the liver.	3.3582484288563577
Primary bone location is very rare, accounting for less than 2 % of all hydatid lesions.	3.835619691635472
We report on a case of left-sided extended pelvic infestation.	3.1656372631244536
The destruction of the hip joint, os pubis, large parts of the ileum and the femoral head made pelvic resection and prosthetic replacement necessary.	3.8922085242631175
Recurrence of a hydatid cyst 5 years later in the left groin originating from the proximal femur was treated with second femoral resection and new total hip replacement.	3.661565847509499
Because of instability, the primarily inserted polyacetal pelvic replacement had to be exchanged for a custom-made device fabricated with the aid of computer-aided design (CAD) techniques.	2.9917982598891246
This surgical procedure was combined with chemotherapy (mebendazole).	3.6276548177760906
The necessity of radical resection in osseus hydatid disease is discussed.	3.0517178278976145
At present, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of low cardiac output states.	3.697690562012469
Despite their positive inotropic and lusitropic effects, these drugs are still under discussion because of certain adverse effects like thrombopaenia, elevation of transaminases, abdominal disregulation, and excessive periphereal vasodilatation.	2.906786202530275
As a consequence, more cardioselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors were developed with the aim of reducing these adverse effects.	2.8720851160122423
One of them, enoximone (Marion Merrell Dow, Fig.	2.527004158826343
1), an imidazole derivative, has nearly no influence on platelets and abdominal organ function.	3.5511277742926426
In addition, in many studies vasodilatation was found to be absent.	3.462307405089027
Recently a new substance, R80122 (Janssen, Belgium, Fig.	2.793846022446468
First experimental studies showed high cardioselectivity of this substance.	3.5067654798419996
The aim of this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of enoximone and R80122 in patients with ischaemic heart disease.	2.7976921944711415
The extremely rare finding of a proximal radio-ulnar synostosis in a 5 years-old girl with a fetal alcohol syndrome is presented.	3.3129082854707095
Despite the elbow's being fixed at 30  ° pronation, the patient exhibits good ipsilateral arm function.	3.1582392777864445
The difficulties in differential diagnosis and treatment modalities are discussed.	3.7001997873784642
Ischemic preconditioning (IP), using one or more brief periods of ischemia before a sustained ische- mia, represents a new approach in reducing ischemia-induced skeletal muscle damage.	3.2430802945027764
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IP on skeletal muscle function after 3 h ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in a rodent model.	2.905077294222108
IP protocols using one, two, or three preconditioning cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion each, were compared to non-preconditioned controls.	3.526877266815126
IP was found to significantly improve force, performance, endurance, and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle.	3.5820619008542254
The efficacy of IP- induced protection was correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles.	3.479261581454463
Preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles.	4.7458231346127615
Altogether, this study describes the efficacy of IP in improving post-ischemic muscle function and the need of more than one IP cycle to achieve this improvement.	4.055805828361322
The respective clinical potential warrants further exploration.	3.109765943848381
Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a rare ectodermal dysplasia with variable expression.	3.6242832071207762
The condition is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.	3.4816094979460783
Several classifications of PC have been proposed.	3.772373581213242
Feinstein and colleagues suggested four clinical types of PC.	3.1599838159094182
Type II, the Jackson-Lawler-Syndrome, is characterized by multiple epidermal cysts, palmoplantar bullae and hyperhidrosis as well as natal teeth in addition to the main findings of pachyonychia, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and follicular keratosis.	3.3438306727174663
We report two patients (father and son) with Jackson-Lawler-Syndrome and describe in detail pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches as well as the different classifications of pachyonychia congenita.	3.129123004950282
Aim of this review article was to critically analyse the recently described zytogenetic and molecular markers for testicular germ cell tumors with regard to their clinical utility.	3.4992075829366627
The isochromosome i(12p) represents the most common and characteristic cytogenetic finding which already appears in testicular carcinoma in situ.	3.1724470411824486
A number of proto - oncogenes (Cyclin D and PTHLH) as well as putative tumor suppressor genes are localized on 12p; however, their role in pathogenesis and prognosis of testicular germ cell tumors has not been defined yet.	3.4031101480803048
Clinical characteristics of patients with familial testicular germ cell tumors indicate a genetic background for the development of testicular tumors.	4.455513818413451
Although a number of chromsomal loci encoding potential testicular tumor susceptibility genes have been identified, the genetic basis of testicular cancer pathogenesis is still unknown.	3.234315896999098
With regard to molecular prognostic risk factors most of the reported data on proliferation markers, tumor suppressor genes, proteases and adhesion molecules have to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials prior to their widespread clinical use.	3.565483564356868
Based on the available data on prospective studies percentage of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion appear to be the most significant prognosticators.	3.4740681278077825
After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, carbon dioxide (CO2) must be exhaled after resorption from the abdominal cavity.	3.104457783311786
There is controversy about the amount and relevance of postoperative CO2 resorption.	3.221410275959915
Without continuous postoperative monitoring, after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a certain risk may consist in unnoticed hypercapnia due to CO2 resorption.	3.0321321509296677
Studies exist on the course of end-expiratory CO2 (PeCO2) alone over a longer postoperative period of time in extubated patients during spontaneous breathing.	3.7004310326716827
The goal of this prospective study was to investigate the amount of CO2 resorbed from the abdominal cavity in the postoperative period by means of CO2 metabolism.	3.720197991565762
After giving informed consent to the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee, 20 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	4.418067795111059
All patients received general endotracheal anaesthesia.	2.8785931727209593
After induction, total IV anaesthesia was maintained using fentanyl, propofol, and atracurium.	3.0657672272100105
Patients were ventilated with oxygen in air (FiO2 0.4).	3.0897222207309776
The intraabdominal pressure during the surgical procedure ranged from 12 to 14 mm Hg.	3.5461034323971092
Thirty minutes after releasing the capnoperitoneum (KP), CO2 elimination (V.CO2), oxygen uptake (V.O2), and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured every minute for 1 h by indirect calorimetry using the metabolic monitor Deltatrac according to the principle of Canopy.	3.402310655370191
Assuming an unchanged metabolism, the CO2 resorption (V.CO2) at any given time (t) can be calculated from V.CO2 (t)=V.CO2 (t)-RQ (preop) V.O2 (t).	3.478823037122652
It was thus necessary to define the patient's metabolism on the day of operation.	3.5633436795327658
The first data were collected before surgery and after introduction of the arterial and venous cannulae for a 15-min period.	3.7662005169190684
Measuring point 0 was determined after exsufflation of the KP and emptying of the remaining CO2 via manual compression by the surgeon at the end of surgery.	3.4550451890794704
Patient's tracheas were extubated and metabolic monitoring started 30 min after release of the KP for 60 min.	3.336932761117842
Simultaneously, a nasal side-stream capnometry probe was placed and the PeCO2 and respiratory frequency (RF) were obtained by the Capnomac Ultima (Datex) and registered every minute as well.	3.0412034660739895
Values were averaged over four periods of 15 min each.	3.2577106012315364
An arterial blood gas sample was drawn at the end of every 15-min period.	3.56859061157901
Postoperative pain was scored by a visual analog scale and completed by a subjective index questionnaire on general well-being.	3.2514031442558387
All data were analysed by the Friedman or Wilcoxon test; P<0.05 was considered significant.	2.853009482496733
The findings do not indicate CO2 resorption in the postoperative period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Tables 2 and 3, Fig.	3.4369751421491834
The postoperative RF was comparable to preoperative values.	3.389323510863093
Calculated CO2 was lower than 10 ml/min and within accuracy of measurements.	4.5078008812892385
The postoperative pain index ranged between 3 and 4, and 3.75 - 15 mg piritramid was administered.	3.0756838522241265
All patients feld tired immediately after the operation, but scores improved slightly at the end of the 60-min period of metabolic monitoring.	3.5443179786876686
There is no significant resorption of CO2 from the abdominal cavity later than 30 min after releasing the KP.	3.2849757301691294
Up to this time, any CO2 remaining in the abdominal cavity after careful emptying by the surgeon has been resorbed and exhaled.	3.2270982729463906
The gene of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-inhibitor p16INK4A (CDKN2/MTS1) has been proposed as a candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21, a frequently deleted region in a series of human cancers including malignant melanoma.	3.0272147730042303
An increasing and sometimes conflicting body of data has accumulated regarding the frequency of homozygous deletions and mutations as well as the importance of p16INK4A in malignant melanoma.	3.71091232852726
The purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on p16INK4A and to discuss its biologic significance in the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumors.	3.33651891217051
The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in HIV-infected patients is high.	3.292157263195625
Clinical aspects and psychopathological findings are not sufficient for differential diagnosis and identification of primarily psychiatric disorders.	3.865986741635982
Secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging (CT, MRI) and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid.	3.904924838638142
In emergency situations, however, German law imposes strict regulations, especially in the case of sectioned patients.	3.9238336624667305
These medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and propositions for an effective strategy are made.	3.139115739605993
In simultaneous bilateral nerve recordings, patients with Sympathetically Maintained Pain (SMP) affecting one limb show similar sympathetic traffic in nerves supplying the affected and unaffected limb, also when the painful limb shows a marked regional autonomic (vasomotor) dysfunction.	2.8827175066416193
These findings argue against the notion that SMP must be mediated by a reflex change in the pattern of sympathetic discharge.	3.1235929929851234
In general, they underline the fact that autonomic effector disturbances may give little information about underlying nerve traffic.	3.0353384005226514
Intraoperative transluminal angioplasty (ITA) has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction, fulfils the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years.	3.3344700126330746
Whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature, reports on the procedural management of ITA are rare.	4.2266305865373175
One of the basic prerequisites of this method is the correct and nontraumatic implantation of the vascular access sheath at the proper location.	3.8119418619933647
In the following, the technique of ortho- and retrograde sheath implantation, either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft, is described in detail.	3.236614655720498
By respecting particular standards for sheath introduction, ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ITA can be kept to a minimum.	2.869255846456132
The importance of the chronology of vascular reconstruction to angioplasty is also elucidated.	3.1687996273975068
In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated.	2.8982222965970896
In spite of new developments, including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon, the "ideal" angioplasty access sheath is, as yet, not available.	3.2994771912199146
In several cases of lupus erythematosus (SLE, SCLE, DLE), the Koebner phenomenon could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas, scratching effects, operation scars, contact dermatitis, pressure from sock tops, application of liquid nitrogen, exposure to strong sun light, etc.	3.1842285390998564
The interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case.	2.9690788092489835
In SLE patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, the Koebner phenomenon could not be found, while it was detected in patients with generalized DLE who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones.	4.037740957272911
It was not seen in patients with localized DLE.	4.142555305534695
There was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the Koebner phenomenon.	3.646667996660355
With regard to the histopathogenesis of the Koebner phenomenon, it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network, with expression of adhesion molecules, might be involved.	3.798121044356551
The Koebner phenomenon may be a valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus.	3.9851157629865916
In 5 years 9 patients with a total of 16 painful ear nodules (chondrodermatitis helicis) have been treated as follows.	3.954870630048807
A small excision is carried out with local anaesthesia for histological examination.	3.683738374741377
The rest of the nodule or any other nodules are carbonized by means of the argon laser, also with local anaesthesia, including the surface of the cartilage under the nodules.	3.6548407310532713
There have been no cases of postoperative inflammation or infection.	2.758447013481987
New nodules occurring several months after treatment have been successfully treated in the same way.	4.371728414753987
There have been no real recurrences.	2.6872428150767282
The cosmetic result is very good in all cases.	3.3540840895946973
The patients are free of pain immediately after the laser therapy.	3.822082946649561
Laser therapy for painful nodules of the ear has good and lasting results, with a lower rate of recurrences than any other form of treatment.	3.8550762944486427
We represent and discuss etiology, diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous orchtitis referring to an actual case of this rare disease.	3.7164620263405306
In the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease.	3.863238097989031
Other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease.	3.230468528972134
Quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection veils the sterile leucocyturia as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis.	3.1523633121428905
Imaging diagnostics frequently fails to give indications of tuberculous origin of the lesion.	3.4379005427252807
In such dubious cases we recommend to perform an operative denudation due to frequently difficult delimitation from malignant testicular tumours.	2.8977606537860328
In surgical procedures associated with high blood loss, such as vascular and cardiac operations, differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance.	4.302214946698312
Preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders [drug-induced platelet disorders (in particular ASS), von Willebrand's disease and other congenital platelet disorders] is effective in minimizing blood loss.	3.778640301587456
Bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance.	3.1249631991468347
Therefore, simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems.	3.431950956444788
The aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding.	3.29247528348488
Although deep vein thrombosis now has a better prognosis than in the era before anticoagulation, a number of patients remain in whom ulcus cruris cannot be adequately controlled by conservative treatment.	3.923725062940947
The case report of a 50-year-old woman with stage III chronic venous insufficiency associated with the post-thrombotic syndrome is presented.	3.4688477344050392
Progress in imaging techniques and functional diagnostics of the post-thrombotic syndrome make a reliable differentiation of the chronic venous insufficiency possible with respect to obstruction or reflux.	3.803803476212036
If conservative treatment fails, autological valve transplantation is described as a suitable reconstructive management method in the treatment of reflux.	3.573629858355558
Following this report, the results and limitations of this method are discussed.	4.961556205551485
The neurobiological alterations commonly found in affective disorders (e.g., alterations in the nocturnal sleep profile, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system) gradually recover with improvement of the depressive syndrome.	3.0394673036728084
Their persistence during full clinical remission, however, is associated with an increased risk for relapse and, thus may represent trait markers for affective disorders.	3.6430676703584144
In order to test this hypothesis, we designed a prospective study in which healthy first-degree relatives (high-risk probands; HRPs; n=54) of patients with an affective disorder are investigated by means of polysomnography, the combined dexamethasone and corticotropine-releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test and a variety of psychometric scales.	3.5273227879292963
In the present part of the study (index assessment), these HRPs, as a group, showed depressionlike alterations in both the sleep pattern and the DEX-CRH-test outcome; furthermore, their psychometric profile was characterized by elevated scores on the scales assessing "rigidity" and "autonomic lability".	3.3804225503227734
On a single-case level, 35% of the HRPs were identified as conspicuous (depressionlike) in at least two of the three areas investigated.	3.7634358854074423
Undifferentiated connective tissue disease with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in a 33 year old woman after recurrent arterial thromboses, two miscarriages and myocarditis.	3.298781458662966
Despite effective immunosuppression and anticoagulation her initially mild precapillary pulmonary hypertension progressed in the absence of thromboembolic events, cardiopulmonary disease or other systemic disorders.	3.2404876965035068
iloprost in a dosage of up to 4.5 ng/kg/min for a total of 15 months, her 6 min walking-distance improved from 210 to 315 m, the pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 1710 to 1111 dynxsxcm-5 and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 64 to 54 mmHg.	3.4407749322581602
This partial success of conservative treatment enabled a reassessment of the necessity for heart and lung transplantation.	3.360971214793027
In the USA, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been approved for therapy of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within a 3 hour time window based on the results of the NINDS [1] trial.	3.6703516627616417
Only few patients with AIS are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms, and only 3% of these patients qualify for treatment with rt-PA.	3.976030733620996
Therefore, only few patients with AIS will potentially benefit from therapy with rt-PA if NINDS criteria are applied.	3.3338406332220587
The goal of the Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in AIS for a 6 hour time window.	3.03151968471653
Objective: To prove the response and side effects of sulphasalazine in early and late onset juvenile pauciarthritis, also the therapeutic effect dependent on the marker HLA B27.	3.546957819667316
The radiologic imaging methods play an important role in the precise staging as basic requirement for an effective concept of tumor therapy.	3.2291101298768616
The accuracy of ultrasound in the primary staging according to the TNM-classification (UICC) was therefore prospectively investigated in 260 patients with head and neck tumors of the clinical stages T1N0 to T4N3.	4.02184343812986
The clinically (C1) and sonographically (C2) evaluated pretherapeutic stages were compared to the postoperative histopathologic tumor classifications.	3.389872038787646
The clinical staging was correct in 75.0 %, high in 7.7 %, low in 17.3 %, the N-stages were correct in 59.2 %, high in 17.7 %, low in 23.1 %.	2.83359147248729
The sonographic staging was apparently superior with the T-classifications correct in 92.3 %, high in 7.7 %, low 0.0 %.	2.869374765240799
The N-stages were correct in 89.6 %, high in 9.2 %, low in 1.2 %.	3.1151767306601594
Accompanying inflammations, foregoing biopsies and tooth extractions were the main reasons for incorrect staging.	3.343411073159997
Therefore, the thorough sonographic investigation performed after the clinical examination and before invasive procedures, due to little patient discomfort, good availability and high accuracy, is an excellent sectional imaging method for staging, therapy-planning and follow up of tumors of the head and neck especially of the orofacial regions.	3.769914078181192
Standardized guidelines for exercise training for patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) have not been established.	4.193967224919148
In the past CHF patients involved in exercise training studies demonstrated a wide range of cardiac and functional impairment, with an ejection fraction between 18 and 35% and a peak VO2 between 12.2 and 25.4 ml/kg/min on average.	3.3161036652155595
For determination of training intensity, a VO2 between 40 and 70% of peak VO2 and/or training heart rate between 60 and 80% of peak heart rate was used.	3.564537844078463
There was also a wide range for frequency (between 3 and 7 times per week) and duration of training (between 20 and 60 min per session).	3.454039320426855
For aerobic exercise training only continuous training methods were applied.	3.173293683577375
We have developed a new interval training method which allows intense exercise stimuli on peripheral muscles with minimal cardiac strain.	3.0031010504863085
After only three weeks of training, the improvement in aerobic capacity was similar to that reported after longer training periods using continuous methods.	3.2966460162502904
To determine work rate for work phases of interval training, a special steep ramp test was developed.	2.98501896460515
By analysis of acute physical responses to this testing procedure and to the interval training, both were proven to be tolerable in CHF patients, even if their ejection fraction is as low as 13%, or peak cardiac index not greater than 1.6 l/m2/min, and peak VO2 less than 8.5 ml/kg/min.	3.5248813158264256
Therapeutic choice in laryngeal carcinoma is influenced by the nature of the tumor and a variety of factors involving the patient and physician.	4.052835272227618
Small (T1) and exophytic (T1, T2) tumors are suitable for radiotherapy.	3.1132429433670734
Extensive tumors (large T2; T3) are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation, especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy.	3.787355334097243
When radiation treatment fails, surgery succeeds in more than half of the cases.	3.254307790627883
Tumors infiltrating or transgressing the laryngeal framework (T4) can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy.	3.155133464762649
Subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts.	3.1103649277759953
Lymphatics are preferentially treated with the same modality as used in the primary disease.	4.912657538473706
Inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases, with the exception of early glottic cancer.	4.375989840867487
Induced hypotension is defined as a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 50-60 mm Hg in normotensive subjects.	4.17462042666773
The aim of induced hypotension is to decrease intraoperative blood loss, decrease the need for blood transfusions and improve operating conditions.	3.5810151346471253
Most studies indicate that induced hypotension can decrease intraoperative blood loss by 50% in many surgical procedures; however, some studies report that blood loss is not significantly reduced.	3.2123005862906346
Current methods of induced hypotension are based on the use of rapid and short-acting vasodilators as primary agents (nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, urapidil), supplemented by volatile anesthetics (isoflurane) and/or -blockers (esmolol) to improve effect, reduce dosage and prevent side effects (reflex tachycardia, tachyphylaxis, rebound hypertension).	3.4445901133540646
Major risks of induced hypotension are a reduction in blood flow (i.e.	3.955486394378701
ischaemia) of vital organs (brain, myocardium) and elevation of intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients.	3.5230946147210433
Thus, major contraindications of induced hypotension are severe coronary artery disease, hypertension combined with arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels and increased intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral disease.	3.631446984281576
Complications are rare in otherwise healthy patients, but may be higher in elderly patients and those with underlying organ dysfunction.	4.263774655629474
Therefore, careful assessment and selection of patients, together with consideration of the potential complications, appropriate choice of drugs and invasive beatby-beat monitoring, are essential for the safe practice of induced hypotension.	3.9674280877071353
Abstract  Empirical results stemming from infant research have contributed extensively to the understanding of coping with psychosocial stress and vulnerability for psychosomatic symptoms in later life.	2.968377374728589
The interaction and the emotional exchange between caregiver and child in the first months of life lead to representations of interactions that will be the base for the quality of attachment.	3.63835191125646
The mutual regulation of the caregiver-infant-pair enables the child to acquire a psychic capacity to regulate physiological requirements.	3.087335676446252
This selfregulatory function determines the potential of the later adult to react to distress - in a symbolic way using words or more in a somatic way by developing psychosomatic symptoms.	3.1426485831192266
First experiences with the treatment of psychosomatic patients with respect to the new findings about self-regulation are reported.	4.172253679025032
A 31-year-old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction.	3.5681213119297244
The patient's preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before.	3.6809562892691403
The physical examination - including sonography of the two fetuses - showed no pathological signs.	3.5698753525346083
Anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side, using routine precautions pre-oxygenation, and rapid sequence intubation, and was maintained unproblematically.	3.379870161497946
About 20 min after the onset of surgery, hypotension, tachycardia, and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared.	4.484052430464206
Elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left tilzing of the operating table did not lead to improvement.	3.3880776422535743
The development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction.	3.7053677717283175
The patient was treated successfully with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids (prednisolone).	2.691433546113358
The suspicion of latex-related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio-allergen-sorbent test (RAST) and prick and scratch tests.	2.744910756510468
The mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation.	3.9691169451887633
The heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy.	2.8650959579200586
During late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position.	3.6264376274017867
A fall in heart rate was only seen in this period.	3.7167349668033376
A fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy.	3.2569361152960083
The hypotensive symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy.	3.053540105266516
Headaches, fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints.	3.845568339257262
The frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation.	3.1782750657093883
Blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women.	3.202212801210602
However, the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position.	3.5269827407411425
The Birth-weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position, but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing.	3.430033607908503
Pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight.	3.3043992509445133
The combination of saltwater baths and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation is an effective treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.	2.9912128552040373
The aim of the present study was to determine the photosensitizing properties of two commercially available bath salts, original salt from the Dead Sea and sodium chloride.	2.491716089255492
To address this issue, test areas on the volar aspects of the forearms were soaked with salt solutions for 15 minutes prior to ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation.	3.005954241156423
The salt concentrations tested were 1%, 3% 5% and 15%.	3.5200769519884294
Tap water followed by UVB and UVB alone served as controls.	2.8145345266030737
Erythema was determined by visual and photometric measurement, and delayed tanning was assessed by colorimetry.	3.59677830126139
Erythema obtained by wetting the skin prior to UVB irradiation was more pronounced than erythema induced by UVB alone.	3.122711566851251
The most prominent erythema was yielded by tap water+UVB.	2.784906008583265
There was only a moderate influence on delayed tanning by bathing the skin prior to irradiation.	2.92517332814451
The results from the present study indicate that soaking the skin with salt solutions or tap water increases skin sensitivity to subsequent UVB irradiation.	3.466823463739985
This may contribute to the effectiveness of salt water baths followed by UV irradiation and may account for an increased sunburn risk after bathing.	3.48592405390397
Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis, e. g. early elective resection and primary anastomosis.	3.369613841562428
Methods: The data of 445 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified Hinchey classification (stages 0-III).	3.1805889693602873
Results: Within our study group the morbidity was 26.5 % (n = 118) and the mortality was 1.6 % (n = 7).	3.7693178780901064
In 96 % (n = 425) of all cases and in 64 % (21/33) of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis (stage III), a primary anastomosis was performed.	4.533425128510747
Four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis (0.9 %).	4.078479389027903
No leakage was observed from any of the anastomoses performed in stage III diverticulitis.	3.6652448734261074
Stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality.	3.3843888715113764
Some 53 % (94/177) of the patients in stage II and 67 % (22/33) of the patients in stage III had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before.	3.9413049252301655
Conclusion: Prophylactic surgery to avoid life-threatening situations, including abscess formation or perforation, is not possible in many cases.	3.9125417805136813
However, especially patients at risk (age, coexisting illness) should undergo early surgery.	3.3535705412692285
Primary anastomosis can be performed safely even at an advanced stage.	3.5934834158049704
To evaluate whether MRI is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined.	2.789762067482464
Tumor staging by CT and MR imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium.	3.5552417973431836
In MRI 4 out of 7 thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy, in CT none.	3.208353964775148
In advanced renal carcinoma MRI with Gadolinium was superior to CT imaging, especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus.	3.5411775040217908
Consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by MRI which therefore may replace conventional cavography.	3.556494616259663
Children of mothers chronically infected with hepatitis-C-virus (HCV) during pregnancy and delivery were prospectively followed.	3.452365371637062
90 children born to 85 infected mothers were included in our study; nine of the mothers were known to be co-infected with HIV-1.	4.047249746370672
These 90 children were first tested within 60 days after birth and followed for at least three months.	3.559692839702098
Three of the 90 children became infected perinatally with HCV as shown by persistence of antibodies after 2 years of life and a positive result in the RT-PCR.	3.5731199134620106
One of these 3 children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase values, but is otherwise clinically well, likewise the other 2 infected children.	2.9308199236618386
54 of the 87 uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year.	3.3590761191920087
Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital malformation in which a membrane divides the right atrium into two chambers.	4.069482012445237
The membrane represents a persistence of the right sinus venosus valve (RSV).	3.449713809853378
Normally the RSV regresses between the 9th and 15th week of gestation, as the cephalic portion forms the crista terminalis and the caudal portion develops into the Eustachian and Thebesian valve.	2.8743568248838463
Any failure in the regression process may result in remnants of RSV as a simple muscle bar, a Chiari-network or a fenestrated or unfenestrated membrane (cor triatriatum dexter).	2.884692289749714
We describe a patient with cor triatriatum dexter in whom diagnosis was made several years after successful valvulotomy procedure for severe congenital valvular pulmonary stenosis.	2.913085230122487
Apoptosis and proliferation are important regulators of normal development and homeostasis in the bone marrow.	3.6546589510148637
Therefore, dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters.	3.094347495408603
However, since only few data are available from previous studies, we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism.	4.110825602540866
A total of 400 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study.	2.9655542613280965
Apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the ISEL-technique and topoisomerase II  expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody Ki-S1.	3.275681422870768
Furthermore, by determination of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen labeling (PCNA) index, we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase, because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle.	3.316661041917845
Patients with IMF, PV, and ET revealed a normal range of apoptosis, whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) a significant increase could be observed.	3.3745417853041193
On the other hand, IMF and PV were characterized by a raised proliferative activity.	2.727075234074016
Dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index.	3.708010485292514
In CML and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable, but IMF and PV showed a significant increase.	3.6474195926329265
Survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation.	3.85443508655082
In conclusion, our in-situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics.	3.0420935595722542
In this context, a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and/or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome.	3.7226688550672233
In a complex animal model in sheep, polydioxanone (PDS) and polylactic membranes were used for the reconstruction of large orbital-wall defects.	3.0867290375269327
In a long-term experiment over 1 year, polylactic implants alone showed the best performance as compared with combinations involving autogenous bone grafts and titanium miniplate fixation.	3.294553793934668
As soon as these polylactic implants are approved for human surgery, they will be used to solve the still challenging problem of anatomical reconstruction of large comminuted fractures of more than one orbital wall.	3.4689239764190862
Surgery by three-dimensional (3D) endoscopy is being used routinely in abdominal surgery and, in special cases, in thoracic surgery; however, it has not been reported as being used in microlaryngeal surgery.	3.728256271499345
We inserted a 3-D endoscope into a jet laryngoscope and studied the pressure properties at the tip of the laryngoscope as well as intrapulmonary pressures while applying superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation.	3.4741442595746066
The studies were conducted initially using a lung simulator, and then in seven patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery.	3.3021969913801623
Due to the rather large 3-D endoscope, the diameter of the jet laryngoscope was reduced by between 25.2% and 70.9%, depending on its size.	3.3213294437842356
The measurements on the lung simulator revealed that reduction of laryngoscope diameter leads to an increase in the following parameters: expiratory resistance, tidal volume, and peak inspiratory pressure.	3.555462184311031
The mean FiO2 was 0.74 +/- 0.1; the mean paO2 was 169.2 +/- 80.4 mm Hg; and the mean paCO2 was 40.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg.	3.083067096001132
The mean airway pressure was 19 +/- 5.3 mm Hg prior to insertion of the endoscope and 12.3 +/- 6.9 mm Hg after insertion.	3.062685948774879
The mean positive end-expiratory pressure values increased from 2 +/- 0.6 to 3.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg.	3.163320371770385
Reduction of the working pressure resulted in restoration of the initial inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes.	3.226936585294575
In the clinical application of 3-D endoscopy via a jet laryngoscope, it was possible to achieve sufficient ventilation, inspection of the surgical field, and performance of the surgical procedure.	4.075860306615255
A CO2 laser was used without changing the ventilation regime.	3.249941068330265
Although technical alterations would be desirable for its application to microlaryngeal surgery, it is presently possible to safely use the 3-D endoscope via the jet laryngoscope for microlaryngeal surgery, presenting the surgeon with new possibilities in voice-improving microsurgery of the larynx.	3.403997659108041
Kryopreserved specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips.	3.692680147944028
The cystic duct was fixed, and the transverse placed clips were distracted in axial direction and the forces registered.	3.4798076255169406
In detail, both resorbable clips (polydioxanone, polyglyconate/polyglycol acetate) were superior to the four titanium clips (P < 0.005, Wilcoxon test).	2.980100836670776
In addition to the advantage of complete biodegradibility, these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips.	3.4112553518418864
The efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to O2 transport and especially the effective O2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations, such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.	3.966108934798471
The hemoglobin molecule could be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.	3.297523778691588
This results in a clinically utilizable intravascular half-life of about 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity, and a lack of nephrotoxicity.	4.011559088606763
A degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here.	3.3439202547044937
In spite of this, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.	3.144570277457833
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are, therefore, well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.	3.4579480242896223
The capacity for the release of O2 to the tissues is especially excellent.	3.514394847733594
This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation.	3.089247928119329
Perflubron, the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in man and is well tolerated.	4.226704416826803
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients.	3.0626550971799786
Launch is expected within the next few years.	3.2253041461462826
The new volatile anaesthetic desflurane is characterized by very low blood-gas and tissue-blood partition coefficients, so that rapid induction of anaesthesia and shorter recovery times can be expected.	3.5530896834024968
The aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of desflurane and isoflurane on haemodynamics and recovery time when used as part of a balanced anaesthesia technique for elective surgery.	3.1011949249075696
In acute coronary syndromes, arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density.	3.3090613142197234
The underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear.	2.9095755616907075
Among others, increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.	3.1569675151155847
The objectives of the present study were to evaluate plaque group differences in the cellular composition, to detect and quantify cell death, and to diferentiate between apoptosis and necrosis.	3.9710806278157205
On occasion of the 100th anniversary of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in Russia in the years from 1926 to 1937.	3.315537090792039
These operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation.	3.726132110722459
This work pioneered by Russian scientist S. Brukhonenko and the Surgeon N. Terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public.	2.7555421740411905
The first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than 260 operations on the valves of the open heart, the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism, and principles of open heart surgery stated by N. Terebinski were decades ahead of the development at the time.	3.6128068668610056
In the authors' opinion they represent a milestone in the history of open heart surgery.	3.0640818556002714
Aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare.	4.096131582269906
The literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations.	3.0234970037757978
In the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right-sided intrapetrous aneurym after myringotomy, which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media.	3.2817829816005806
Due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible.	4.040271354440229
Subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms.	3.861723610616191
Leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle, fascia lata and a gelatin-resorcin-formalin-glue (Cardial).	2.7617599834300544
In order to apply the tissue patch the hypotympanic site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior otosurgical approach.	2.9393860540067824
Due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries.	2.8511450905641142
Temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm.	3.5018432453504573
Following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy.	3.361625770882162
Blindness causes human suffering and high social costs.	3.4013542485682584
Virtually all blind people are registered with the social services.	3.562758565362275
Data from these institutions may help in (long-term) planning for blindness prevention.	3.603680646176057
The stage-oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice.	3.1413241081726437
Nowadays, partial stem varicosis, which is an earlier stage of the disease, leads to operative treatment more frequently than 10 years ago; thus a sufficient vein stump remains after surgical treatment.	3.806641367176077
After surgery on a group of 1000 patients, we examined the stumps for patency, the occurrence of varicose changes, for their availability in the long term, and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery.	3.765630189435501
The treatment of insufficient perforant veins was also included in the surgical therapy, as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins.	3.775830667185601
With a follow-up period of up to 33 months postoperatively, the results show a high patency rate in the remaining stumps (97%), as well as a high sufficiency rate (94%), with a mean graft length of 29.4 cm.	4.234390117850554
Thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions.	3.1492107965876963
Background: Corneal HLA-DR antigens are going to be lost during organ culture storage.	3.0475564187877486
The authors present a rare case of solitary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the skull of an 11-year-old girl.	3.510795088724782
The clinical, radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report.	3.8989228006608334
The morphological features of intra- and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging.	3.620543935803279
Although rare, NHL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children.	3.0260075244353972
Neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age.	3.4391048668109714
Despite progress in the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, definite diagnosis for most of these disorders is still possible only by neuropathological examination of the brain.	4.14930815065312
The neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years, particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies, resulting in the development of new disease-specific antibodies.	4.586353984871337
Internationally recognized consensus criteria for most neurodegenerative disorders allow a definite and standardized diagnosis to be made.	2.9800469316359584
To obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis, particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies, studies with clinically and neuropathologically well-documented cases are needed.	4.146199715353437
The project "Brain-Net" has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a German Brain and Tissue Bank for Diseases of the Central Nervous System.	3.0847109787737717
The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.	2.9409990366473417
Fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the unborn child's life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally.	3.2962977868134575
Such surgery is a clinical reality now.	4.0174609813561295
Indications for intrataurine surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities, especially in the upper respiratory tract.	3.805696061783407
These include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias, prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary overdistension, and resection of embryonic tumors that obstruct the respiratory tract.	3.357065647537263
The relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques.	3.0093390498499404
Endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance.	3.3515583147695556
In part of the procedures, only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use.	3.8219914844156797
Further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions, even in cases with non-lethal conditions.	4.556962433534622
More diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications.	4.316561334616029
One example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate, which until now has only been performed in animal experiments.	3.123948101435836
The particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy.	3.307281853633034
This offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is invisible externally and avoids growth-impeding scars.	3.076955853322804
The particular ethical and legal aspects of fetal surgery are discussed.	3.1453332115052963
We report on a 57-year-old patient suffering from a complex malposition of proximal femur after osteosynthesis using a condylar plate.	2.94572261416259
For polyaxial correction of the proximal femur we successfully used an intramedullary hip screw system.	3.7621974974277714
In 6 patients with primary malignant bone tumors (4 Ewing, 1 recurrent Adamantinoma, 1 maligne Haemangioperizytoma) the local therapy was performed as intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation.	3.070968308002693
One recurrence occurred in the host bed; in two cases the replanted segment had to be removed because of severe infection.	4.380278835665999
The other cases showed good functional and radiological results.	3.7366818800021773
These clinical findings and the reports in the literature seem to allow the application of the intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation procedure for defect reconstruction in cases of chemo- and radiotherapy-sensitive bone tumors.	3.651719871782812
Numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.	3.316353843193731
In patients undergoing vascular surgery, epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative hypercoagulability.	3.1330228357188163
These patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re-operation.	3.9038982077669124
However, regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies.	2.986677044708023
One reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care.	3.132406128562332
A multimodal therapeutic approach, which consists of preoperativ patient information, sufficient analgesia, early mobilisation and enteral feeding, may solve this discrepancy.	3.191337413367498
Therefore, prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome.	4.242342761423583
Although cerebrovascular diseases are the most common causes of dementia after Alzheimer's desease, vascular dementia (VD) has remained so far an ill-defined term.	3.262479311684957
The main problems in the definition of VD arise from finding criteria for both terms "vascular" and "dementia".	3.4102754843324314
The detailed criteria for the diagnosis of VD proposed by several groups or institutions (ADDTC, DSM-IV, ICD-10, NINDS-ARIEN) are critically reviewed.	3.435101950498604
The diagnostic value of some clinical findings, especially the very frequent white matter luciencies in CT (leuko-araiosis), are discussed.	3.320929783610619
The available studies suggest a differentiation of VD into some subtypes (listed according to frequency): subcortical VD, VD with acute onset, multiinfarct-dementia, mixed types, and specific forms.	2.8195593837439037
Nevertheless, these subtypes give only little information about the etiology of the underlying vascular process and, therefore, no clear indication for specific therapeutic strategies.	3.763800174358875
The aetiology of varicosis is still unclear.	3.108587395930891
Investigation of changes in normal veins which result in the formation of varicosis led to examination of elastic properties and histomorphological alterations in the region of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall of the long saphenous vein in normal and varicose veins.	3.797911566885125
The rigidity of varicose veins was higher than that of normal veins; there was no difference between the varicose vein above a competent valve and the "normal" vein below this competent valve.	3.379105353618418
The matrix proteins demonstrated an increase in total fibres, whereas the elastic fibres were reduced and fragmented, explained the rigidity of varices.	3.756999636840422
These results suggest that the role of the venous valves in the development of varicose veins is secondary to changes of the vein wall.	4.323224051661863
An investigation of 122 knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the meniscofemoral ligaments (MFL) Humphry and Wrisberg.	3.298264666903044
Of the knees examined, 96% showed one or more ligaments, the incidence was independent of gender or age.	3.692948699814067
The osseous parameters of the dorsal and ventral notch as well as the diacondylar width did not correlate with the incidence of MFL.	4.105974853668157
A dorsal notch width index (dNWI), which has not been described so far, was 0.26 in females and 0.28 in males.	3.485824171155217
The ligamentum meniscofemorale posterius (Wrisberg) showed distinct morphological variations.	2.9318090683712317
This resulted in a classification of type I-III.	4.72125128556949
The results of the study underline the importance of the MFL for knee joint function including stabilization, proprioception, and meniscal positioning.	3.1867909524446345
Eleven patients with high-grade mucosal dysplasia in a columnar-lined oesophagus and 2 patients with a squamous carcinoma (uT1) underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT) and argon-plasma coagulation (APC).	3.4073328412991493
For PDT, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was given orally (60 mg/kg) and treated endoscopically with a light dose of 150 J/cm2 (100 mW/cm2) at 635 nm 4-6 h later.	3.5824755544455225
A second PDT was performed under the same conditions 2-3 weeks later.	3.6125414085794216
Patients who received APC were treated 4 times on average to reach radical Barrett mucosa eradication.	2.9377236420388524
All patients were consistently given medication to suppress acid production.	2.7918471172865127
No complications occurred in either group.	2.4884711258696246
Follow-up endoscopies and multiple biopsies for 3-42 months showed squamous regeneration in the dysplastic columnar-lined oesophagus in all 11 patients.	2.7687390566972825
Two patients with squamous carcinoma were found to have a recurrence 9 and 12 months later.	3.943062582761925
PDT with 5-ALA-induced endogenous porphyrins, as well as APC combined with omeprazole protection, can eradicate superficial high-grade dysplastic mucosa in Barrett's oesophagus.	3.5563752265134445
However, we did not succeed in destroying a manifest carcinoma.	2.6827119934731543
Technical advantages of spiral technology are of great usefulness in diagnostic imaging of thorax and abdomen in children.	3.2738784623587356
The rapid imaging time allows the examination of an entire organ while scanning with breath holding or while the child is quietly breathing, resulting in a decreased need for sedation.	3.087465767272777
In addition especially examinations of the chest an to some extend CT-investigations of the abdomen are performed with reduced radiation dose achieved by reducing the tube loading.	3.5409770466831296
Radiation dose reduction of 70% is possible without loss of relevant diagnostic information.	3.4064310330842975
Spiral low-dose CT in pediatric chest imaging is useful in evaluating parenchymal lung diseases, mediastinal masses and central airway malformations.	3.3117015222344643
Whether abdominal helical CT can be replaced by MRI has to be decided in each individual case.	3.5303369835969605
When an exact protocol is used, sufficient contrast material given, scan-delay optimized and postprocessing reconstructions are performed, usefull additional diagnostic informations are obtained by the method.	3.2265116644484277
Invasive monitoring is a standard procedure in modern intensive care medicine.	3.9684410461351205
Despite significant progress in the routine use and catheter technology, there are relevant remaining risks concerning acute central venous and arterial access and chronic persistence of catheters within the vascular lumen.	3.499061926744178
Resulting from the infectiologically established novel definition of antiseptic which contains the local application of antiseptics for prophylactical, preventive or therapeutical indication on skin, mucous membrane, wounds, in body cavities or on surgical exposed resp.	2.7126497077723783
opened endosomatic areas the antiseptical indications in a branch of dermatology and venereal diseases are represented.	2.996785506345646
With the analysis of the actual knowledge in vitro and in vivo requirements to local antiinfectiva are defined combined with the recommendations for the clinical use.	4.000812458414126
At present mainly prophylactically used agents are submitted to a benefit risk analysis with refer to the choice of agents.	3.0859191199390508
Thereby agents for the application on skin as well as on genitals, in mouth cavity and on wounds were taken into consideration.	3.6260592701145526
Hydatid disease, still frequent in endemic areas, is usually localized in the liver.	3.382481277493743
Despite the benign nature of the disease it is one of the problematic fields of surgery due to the high complication rate and long hospital stay.	4.268877601115805
Based on our experience we recommend evacuation of the cyst and omentoplasty as the surgical method of choice, as it is associated with a relatively low incidence of complications and can be performed easily.	4.354272755325086
Background: Central catheters in neonatological intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of medicataion or parenteral infusions.	3.4521406085437767
Dislocations and septic and thromboembolic complications may occur.	3.3609181833809414
Low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in particle size, density, and physical as well as chemical properties.	3.6038848013468856
Regarding size and density, LDL can be divided into two main profiles, LDL pattern A with elevated concentration of large, buoyant LDL particles and LDL pattern B with increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles.	2.8041069092427633
The latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of HDL and particularly HDL2 cholesterol.	3.0717043023588593
The LDL profile of increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.	2.922134098344047
The LDL profile is partly genetically determined, but can be improved by non-pharmacological (exercise, diet) and pharmacological intervention.	3.4777259571724843
It remains to be confirmed whether the LDL subfraction profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides HDL2 cholesterol and triglycerides, but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk.	3.1088116606035925
Traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia.	3.1754297563019898
In the hand, which is perfused by two arteries, this symptom could be missed.	3.7295944800191094
The hypothenar hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal arteria ulnaris.	4.204577664973056
Dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late.	4.120167589054227
There is no proven therapeutic procedure.	2.7348543882694356
Exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention.	5.86607324614979
The administration of epidural opioids is alternatively used in the management of postoperative analgesia.	3.8971909680523478
However, the administration is associated with side effects, including respiratory depression, somnolence and pruritus.	3.9199598915876774
A rational opioid selection between the hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids morphine, hydromorphone, alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil is discussed in this mini-review.	2.9642133492382627
Thus, the administration of the lipophilic opioid sufentanil might has some advantages.	3.5102381291595957
Notwithstanding, epidural opioid administration alone offers no marked clinical advantages compared to the intravenous route.	3.6282173610327617
In future, reduced doses of lipophilic opioids and local anaesthetics like bupivacaine 0.05-0.1% may provide benefits over the use of either drug alone and may offer marked clinical advantages over the intravenous route of opioids alone.	3.3004259006453487
The same holds true for  2-adrenoceptor agonists as adjuvants.	3.0388577444748344
However, multicenter dose-ranging studies are necessary to determine both the ideal concentrations of the drug combinations and the general outcome.	3.565453160091541
Moreover, we must also determine cost effectiveness for our postoperative analgesic techniques.	3.1766502949821276
Today the relevance of renal tumor embolization is not determined only by the technical and clinical success of the method.	3.83132063462662
Progress in diagnosis of early stages of renal carcinomas as well as the improvement of both surgical techniques and anesthetic procedures have lead to a change in the selection of patients for embolization.	5.029026470962097
Preoperative embolization of advanced renal cell carcinomas with tumor thrombus into the vena cava or of T4 tumors is now an established clinical procedure.	3.0729245804436305
The complete occlusion of the vascular bed of the tumors leads to a considerable reduction in intraoperative blood loss and to simplification of the surgical preparation.	4.487186156754008
By using Ethibloc for embolization, palliation of a hemorrhage or of tumor-related pain in inoperable patients is usually successful.	3.40474775846414
This short life expectancy in the group of inoperable patients has to be acknowledged individually in patients considered for palliative embolization who are free of symptoms related to the tumor.	4.077432724465111
Purpose: To evaluate whether primary stenting is superior to balloon angioplasty (PTA) alone in the treatment of femoropopliteal obstructive disease.	3.338388826779413
Robots in surgery allows the surgeon to transform the accuracy of the imaging systems directly during the intervention and to plan an intervention beforehand.	3.6895227313535597
In this paper firstly the state of the art is described.	2.8974562774387356
The paper closes with a outlook for future applications of robotics systems in maxillofacial surgery.	2.6688308266537835
Giant-cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern, frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given, and may potentially metastasize.	3.3454085515642524
By virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta-articular localization, giant-cell bone tumors require specific surgical management.	2.9718221030582708
Thus, an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone cementing, possibly combined with instillation of phenol or cryotherapy.	2.55977969505998
These combined treatment modalities assure a high-quality procedure, defined as the actual way medical care is delivered, by promoting the quality of the outcome, defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient's state of health.	4.242642707260098
We report two patients with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 7 and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 17.	3.176246999490586
Chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 17 in the parents and other relatives.	3.5312416211835504
Pedigree analysis reveals abortions, frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths.	3.0605291779489345
Our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms: prominent forehead, hydrocephalus internus with wide cranial sutures and fontanels, hypertelorism, cleft soft palate, low set dysmorphic ears, psychomotor retardation and micrognathie.	2.7810656622804064
Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are endowed with impressive metastatic potential.	3.113371623261472
Patients with RCC who present with apparently solitary metastatic lesions represent a small cohort.	2.9429309823049823
Due to the different long-term results achieved with surgical resection of metastatic RCC lesions, a generally accepted judgement about this treatment modality is not possible.	3.7107112207957766
Several studies suggest that aggressive surgical management can provide an effective treatment, especially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases.	4.412321853377939
Most noteworthy is the fact that because of the organ distribution of RCC metastases, surgical therapy is dominated by general and thoracic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and orthopaedic surgeons.	3.5968092079852876
Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is one of the most important key points for a successful outcome in these patients.	3.5966343677251222
The term Langerhans cell histiocytosis, previously "Histiocytosis X", encompasses three different syndromes: eosinophilic granuloma of bone, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Abt-Letterer Siwe disease.	2.5916944977239535
All are rare manifestations in childhood.	3.4601242484444374
We report on a 10 year old boy presenting with a swelling in the occipital region and clinical signs of elevated intracranial pressure.	3.2564275803702167
The tentative diagnosis after examination, conventional radiologic procedures and computerized tomography was eosinophilic granuloma.	2.955590939436956
Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging-angiography revealed the acute threat to the child caused by the intracranial expanding mass lesion with almost complete obstruction of the confluens sinuum.	3.5695355716480672
Thrombosis and the risk of bleeding were decreased by early and complete exstirpation of the tumor.	3.652800047632675
After two years follow-up, no new lesions had appeared.	3.4945744716803273
The diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen is a rare splenic proliferation.	3.6230038316400606
Spontaneous rupture is the main, potentially lethal complication, found in 25 % of cases.	3.7125177085886807
The problem with these vascular tumors is preoperative diagnosis, because they are asymptomatic for a long time.	3.166168919573319
First-choice therapy is limited resection.	3.715959953076152
In the case of rupture, splenectomy is a life-saving procedure.	3.5120038441422357
We report on a 56-year-old woman with a spontaneous splenic rupture as the first symptom of diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen.	2.637170021218751
Exceptional features of splenic hemangiomas, causes of spontaneous rupture and the therapy are described.	3.330424533676513
The hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a T cell mediated disease has led to the development of numerous therapeutic approaches that target the function of T cells.	3.643751072622239
The development of monoclonal antibodies against the T cell surface molecule CD4 has raised hopes to achieve a major progress in the treatment of RA.	3.9498842398782603
However, after encouraging results in early open studies, double blind trials were unable to demonstrate the efficacy of anti-CD4-therapy in RA.	3.5927822207306797
There are numerous reasons to explain the failure of this treatment approach.	3.652131878328302
Besides the fact that the T cell hypothesis of RA has  repeatedly been challenged, pharmacological problems or an inappropriate selection of outcome criteria have to be considered.	2.9958218968155874
One of these systems is the POLY-MESAM unit (MAP, Germany).	2.962434248270125
A large number of G protein-linked receptors funnel extra-cellular signals as diverse as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and primary sensory stimuli through a set of G proteins to a small number of second-messenger systems.	3.0277465045062963
The G proteins act as molecular switches with an "on" and "off" state governed by a GTPase cycle.	2.9293570396717663
By virtue of its high affinity and specificity for guanine nucleotide binding and its intrinsic GTPase activity, the -subunit of the G protein (G) plays the critical role in regulation of the effectors by their corresponding G protein.	2.995244349979399
Mutations of G may result in either constitutive activation or loss of expression mutations.	3.3653423648124106
Given the variety of functions subserved by G protein-coupled signal transduction, it is not surprising that abnormalities in G protein-coupled pathways can lead to diseases with manifestations as dissimilar as blindness, hormone resistance, precocious puberty and neoplasia.	3.01779369278482
For a given defect in a G protein-coupled pathway, the extent of the manifestations will also be determined by the cellular distribution of the affected component.	3.7868928895423366
Defects in components expressed exclusively in a single cell type will cause more a focal disorder than defects in a widely expressed component, particularly in germline mutations (e.g., Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy), whereas somatic mutations of genes encoding even an ubiquitously expressed component can cause focal disease when the somatic mutation itself is focal (e.g., McCune-Albright syndrome).	2.908320838629577
After 2.5 times the ED95 (0.2 mg/kg), tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2-3 min following injection.	3.583544385422188
The ensuing DUR 25% (i.e., time from injection to 25% recovery of control twitch tension) is three times as long as with succinylcholine.	3.119598113476968
The principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to moderate histamine release following doses 3-4 times the ED95.	3.300528445608795
In patients with end-stage liver or renal disease as well as those with atypical plasma cholinesterase, the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged.	3.514915319870156
The performance of new cryoprobes was studied by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of the temperature distribution in liver tissue around one to three active cryoprobes.	3.3605027476713256
After 15 min of maximal freezing a tissue region 22 mm in diameter was frozen to temperatures below - 50  °C by one active cryoprobe.	2.7773441534535177
With three cryoprobes, using the synergistic cooling effect, a tissue region 45 mm in diameter was cooled to temperatures below - 50  °C.	3.002272539052927
Optimal placement of the cryoprobes was found to be of critical importance.	4.516256510526064
The adult attachment interview was used plus an additional question about wishes for the future.	3.0298388254433033
Coherent correlations with subjective life satisfaction and individual future perspective were demonstrated.	3.172167578863102
Elderly participants with secure attachment representation were more satisfied, they were also less anxious, and more often positive about their future.	3.3258721997878182
Magnetic resonance imaging represents today the most important tool in neuroradiology for both clinical pratice and research.	3.281879290267533
MRI allows imaging of the human body in 2 or 3 dimensions with variable tissue contrast.	4.242596701067628
The natural diffusion of tissue protons can now be used as a supplementary contrast mechanism.	3.5191415116521716
Different MRI techniques can be used to obtain clinically useful diffusion-weighted images.	3.446737175143261
These techniques all require the use of strong gradient pulses in order to obtain the diffusion contrast.	3.893343746189053
In the current article, the most important physical principles of diffusion measurement are presented.	3.4643087301878746
After a short introduction into the basic physical principles, we will present the prerequisites and limitations of clinically relevant applications today.	3.4011751642665646
Finally a few select examples of clinical use of these techniques in the acute diagnosis of stroke will be presented.	4.094923436259138
The effects of chronical strains on physical or psychological health are subject of this paper.	3.015983067901437
Stress-related symptoms of family caregivers of dementia patients have been proven in various studies.	3.7924131883870134
For this group of people an analysis of the health risc factors is regarded as to be especially important.	4.292400182697363
Diary investigations allow to identify the individual assessment (by the caring person) of factors related to the care situation and to recognize the health and quality of sleep have been used as indicators regarding the state of health.	4.165346246074474
In this study strong differences in the individual view of stress factors and their effects on psychological an physical state of the caring person are shown.	3.430709555512958
The causes of residual deformity with posttraumatic painful arthritis after tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) fracture-dislocation with the need for correctional arthrodesis are in our experience (22 cases over 5 years) overseen injuries in one third, closed reduction and immobilisation or inadequate fixation technique with K-wires in another two thirds of cases.	3.0672231945059334
Foot malalignment and residual instability is assessed with weight-bearing radiographs of both feet, adduction/abduction stress films and CT scans for complex deformity.	3.180257738808325
Correction is carried out via two longitudinal dorsal incisions, strict epiperiosteal preparation and debridement of the Lisfranc joint of all remaining cartilage, sclerosis and fibrous tissue.	2.791448017780215
Reorientation begins, in the same manner as primary open reduction, with anatomical alignment of the second metatarsal base to the second cuneiform.	4.42559711488434
Defects are filled with autologous bone grafting, stable fusion can be achieved with 3.5 mm cancellous compression screws.	3.4705558193135584
Full weight bearing is allowed in a modelled plaster shoe for 6 to 8 weeks.	3.0403020170051485
The functional medium-term results are convincing with 15 of 17 patients seen after 13 months of follow-up working full time.	3.8711348971342088
The Maryland Foot Score improved from 38.9 to 76.8 points in these patients.	2.823162280906529
The author of this paper deems it very necessary to rename Chinese Tuina, a traditional Chinese medical subject, so as to make Chinese Tuina conform to recent research results and formulation, as well as to combine Chinese Tuina with Western manual medicine at the clinic.	3.0638689269966894
This paper is the result of my research during the period of time was in Switzerland working together with Prof. Jiri Dvorak.	3.242261569200427
The operability of a liver tumour depends on its three-dimensional relation to the intrahepatic vascular trees which define autonomously functioning liver (sub-)segments.	3.228334737323953
The aim of our study was to establish a computer-based three-dimensional volumetric operation planning system for the liver.	3.2208484451622255
Methods: Using data from routine helical CT scans the three tissue subclasses of liver parenchyma, liver vessels and liver tumour were segmented semiautomatically.	2.9362330303062327
A dedicated segmenting tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an "intelligent" border finder.	3.146065933412278
Visualisation is performed by the "Heidelberg Raytracer".	4.13152134905536
The vascular trees are visualised as 3D graphs.	2.973109765868375
Pseudoconnections between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically.	3.2263340150520627
Security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal.	3.331474471513512
Results: The 3D anatomy of the liver can be visualised in high quality resulting in good depth perception.	3.3581979608117773
Dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees.	3.895982994367911
The system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour, security margin and dependent liver parenchyma.	2.99548915357433
Conclusion: Three-dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology.	3.84001684594574
Virtual reality combined with artifical intelligence allows calculation of complete resection protocols, which can be quantified and modified interactively.	3.29880582512337
This will make operation planning more objective; patient selection may be improved, and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested.	3.8284718165728164
Thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching, surgical training and planning.	3.1174980185498047
It may lead to improved surgical care.	3.9960342389551613
Methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing.	3.871177006381127
P-wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting.	3.9690615932138478
However, correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p-wave analysis with the high resolution ECG.	3.337005856996269
Signal averaging triggered to the p-wave is significantly superior to QRS-triggering.	3.288207644196872
Bidirectional filtering or FIR-filtering is necessary.	3.1416832833843724
The data indicate significant differences in p-wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation.	3.3271354020303554
Class I antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p-wave duration, but did not influence spectral parameters.	3.2265016859716433
Treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p-wave energy without altering p-wave duration.	3.157687614823328
After optimizing the methods, p-wave analysis offers promise to separate patients prone to atrial fibrillation and normals.	3.373146680117052
In addition, the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible.	4.043059224387187
In the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit.	2.911352283849382
These may be fatal in patients treated conservatively with anticoagulation only.	3.99008099290993
In literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of 3 - 4%.	4.909447265884992
Extremely mobile, long, worm-shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus-related mortality rate which ranges from 30 - 40%.	3.3453923575206517
Current therapeutic strategies favour fibrinolytic therapy with consecutive anticoagulation.	3.3537730519102005
In the last years, several studies addressed the role of the different antithrombotic therapeutics in unstable angina pectoris.	3.7355561639668244
Acetylsalicylic acid still is the standard treatment reducing the rate of death and myocardial infarction by 50% in the first six months.	4.5746984958354195
Ticlopidin has no clinical effect in the first six days and therefore is not suited for treatment in the acute phase.	4.566752649543002
Unfractionated heparin has an additional favourable effect when added to aspirin.	3.1689216304366665
Low molecular weight-heparin is at least as effective as UF-heparin.	3.226851087515814
Direct thrombin-inhibitors (hirudin, hirudin-analoga) seem to be comparable to UF-heparin.	3.003698309404611
Pasminogen-activators should not be given in unstable angina, as they show a tendency to worsen the clinical outcome.	4.096969178368023
GP IIb/IIIa-antagonists (antibodies, synthetic antagonists) significantly improve the clinical effects of aspirin.	3.114807948185482
When combined with a reduced dose of heparin, their favourable effect remains unchanged, while bleeding complications are reduced to a minimum.	3.6585418214165015
The study presents data on cardiovascular malformations in Bavarian livebirths, born between 1984 and 1991.	3.071124751394726
Cases have been ascertained retrospectively by reviewing hospital records of all children being referred to a children's hospital up to 2 years of age.	3.1798901447124694
The classification scheme was based on abnormalities in developmental mechanisms.	3.4483619311419247
Severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with oral involvement often leads to dental destruction and restricted food intake, resulting in malnutrition and maldevelopment.	3.1048024144431756
We report on a now 13-year-old Turkish child with normal secondary dentition who had severely damaged primary dentition.	2.945387804524846
The teeth were treated surgically and then by continuous dental hygiene measures over the next 7 years.	3.4185950091320785
This care also resulted in an improvement in the nutritional state, associated anemia and the incidence of skin infections.	3.769224657138347
Although cutaneous blistering and scarring has been progressive, with resulting mutilation of the fingers, the child is socially well adjusted in school and family.	3.1542447347722167
Its clinical course demonstrates that the fate of patients with severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can be improved through multidisciplinary management.	3.8665798450201345
Our understanding of ulcer pathogenesis has dramatically changed since the discovery of Heliobacter pylori.	2.9968840627728395
Peptic ulcer is now recognized as a chronic gastric infectious disease.	3.345695325968322
H. pylori can be considered the pacemaker, with other known risk factors ultimately contributing to the ulcer formation.	3.997194913577852
Treatment of H. pylori in peptic ulcer disease cures the acute lesion and prevents relapse and complications.	2.8709297373679585
In clinical management a positive diagnosis of H. pylori is required and other potential causes for ulcer formation must be excluded before starting treatment.	3.1847265632632653
The standard treatment in H. pylori positive ulcer consists of PPI in standard dose and two antibiotics either clarithromycin 2 x 500 mg and amoxycillin 2 x 1 g or metronidazole 2 x 400 mg and clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg (or 500 mg) for 7 days.	2.7594502539311776
Following bleeding complication a PPI needs to be given beyond 7 days until ulcer healing is endoscopically confirmed.	3.196106910606886
We present the results of a study conducted in collaboration with the German workers' board to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in 477 cases.	3.990022217522928
The examiners reviewed the charts of patients who had suffered distorsion or luxation of the knee, fractures of the spine with or without neural deficits, calcaneus fractures, rotator cuff lesions and shoulder luxation, and fractures of the acetabulum and pelvis as the result of accidents.	4.219382330667206
A new documentation sheet was desiged to note administrative and medical data.	2.9230232324297316
All 477 patients' charts and X-rays were reviewed by three trauma surgeons, and procedures were monitored in a prospective manner.	3.5724754037499515
The study revealed considerable discrepancies between the assumed injuries and those ultimately found to have been sustained, especially in the case of knee injuries.	3.7146663893967595
The article reveals the results concerning the validity of the diagnosis and the need for more precisely tailored diagnostic methods for different patient groups.	3.9508753799083585
Our final conclusion is that it is necessary to implement new paths of patient management and better steering features to improve both the quality of medical care and the administrative procedures in place.	3.7503618823727805
A workshop on attenuated cold-adapted influenza virus vaccines (CAIV) was organized in Langen, Germany on December 16-17, 1998 by Prof. Reinhard Kurth, President of the Paul Ehrlich Institute.	2.6175042373289377
Reperfusion injury has become a scientific problem of increasing importance, in part because of recent developments of thrombolytic therapy.	3.7177980910846324
The mechanisms of reperfusion injury following focal cerebral ischemia, however, are not known in detail.	3.6519750087508416
Recent studies strongly suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium overload play an important role in reperfusion injury and that pharmacological interventions against calcium- or free radical-mediated damage could extend the therapeutic window in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.	2.8778907883088967
The mediators involved are known to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) during the reperfusion period, which is associated with uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a burst production of ROS, leading to cellular death.	3.8621047127999644
The mitochondrial PT is considered to be a key process in reperfusion injury following cerebral ischemia, as also observed in other organs such as heart and liver.	3.6845469863846216
Pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial permeability changes have the potential to reduce tissue damage due to reperfusion.	3.485304803387307
We performed an open clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a 1 µg/h ganciclovir implant for the treatment of newly and pretreated cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).	3.5494858002540552
The purpose of this study was to compare the initial stiffness of two techniques for posterior interbody lumbar fusion (PLIF) by a finite element approach.	2.644641620071053
Thus a finite element model of a human L3/4 spinal segment was generated.	3.3434143862729595
Stiffness of the intact model was tested under compression (600 N), torsion (25 Nm) and shearing forces (250 N) without preload.	3.1665532728496824
The results were compared to the stiffness following simulation of PLIF with two BAK-Cages and PLIF with two Harms-Cages and additional posterior screw-rod-osteosynthesis.	2.5702887531462513
PLIF with two BAK-Cages resulted in a loss of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	2.4774167379318284
PLIF with two Harms-Cages and posterior osteosynthesis resulted in an increase of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	2.726817921830692
Tramadol, an analgesic with mean potency one tenth that of morphine is used regularely for the treatment of chronic and postoperative pain.	3.4093642012652765
Previous reports have indicated that tramadol may induce seizure activity when given together with a selective serotonine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).	3.0698173607589307
Therefore, its major mode of action may be questioned which purportedly is due to binding with the opioid receptor and partly due to the inhibition of monoamine reuptake.	3.528187316245152
The article gives a short review on the history of the field.	3.4791107798870735
First forensic cases were solved by the use  of medicocriminal entomology in the thirteenth century but the method has only developed to a professional level over the last 100 years.	3.4216373573797525
In Europe, mainly French, Belgian, English and Scandinavian researchers have been responsible for maintaining the methods.	2.704471047011594
In France, an entomological police laboratory has been set up in Rosny-sous-bois.	2.8597874098397753
In contrast to the United States of America where entomological evidence is accepted by the courts, the method has only just started to be accepted in Germany.	2.980418414839394
27 patients with sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCC) and/or pustulotic arthroosteitis (PAO) were examined with whole body scintigraphy, conventional radiography, and other imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI.	4.1199602086030715
25 of 27 patients with SCCH showed a characteristic high bullhorn-like uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region with the manubrium sterni representing the skull and the inflamed sternocostoclavicular joints corresponding to the horns (=bullhorn-sign).	2.799973194150819
Scintigraphy revealed additional skeletal manifestations (spondylitis, sacroiliitis, osteitis, periostitis) in 19 of the 27 patients with SCCH and/or PAO.	3.3690335451293603
In combination with PPP or psoriasis pustulosa, the typical scintigraphic bullhorn pattern enables the diagnosis of PAO (19 patients) with high confidence.	3.5225335827586077
Patients with SCCH but without skin disease at the time of presentation (8 of 27 patients) may develop PPP later and, therefore, it is justified to classify them as incomplete PAO with high risk to develop other skeletal manifestations later in the course of the disease.	3.4702796486966654
PADAM stands for partial androgen deficiency in the aging male, and it is currently diagnosed with a testosterone level below 3 ng/ml (300 ng/dl or 12 nmol/l), and with symptoms varying according to the individual.	3.8555434894493468
The symptoms are a reduction or even loss of libido, a decline in muscle mass and strength, enhancement of visceral fatty tissue-padding, dryness of the skin, apathy, tiredness and distortion of mood right up to depression, and ostalgia due to osteoporosis.	3.0571367403628114
A 34 year-old pregnant woman presented with reticulate pigmentation of the flexures, the dorsum of the hands and the genitoperianal region.	3.000947435010285
Histologic examination of the hyperpigmented patches revealed pigmented filiform downgrowths of the interfollicular epidermis and follicular infundibula, as well as small epithelial cysts.	3.3707546715649945
Upon immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies, the number of melanocytes appeared normal.	4.000057014941391
The elongated dendritic processes of the melanocytes contained many mature melanosomes.	3.079631157576532
In the adjacent keratinocytes large melanosomes did not aggregate into complexes.	2.780889873208808
The diagnosis of localized reticulate pigmentary disorder was established.	2.923923212359047
The knowledge of the broad clinical spectrum of localized reticulate hyperpigmentations with its favorable prognosis is of practical importance.	3.1468590127123868
Genital or flexural pigmented lesions have to be differentiated from melanosis of the vulva or acanthosis nigricans.	3.342094548625485
The presented case gives further evidence that many of the proposed entities characterized clinically by reticulate pigmented macules and hyperkeratotic follicular lesions are different phenotypic expressions of the same autosomal dominant genodermatosis.	2.8656426597746445
Purpose: During the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life (QOL) data regarding surgical treatment.	3.3011796254667165
Therefore, the German Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was used to query the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to 1 year.	3.373954861697991
Results: Preoperatively, we found a low general GIQLI score (mean 92.7 points), which increased 6 weeks postoperatively (116.8 points), 3 months (124.8) and 1 year (mean 123.9 points) significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population (122.6 points).	3.735976308163363
Conclusion: It is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required Nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using QOL.	4.378457711971942
Introduction: Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign.	3.8549491275615466
Methods: We report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 12 patients with these tumors.	5.011390227866988
Results: Between October 1993 and December 1998, 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection; in 12 cases (11 women, 1 man) a serous cystadenoma (10 micrcocystic, 2 oligomacrocystic) was found.	3.4001054183165165
Only 6 (50 %) patients had symptoms.	3.7339617943164853
The mean tumor size was 4.8 (2.7-10) cm.	3.303374518688827
Ultrasound, CT and MRT usually could detect the mass, but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable.	3.452882255808572
All tumors were resected: 4 Whipple procedures, 7 distal pancreatectomies and 1 segmental resection were performed.	2.882677703998632
No patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on.	3.7105215400986755
Conclusions: Because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas, we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected.	3.920945791518376
We examined the prevalence of HIV-associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of UV-radiation in HIV-infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of 1310 patients seen between and 1994 and 1996.	3.7451743092297196
41 patients were treated with UVB-radiation and 4 patients with UVA1-radiation, while three patients received PUVA-therapy.	3.814358056058257
UV-radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	3.702802546302838
The staff at interventional radiological procedures is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation.	3.2013722202600072
This applies especially to measures at cardiac catheterization laboratories.	3.0731205944052418
In this study the annual radiation exposure to the staff was estimated by measuring the dose rate under characteristic conditions.	2.997567939043051
It could be shown that the resulting radiation exposure was strongly dependent on the radiation protection measures and is also dependent on the operation conditions of the x-ray tube.	3.7214331837366577
The effective dose for the physician wearing a lead apron and thyroid shield was detremined to about 1.7 mSva.	2.7629775300925608
Without a thyroid shield an effective dose of about 3.5 mSva resulted.	3.1995976162028503
This corresponds to approximately the natural background radiation of about 2.4 mSva in the Federal Republic of Germany.	2.8867033811703924
Further, it could be shown that the readings of the film badges, usually worn by the staff, underestimate the effective dose by approximately a factor of two.	3.014340185370304
This is because the film badges do not include the contribution of the unshielded parts of the body to effective dose.	3.112495011930309
From the estimated annual effective dose, a lifetime dose of 68 mSv was estimated for a 40-year working career.	2.97510063307785
The corresponding lifetime risk for induced fatal cancer due to radiation exposure was determined to 0.3% applying the ICRP risk factor of 4  -  10-2 Sv-1.	3.2343558842985374
Considering the NCRP recommendations for a safe occupation, working in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can be considered as safe when applying all radiation protection measures.	3.4373475732813876
However, changing the protection measures and modifying the parameters of the x-ray-tube can lead to strong changes of the radiation exposure and the resulting risk estimation.	4.017262494927176
Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is an important issue in intensive care.	4.132349258400473
One therapeutic regimen involves the intravenous administration of prostacyclin (PGI2).	2.997546579000493
This, however, is accompanied by diminished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, reduced arterial oxygenation, and systemic vasodilation.	3.8330305647995107
Thus, its clinical usefulness is limited.	3.395846354963702
However, the inhalation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) or nebulized PGI2 causes a selective pulmonary vasodilation in ventilated alveoli and improved gas exchange, without any systemic vasodilation.	2.661551439664737
It has therefore gained importance for the treatment of pulmonary failure associated with high shunt fractions.	4.171597055567724
However, the inhalation of vasodilators may have adverse effects: in the case of NO, toxic side effects are predominant (MetHb, NOx), whereas in the case of PGI2, technical problems in terms of dosing and administration safety are of major interest.	3.672963187815711
Furthermore, some patients do not respond to the treatment.	3.6200422033418835
In some individuals a reduction in pulmonary hypertension can be seen, while others lack even pulmonary vasodilation.	3.7116519537819888
The exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated.	3.2795342728094385
The treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms by means of transluminally placed endovascular prostheses reflects significant progress in the field of vascular surgery.	3.294091361075691
In the case of infrarenal aortic aneurysm it is possible to achieve technically successful implantation of such a prosthesis in well over 90 % of cases.	3.533641864510067
The rate of clinical success, meaning lasting effective exclusion of the aortic aneurysm, cannot (yet) be definitively determined, since no long-term results are so far available.	3.396047702284543
Secondary leaks are observed in at least 10 % of all patients, making a further therapy necessary (endorepair, conversion, embolization).	4.026490308658933
Further development of endovascular prostheses will include optimization of the aortal/iliac attachment of the prostheses, a better configuration and the development of long-lasting materials that can be used for endovascular prostheses.	4.081250973688676
The frequency of postspinal headaches after accidental puncture of the subarachnoid space with 16 - 18 G Tuohy needles is reported at 59 - 85%.	2.8068088831706874
A case of postspinal headache syndrome persisting over a period of 6 weeks following epidural anaesthesia during labour is described.	2.8668298470604094
A 30-year-old women had severe postspinal headache for 6 weeks after epidural anaesthesia during labour.	3.578618424114996
Intracranial haematoma and other abnormal processes were excluded by CCT.	3.3779857651780354
A pathologic EEG was not confirmed by cranial MRT.	3.1747617661004757
A lumbar epidural blood patch of 15 ml of autologous blood was performed at L3/4.	3.865645856523852
The patient stayed in bed for 12 h. After 3 h free of pain the patient complained of recurring headache.	3.268331273148677
After a further 48 h of bedrest she had recovered.	3.080195031982142
Because of lumbar pain 4 days after the epidural blood patch a MRT was performed, which showed the blood at L4 to S3 in the epidural space.	3.730725851802636
The diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage was based on the history and the main symptom of postspinal headache: the pain onset in the supine position.	3.7432512920780985
Such possible treatments as diminishing subarachnoidal pressure by bedrest, increasing cerebrospinal fluid production by infusions, increasing epidural pressure by epidural infusions and closing the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by epidural blood patch are discussed.	2.8604582639911245
The average success rate with the epidural blood patch is 93%.	3.258502388923891
Volumes ranging from 5 to 20 ml are discussed for the autologous blood.	3.4291660686380134
We were able to document the position of the blood patch as L4 to S3 on MR tomography (the injection site was L3/4).	3.3827234862771935
Most patients are free of headache 1 h after epidural blood patch.	3.294247227064974
The blood patch alone was not immediately sufficient to prevent all further cerebrospinal fluid leakage.	3.129596465608529
Probably more than one subarachnoidal puncture had been made during the difficult epidural anesthetic procedure.	3.5431970077084305
On the other hand, the leak was probably only diminished because of the blood patch descending down to the wide sacral space.	3.165097531345085
The combination of the large-volume blood patch, which diminished the leakage, and conservative treatment, which narrowed the transdural pressure difference, was successful: the 6-week postspinal headache was cured.	3.208321331468111
Prolonged postspinal headache should be treated by epidural blood patch.	3.465031277875127
Careful monitoring for side effects is necessary with blood volumes larger than 10 ml.	3.3918809835990698
If there is no immediate relief, conservative therapy with 24 - 48 h of bedrest is recommended.	3.307643127118056
If the headache persists a second blood patch should be performed, with the volume and the probable caudal spreading of the first taken into account.	4.056321159004536
The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability (HRV) and on left ventricular function in 14 patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).	3.2464285612571726
After a 3- to 4-week titration period, carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily, or the highest dose tolerated (at least 25mg daily).	3.335415983920185
Maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks.	3.76249225739904
Digital 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy.	3.5189906285057604
HRV for the entire 24-hour period was computed in the time domain using the Oxford Medilog Excel 2 analysis system.	3.3267798060957388
Measures of HRV included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), and the proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing >50ms (pNN50).	3.6205535334267434
The histologic determination of the degree of tissue anaplasia and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features (nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses, endothelial proliferation, tumor necrosis).	3.365719639306269
This grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist, especially concerning the weighting of criteria (scant, moderate, pronounced).	3.264576745061131
An observer-independent approach seems to be feasible by abandoning the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an binary approach noting only the presence or absence of these structure parameters.	3.290748992139438
This grading procedure is recognized in the revised WHO classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas (Ste.	3.1256049266031973
Anne-Mayo System, SAMS).	3.1579934262565703
Our results indicate that a similiar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas.	2.9310257048442567
Our recent investigations on glioma grading showed, both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, that a two-tiered grading scheme distinguishing only "low-grade" and "high-grade" cases was prognostically relevant.	3.4673258864887058
For all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in CT and MRI seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the "high" malignancy grade.	3.876243892221995
In patients with severe angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, who are not candidates for either percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) often leads to improvement of clinical symptoms and increased exercise capacity.	3.490131709071817
One drawback of TMR is the need for surgical thoracotomy in order to gain access to the epicardial survace of the heart.	3.7681811411501855
Therefore, a catheter-based system has been developed, which allows creation of laser channels into the myocardium from the left ventricular cavity.	3.461777858718745
Several phase III studies have proven that the beta-interferons have positive effects on the number and severity of acute exacerbations of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.	3.306021269278513
Recently the first study on the effectiveness of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was published.	3.917277688071901
In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 718 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) value between 3.0 and 6.5 were treated with either 8 Mio.	3.0651227295725505
interferon beta-1b or placebo subcutaneously every second day for two to three years.	3.2029330438593613
The primary study end-point was the time until confirmed progression of the disease as signified by a one point increase of the EDSS value (for initial EDSS values between 3.0 and 5.5) or 0.5 point increase when the initial EDSS value was between 6.0 and 6.5.	3.1992274294159486
After two years an interim analysis showed a highly significant difference in delay of disease progression by nine to twelve months for the treatment group (p=0.0008).	3.5641625081700865
This means that interferon beta-1b is the first recombinant beta-interferon to be shown effective in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.	3.6450177034447235
To test the effect of dorzolamide on accommodation or pupillary function.	3.2346378090774857
Cases of female patients who suppose having been sexually abused by their fathers during (early) childhood and wish to explore and work on healing this trauma are being discussed.	2.8970551306688197
As a result of projection and counter transference the therapist developes feelings of distrust, disbelief and of being involved in a "hysterical theatre performance" so that this sort of therapy is very difficult to conceive and carry out.	2.9079542806978034
In this contribution an attempt is being made to understand these patients and to examine their psychodynamic background as well as the deeper meaning of their above mentioned theatrical efforts.	3.353580839020649
On the basis of these cases we can put the following psychodynamic hypotheses: 1) The incest-phantasy is a narcissistic attempt; 2) The incest-phantasy is a symbolic representation; 3) in the sense of a symbolic wish-fullfillment included in the parent-child-interaction.	2.8914954952001226
After this, an attempt is being made to examine in various therapeutical scenes the role of these phantasis during the transference procedings and finally to develope diagnostic criteria with which these patients can be differentiated from others with definitely witnessed sexual abuse cases so that consequently treatment techniques can be devised in future.	3.062678828446438
Hospitals and clinics for ambulant surgery shall identify and register certain officially defined nosocomial infections (Surveillance) as well as the isolation of bacteria with special and important antimicrobial resistancies (§ 23 Abs.	2.954506301926137
1 IfSG = Infection Prevention Act).	3.0648925944095717
The nosocomial infections to be recorded, i. e device associated infections and postsurgical woundinfections, have been selected on the basis of national and international experiences with the surveillance of nosocomial infections.	3.593179356213344
Most of the relevant data may be provided by the clinical microbiology laboratory but shall be collected, listed and discussed by the staff of wards or surgery clinics.	3.104777876019436
Both types of documentation shall be used to identify and eradicate problems in hygiene management and to stop further distribution of difficult to treat bacteria like MRSA.They are part of the quality assurance management according to § 137 SGB V.	3.4529554453375098
Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world, e. g., south-east Asia, while they occur infrequently in western  Europe.	3.41068299426177
The association of NPCs with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a transforming human herpes virus, is well established.	2.9950742567365336
The current WHO classification recognises two major NPC histotypes, non-keratinising NPC and squamous cell NPC.	3.158712038879532
EBV is invariably present in non-keratinising NPCs and the viral oncoprotein LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1) is expressed in some cases.	3.9111275877685237
The tumour cells of non-keratinising NPCs show phenotypic features which are inducible by LMP-1 in  vitro.	3.075503030523236
These may contribute to the development of the lymphoid stroma which is characteristic of this tumour type.	3.8467432235312136
Furthermore, the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ.	2.6783133201610756
Thus, the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of  non-keratinising NPCs.	3.9167430485082906
By contrast, the association of squamous cell NPCs with EBV  displays a geographical variability.	3.40274290368357
It appears, therefore, that squamous cell NPCs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non-keratinising NPCs.	3.14121186705504
To assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors following postoperative external radiotherapy in 77 patients with low-grade glioma.	3.5603028039085047
Between 1977 and 1996, 45 patients with astrocytoma, 14 with oligodendroglioma and 18 with mixed glioma received postoperative radiotherapy with a median total dose of 52 Gy (range, 45 to 61 Gy).	3.443277805574913
Sixty-seven patients were treated immediately following surgery, 10 patients with tumor progression.	4.4203368187131735
The influence of various factors including histology, gender, age, seizures, duration of symptoms (<= 6 weeks vs > 6 weeks), CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement), type of surgery, total radiotherapy dose and timing of radiotherapy on relapse-free survival and overall survival was investigated.	3.195437150896581
The median overall survival time was 81 month, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 54% and 31%, respectively.	3.482364673165899
The median time to progression was 56 months, while the 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates were 45% and 24%.	3.2647716250496566
Univariate analyses identified the total radiotherapy dose (p = 0.01), duration of symptoms (p = 0.05), the presence of seizures (p = 0.04), and the CT pattern following intravenous contrast (p = 0.005) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival.	4.283240260858645
Progression-free survival rates were influenced by the total dose (p = 0.04), the duration of symptoms (p = 0.01) and CT pattern (p = 0.006).	4.493276404540751
On multivariate analysis, only the CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement) remained as independent prognostic factors for both progression-free survival and overall survival.	2.960592676891887
Tumors with CT enhancement seem to need further intensification of treatment.	2.966407340888458
We report three patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).	3.2436912051245272
On clinical examination, no sensory deficit was elicited.	3.616816717325173
Electromyography (EMG) and motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies were indicative of an axonal lesion.	3.0497592361407606
In two patients, we found total peripheral conduction block without volitional EMG activity.	3.6589662392894287
Sensory NCV and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal.	3.043477352023185
Therefore, these cases must bei classified as combined motor-sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings.	3.379733733306507
Although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred, causing tetraparalysis, this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant.	3.4305774390279624
In contrast to positive reports in literature, immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases.	3.114006206550428
Continuous spinal anaesthesia (CSA) is a further means of central nerve block for anaesthesia besides single-shot spinal (SSS), combined spinal/epidural, and epidural anaesthesia.	3.2000983000880376
Do hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected food handlers represent a risk for the consumer?	4.120273579891231
Epidemiological data on HCV transmission  in our opinion do not provide a basis for excluding HCV positive individuals from working as food handlers in general.	3.2907036988500424
Recently, good functional and anatomical results have been reported in treating full thickness macular holes.	3.4284902963975448
Only a few studies describe a removal of a membrane at the vitreoretinal interface after having removal of the vitreous and its cortex.	3.2590916069586053
To demonstrate the beneficial effects of removing this membrane at the vitreoretinal interface we present our functional and anatomical results in this retrospective study.	3.3195061640532613
Dementia-screening in clinical routine requires short, sensitive and specific tools.	3.602542402889976
The present study analysed the relationship between size of three examplary dementia-screening tests and their diagnostic accuracy.	3.204394718679061
A phlebological report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology.	3.6762265153202742
The most important, reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic phlebodynamometry and ascending pressure phlebography, as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made.	3.4120129416583014
Additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour- coded duplex sonography.	3.1564983601959558
A thrombophilic condition should always be investigated in terms of haemotasis.	3.984077086475952
In patients with severe post-thrombotic disease, a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with, and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and, if possible, dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination.	3.891606093077149
There is currently no generally valid schematization of the post-thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion.	2.952797111401721
When evaluating patients, we largely follow our own new classification, which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis.	3.2122527268125567
Since systemic treatment of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetics (DNPU) has so far been rather ineffective, recent reports of successful management of DNPU by short-term retrograde transvenous leg perfusions (RVP) by South American angiologists encouraged us to apply this treatment method in diabetics suffering from chronic DNPU.	2.9631484841493845
Hence, in a prospective comparative clinical trial started in 1989 we have treated 45 male diabetics suffering from DNPU with the same daily doses of netilmycin, administered either in systemic venous infusions (SVI: n=21, three times/day) or in RVP (n=24, once/day).	3.5057040879709582
After 10 consecutive days of treatment, ulcers had closed in 8 of the 24 patients treated with RVP, as against 3 of the 21 treated with SVI.	3.6904131592242027
Diminution of the ulcer area by >30% including full debridement was achieved in 10/24 of the RVP cases (SVI: 4/21).	3.4816505334478345
During 6 months of follow-up, amputation of toes or forefoot was necessary in only 1 patient in the RVP group, but in 4 in the SVI group.	4.1237032974448535
Partial restitution of osteolytic damage was observed in some cases after RVP.	4.104744076727828
Our results show that regional netilmycin therapy given by the RVP procedure is clearly superior to equal netilmycin doses administered by SVI for the treatment of DNPU.	3.187022138819706
RVP can be recommended in DNPU, particularly when the ulcers are complicated by infections.	3.825045960962231
There is hardly any other discipline that illustrates the conflict between the freedom of science and research, that is to say, ultimately, what is medically possible, and human dignity and the protection of life or, in other words, what can be justified in ethical or legal terms, so clearly as reproduction medicine.	3.0838144515769406
The topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum, ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective feticide, the many questions raised by assisted fertilization, and especially by anonymous sperm donation, and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation, to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis, some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts.	3.510586255338799
In a good many of these sectors it is difficult to reconcile what doctors can do and what it is admissible for them to do, so that it is hardly surprising that there is often no general consensus.	3.187549415958884
In MR-imaging, similar to computed tomography, diagnosis of metastatic lymph-node disease is based on lymph-node sizes, and thereby it is non-specific.	4.325127895257737
Superparamagnetic iron oxide as a potential contrast medium for MR-lymphography accumulate in normal lymph node tissue after endolymphatic, interstitial and, in case of very small particles, after intravenous injection.	3.4730691186939824
No accumulation occures in lymph node metastases.	3.5922009465996236
Lymph-node metastases can be detected by all three injection techniques.	3.800301066835531
It has been shown experimentally, that in particular small metastases can be detected in normal sized lymph nodes.	3.5843650981833894
However, MR-lymphography also has inherent methodologic problems, as there may occure an uneven distribution of the contrast medium between different lymph-node groups.	3.6456023772076374
The experimental results with endolymphatic, interstitial, and intravenous MR-lymphography as well as first clinical results with intravenous contrast medium injection are presented and discussed.	3.562389690120449
The purpose of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional results of vitreoretinal silicone oil surgery for complicated retinal detachments due to trauma and myopia in children and juveniles.	2.7684353883103916
Among 71 thoracoabdominal aortic reconstructions since 1993, 5 CEAD patients (median age 47.8 yr, mean CEAD- 6.5 cm, 4 with Marfan Syndrome) underwent TAP.	3.0195151582341784
Selection criteria are: 1.	3.650961306888454
CEAD- >5 cm 2. expansion rate >=5 mm/6 months 3. involvement of the critical aortic segment III/IV.	3.449823741173404
TAP consists of: 1. left posterolateral aortotomy from Th 8 - L 2, 2. excision of the intraaortic dissection membrane(s) 3. aortic closure to a diameter of 3 cm to reduce wall tension.	3.335338502575969
All 5 patients survived without any major complications, particularly no paraplegia.	3.4719211701604418
Mean cross-clamping was 43 min.	3.3869155642924302
After 7 months, 1 patient was successfully repaired due to false aneurysm at the distal thoracic graft suture line.	3.3700814472563314
After mean follow-up of 2.4 years, CT-angiography revealed a stable TAP segment (mean aortic- 3.2 cm) in 4 patients and one re-expanded TAP segment (from 4 cm after 24 months up to 7 cm) without signs of re-dissection.	3.413893924102153
Although one re-expanded TAP segment is disquieting, we found the short-term gains so rewarding to strongly advocate the tailored approach as a principle means of avoiding paraplegia in this extremely high risk group of patients.	3.0747369853484257
All optically active molecules have at least one asymmetric atom in common which is attached to four ligands, that can have different three dimensional positions.	3.22304583121245
Therefore it can be concluded that the resulting isomers are chemically identical in all respects except for the direction with which they rotate plane-polarized light.	3.0927254091912637
When the isomer and its corresponding enantiomer are present in equal proportions, they are called racemic mixture, a mixture that does not rotate polarized light, since the optical activities of the two isomers cancel each other.	3.213859500440286
Although the isomers are chemically identical other optically active molecules can interact with these isomers in a geometrically specific way termed stereoselectivity.	2.7026732661286537
The human body comprises a chiral environment due to optically active proteins; thus it is not surprising that enantiomeric drugs exhibit different pharmacological properties, when used as pure optical isomers.	2.9115761020505047
Till today most modern anaesthetics have been optical isomers, which are mainly used as racemic mixture (1:1 mixture).	3.461572171399031
For financial reasons pure isomers were only used for research purposes, but nowadays the wide clinical use of pure isomers is financially feasible due to new production techniques.	2.9129951046554976
The terms eutomer and distomer were chosen to indicate the more or less potent form of the drug.	3.5540950701122758
The clinical use of pure isomers is only of advisable, if there are significant differences between eutomer and distomer in desired or side effects.	3.0146598272485945
Among the modern anaesthetics ketamine, isoflurane, bupivacaine and atracurium exhibit an asymmetric carbon.	2.8990623752150118
For most drugs the separation in pure isomers will reduce side effects.	2.9105823276459852
For volatile anaesthetics this question is still unanswered, since experimental and clinical results are inconsistent so far.	3.3720208612867113
The high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in asthmatics and patients with nasal polyps as well as reports of familial clustering suggest a genetic disposition of this disease.	3.767821620740963
Our study aimed at obtaining further evidence of hereditary factors in this disease.	3.1601706740223925
We included 33 unselected patients from 28 families with aspirin intolerance and rhinosinusitis in this study.	2.9244159391239672
Controls were recruited from individuals treated in our ENT clinic for diseases other than aspirin intolerance (n=52).	3.1690648890623176
The application of a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture (tryptophan depletion test) induces a rapid and substantial lowering of both total and free plasma tryptophan.	3.1203369940302377
Consequently, the brain serotonin content and also cerebral serotonin function are decreased.	3.140779909610231
This method provides a paradigm to study the role of serotonin in the pathobiology of depressive disorders and their treatment modalities.	3.349070761033259
Untreated depressed patients show few behavioral effects during tryptophan depletion.	3.059972690378951
In depressed patients during an antidepressant or light-therapy-induced stable remission, a transient depressive relapse was induced by tryptophan depletion.	3.135623581636768
Healthy subjects with a genetic risk for affective disorder show worsening of their condition induced by tryptophan depletion.	3.112297521093616
These findings indicate the relevance of altered brain serotonin function in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and strengthen the importance of serotonin in the mechanism of action of antidepressants.	3.7081665075937456
Since recently published studies revealed some evidence that the serotonergic system is directly involved in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric syndromes besides depression, it seems to be reasonable to evaluate the validity of the tryptophan depletion test also in non-depressed patients.	3.952881491801916
Several common chronic pain syndromes come to the attention of the rheumatologist demanding for differentiation from fibromyalgia (FM), although they are often associated with it.	3.2336974634735216
They may mimick FM by (1) the occurance of wide spread pain, (2) the chronicity of complaints, (3) the preponderance of females in some of these, and (4) the lack of objective data to be derived from imaging techniques and laboratory tests.	3.7082327650974682
Pain is produced by the disturbance of normal function ("dysfunctional syndromes", MASI, ref.	3.310295943390535
Recognition requires examination of the locomotor system under biomechanical auspices both at rest and during movement in order to diagnose hyper- and hypomobility syndromes; treatment of these conditions is guided by principles to improve biomechanical function.	3.767286560620967
In addition, the skin needs to be examined to detect panniculosis (also called "cellulitis"), which may be mixed up with FM due to its preferential occurance in peri- or postmenopausal women.	3.452554799636941
It is concluded that the aforementioned differential diagnosis needs to be considered appropriately in coinciding FM and all studies dealing with FM.	3.08133722426254
Patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and/or PTCA because of severe/instable angina pectoris.	3.5858467170526707
In the control group, antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician.	3.304107310203295
Multiple sclerosis is a rare disease in childhood.	3.936411840647445
Abrupt vessel closure of the dilated vessel continues to represent a significant limitation of coronary angioplasty.	3.4026503596116235
Despite increasing operator experience and improved technology, abrupt vessel closure continues to represent the most important complication of balloon angioplasty.	3.7161812786123023
Intracoronary stent implantation and pharmaceutical blockade of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor serve as effective tools in the prevention of abrupt vessel closure without completely resolving this problem.	3.1490541814088115
About 50% of patients presenting with abrupt vessel closure exhibit additional complications including myocardial infarction, necessity of CABG or death occurring in up to 10% of acute occlusions.	3.44608469959129
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if quantitative coronary angiography and assessment of clinical and laboratory data allows risk stratification concerning the probability of abrupt vessel closure.	3.4511169202998775
PTCA in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of abrupt vessel closure, indicating that different risk factors may contribute to the development of abrupt vessel closure in patients presenting with stable angina or acute coronary insufficiency syndromes.	4.235774015005193
Since the skin dose becomes the limiting factor while deciding the tumorcidal dose, the detailed analysis of dose distribution in the build-up region is necessary for high-energy photon beams.	3.186677890930173
In this study the beam characteriwstics affecting the build-up and skin dose for 6- and 18-MV photons are analyzed.	2.8171474014338087
Measurements were made with 6- and 18-MV photons using a PTW parallel-plate ionization chamber (B23344-036) and a RDM-1F electrometer.	2.9407683517801324
Build-up ionization measurements were made with the chamber fitted into a 25 x 25 x 25 cm polystyrene phantom with a fixed SSD of 100 cm.	3.044521852866045
The entrance and buildup dose measurements were made with a polycarbonate and a mesh type metallic shielding tray and a 45 ° wedge.	2.929964135642596
Exit dose measurements were carried out for the graphite patient supporting assembly table top, 1.0 cm thick piece of wood and the 1.0 cm thick patient supporting perspex base frame for head and neck treatments.	3.1688337870937944
It was observed that the dmax decreased slightly with field size as with other accelerators.	3.1309649608722188
For both photon energies the surface dose was observed to increase with increase in field size.	3.436075544625338
It was also noticed that the dose in the build-up region increases slightly when the polycarbonate secondary blocking tray is introduced with the increase in surface dose.	3.0621621251373594
The data show that the tray pertubation factor (TPF) at surface decreases steadily with tray-surface distance for both photon beams for all field sizes.	2.9058798601148776
It was noted that the TPF was more when the polycarbonate tray was introduced at shorter tray-surface distances for both energies.	2.8352847240542864
At tray-surface distances above 60 cm the TPF almost remained close to unity for 6-MV photons for all field sizes, whereas the continuous decrease in TPF could be noted for 18-MV photon beams even after the TPF rewached unity.	3.115301424666571
The increase in surface dose with field size for both photon energies is due to the electron scattering from the intervening materials.	3.266090613727249
The increase in dose enhancement percentage with graphite compared to perspex supporting assembly indicates that the electron backscatter is proportional to the atomic number of the medium.	2.744025750088891
We investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet (diet I) adapted to nutritional habits in Germany.	3.049292297449098
Data were compared to a low fat diet (diet II) according to the American Heart Association.	3.928886185300085
The study was performed in 37 patients with coronary heart disease (30 males and 7 females, age 45-83 yrs) stratified to the 2 dietary treatments.	3.479057856018958
Daily fat intake was 38g (24% of energy intake of 6.5MJ/d) in diet I and 60g (31% of 7.3MJ/d) in diet II (p<0.01), respectively.	2.788099443968887
When compared with dietII, in dietI the intake of cholesterol, saturated and monunsaturated fatty acids, Vit.	2.722048642492563
B12 were all reduced (p<0.01), whereas the uptake of Vit.	4.22592988532048
C was increased p<0.01.	3.720512547312019
The intake of folic acid was low in both groups.	3.0401879553935895
Both diets resulted in a decrease in BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels.	3.6648328890409276
Reduction of BMI and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline BMI and cholesterol concentrations, respectively.	2.9039132965079424
The cholesterol lowering effect of diet I is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet.	3.562475811232631
Taking into account the nutritional habits in Germany, very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value.	3.566850386830299
Both diets are effective in lowering body weight, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels without affecting HDL cholesterol.	2.966880621695518
These effects are most pronounced in overweight and hypercholesterolemic patients.	3.1266061397682092
Besides autopsy determined findings of a fibro-fatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium, no assured clinical evidence of arrhythmogenie right ventricular dysplasia-cardiomyopathy (ARVD) exists yet.	3.1158341870035
Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AVRD were complied in 1994 by members of the ISFC work group and the European Association for Cardiology.	3.4750727854583383
These criteria include structural, functional, histological, and electrophysiological abnormalities, which were divided into major and minor criteria.	3.554075726975613
With the successive examination of a collective of 24 patients with a histologically determined diagnosis of ARVD at the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seien, France, the value of the complied criteria were checked.	3.3627631265588325
Global or segmental dilatation of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be proven in 20 patients (83%) using angiography or electrocardiography.	3.9921685944660337
Four patients (16%) exhibited only minor criteria in the radionuclear angioscintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disturbances of the right ventricular.	3.7217222493778843
In all patients, the typical fibrofatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium could be histologically determined.	3.5425583423034355
A localized QRS-widening of more than 110ms in V1 to V3 in 8 patients (33%) and an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) were observed as major criteria.	3.5484808442825524
A late potential analysis using signal averaged ECG was only present in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of minor criteria.	4.0642378007116955
Left bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia, which was classified as a minor criterion, was observed in 23 patients (96%); only one patient died without proven arrhythmia from rapidly progressing heart failure.	3.953877090307509
A previous history of unexpected sudden death in family members as a minor criterion arose in 3 of 19 patients (15%).	3.596178937746928
The complied task force criteria for the diagnosis of AVRD led in all 24 cases to the diagnosis of the disease, whereby the value of a determined histological diagnosis was the gold standard.	4.44322436242479
Without inclusion of histological data, the clinical diagnosis was determined in only 10 cases.	4.251350397523046
The question remains whether with a simple division of findings into major and minor criteria a pure clinical diagnosis is possible.	2.9827802870380418
Subungual keratoacanthomas (SKA) differ in clinical presentation, biological behaviour and the therapy needed from keratoacanthomas in other localizations.	3.3262750048918126
Against the backdrop of two personal observations and a review of the literature, the authors describe clinical and histological features and also the differential diagnosis and therapy and this rare benign neoplasm.	3.6207824710071304
Patients present with a rapidly growing, painful subungual mass, which causes destruction of the underlying bone and usually does not regress spontaneously.	3.450243424819134
Histological differentiation from squamous cell carcinoma is essential as the prognosis and treatment are different.	4.2533803633917975
SKA is treated by local excision and curettage.	3.580708440322978
Erosions of the underlying distal phalanx usually heal spontaneously.	3.6095273704666426
Leukotrienes and prostaglandines are important mediators of inflammation.	3.259168306555272
While prostaglandine synthesis can be influenced by NSAIDs therapeutical approaches to the 5-lipoxygenase pathway are rare.	3.469778239985145
Resinous extracts of Boswellia serrata (H15, indish incense), known from traditional ayurvedic medicine, decrease leukotriene synthesis in vitro.	2.7603841292790694
Case reports suggest a clinical role for that drug.	3.1962147065511073
Methods: Outpatients with active RA have been enrolled into a multicenter controlled trial.	3.0179701980927285
Patients received 9 tablets of active drug (3600 mg) or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy.	3.510302013032442
Doses of NSAIDs could be adjusted on demand.	3.364711368972804
Efficacy parameters, Ritchies Index for swelling and pain, ESR, CRP, pain on VAS and NSAID dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation.	3.1690888083703714
Only 37 patients (verum 18, placebo 19), enrolled in Ratingen were available for detailled efficacy and safety analysis.	3.356648820876269
All evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator (G.H.).	4.190715913037407
There was no subjective, clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.	3.047299950021242
The mean NSAID dose reduction reached levels of 5.8% (H15) and 3.1% (placebo).	2.7935585070259115
One patient in each group showed a good response in all parameters but 4 patients in each group worsened.	3.882550874849316
The others showed no alteration of their disease.	3.229664315836615
Conclusion: Treatment with H15 showed no measurable efficacy.	2.9238007102829
Controlled studies including a greater patient population are necessary to confirm or reject our results.	3.4484025494834554
A 61-year-old woman with depression developed recurring elevated itching erythematous lesions in light-exposed areas after taking St. John's Wort-extract for three years.	2.804035013402943
Routine patchtesting did not reveal any relevant reactions and photopatch testing was negative.	3.0607002796786986
Using a systemic oral photoprovocation test with St. John's Wort, we were able to demonstrate a decrease of the MED-UVB which was reversible after withdrawal of the medication.	3.0930464856578928
Due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques.	3.01476717394874
High flow phases for wash-in or wash-out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short, the difference between the volatile's concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small, and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia.	3.6473064859953848
The monitoring, required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients, corresponds to the current obliging technical safety standards.	3.8097811166303703
As compound A may accumulate in the breathing system, sevoflurane should not be administered with fresh gas flows lower than 1.0 l/min, until the scientific discussion on nephrotoxicity of this substance in humans is solved.	3.4280975595579695
Low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash-out of trace gases.	3.12457275031463
Thoroughly the use of sevoflurane with dry soda lime must be avoided, as this volatile in an extreme exothermic reaction is absorbed nearly totally and degraded to a considerable degree by dry carbon dioxide absorbent.	3.198355732149477
The gaseous degradation products are pungent and possibly may be harmful to the patients.	3.3269355929052438
Only by low flow anaesthesia the use of sevoflurane will gain an economically and ecologically acceptable range of efficiency.	3.4531551408175685
Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.	3.210687583439875
The typical delay from the onset of acute infarction to the development of cardiogenic shock and well defined risk factors allow for an early identification of patients at risk.	3.724371343887407
Immediate restoration of coronary artery patency by thrombolysis or PTCA can prevent cardiogenic shock in a number of these patients.	3.7450907697377755
Patients presenting with frank cardiogenic shock should be approached with diagnostic vigor in an attempt to identify a treatable lesion.	2.8465246487318963
Several non-randomized studies suggest that PTCA is superior to thrombolysis in patients with shock and ongoing ischemia.	3.863570201526894
However, aortic counterpulsation may enhance reperfusion rates achieved by thrombolytic therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock.	3.2406292351536337
Early surgery is required in patients with shock due to mechanical complications, such as acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum.	4.370158420944516
Ventricular assist devices can be used in selected patients with refractory shock as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.	3.793043799460079
Right atrial thrombi are rare, but potentially life-threatening complications of ventriculoatrial shunts.	3.4423562926309215
We report on a 4.6 year old girl, presenting with signs of subacute valve malfunction; in her cerebrospinal fluid koagulase-negative staphylococcus could be cultured, and the CF protein was elevated.	3.0986734161519482
Bidimensional echocardiography demonstrated a large thrombus on the distal part of the shunt.	3.7894411900074703
The thrombus protruded into the right ventricle during diastole.	3.576067020881694
The child underwent cardiotomy and thrombectomy.	3.181982931886902
Object of this review is to present the physiological principles, diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis.	3.916635675907223
Despite intense research activities in this area, many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear.	3.615630308306924
For example, the often discussed shift of the critical value of oxygen delivery to higher values in sepsis has not been proven, yet.	3.5305508481380388
Beside an impaired regional perfusion also disturbances in the cellular oxygen utilization may be responsible for organ failure in sepsis.	3.5070334704472605
Until now, it was not shown, whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients.	3.440959543808521
It is also unknown, which catecholamine and which infusion solution is suitable for the treatment of septic patients.	3.9394034607662296
In future further research is necessary to solve the problems associated with sepsis therapy.	3.6691090984450656
The rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration is a quite involved procedure associated with many potential dangers.	3.074167808031757
A new nasogastric balloon tube has been developed, which will prevent the reflux of gastric contents by blocking the cardia with a balloon.	3.0029467319861918
It was the aim of this initial study to assess the efficiency of the tube in animals, healthy volunteers and patients.	4.068189908630337
With the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee, a total of 16 anaesthetised pigs were used for the animal experiments.	3.4668211741674715
Balloon occlusion of the cardia was performed in 10 pigs.	4.729955567093346
Six further pigs with an unblocked cardia served as controls.	2.9139317147235237
Vomiting and regurgitation was provoked in each animal using six different manoeuvres while the gastro-oesophageal (lower oesophageal) sphincter and intragastric pressures were monitored and the lower oesophagus was continuously inspected using an endoscope.	2.887723077037365
With local Ethics Committee approval and informed written consent, (1) repeated vomiting was provoked in 16 awake, healthy adult volunteers (10 females, 6 males, 29 +/- 4 years) with a fluid-filled stomach in the presence and in the absence of balloon occlusion of the cardia, while intragastric pressure was monitored, and (2) 30 patients (21 - 89 years) with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration scheduled for abdominal or traumatologic surgery received conventional induction of anesthesia after blocking of the cardia with the balloon.	3.828346749731854
Pigs (n=10) with a blocked cardia showed no gastrooesophageal reflux during a total of 60 manipulations to provoke vomiting and regurgitation, while 28 of the 36 provoking manipulations induced reflux in pigs (n=6) with an unblocked cardia.	3.7918149532467376
Among the healthy volunteers with a blocked cardia (n=16), reflux of gastric contents was not observed during repeated attempts to stimulate vomiting.	3.2175983968059594
After termination of the occlusion of the cardia, reflux was able to be induced by 14 of the 16 volunteers.	3.425581966004274
In 30 patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration the cardia was blocked and anaesthesia was induced using a mask and manual ventilation without encountering any problems.	3.1105302822475918
The average time from loss of consciousness to tracheal intubation was 164 +/- 8 s. Conclusions.	3.553195922813039
It is concluded from the present results, with further clinical studies pending, that the gastric balloon probe permits low-risk conventional induction sequence of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk for pulmonary aspiration and that the device may also be safely used during the extubation phase.	3.8526219771880137
The article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by Weiss and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioristic theories and therapeutic techniques.	3.0792106374006405
The basic assumption is: pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals.	3.16828542667441
Patients are unconsciously motivated to overcome pathogenic beliefs.	2.9659405715969887
In psychotherapy, the patient works to disprove pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist.	3.7040856463928655
In this way patients achieve corrective emotional experiences.	2.823462556994617
The theory is supported by numerous empirical studies.	3.316055363446849
To define the potential usefulness of nootropic drugs, effects and side effects, economic aspects in comparison to other treatment approaches were studied.	3.8157400211358032
A summary of literature published concerning these criteria underlines the efficacy of nootropics in improving the symptoms at the beginning and in postponing the progress of the disease.	3.190372401875526
The majority of substances does not lead to severe side effects.	2.9675717604329384
There are not enough studies comparing the effects of the substances or on prophylactic effects.	4.115682574177948
Delayed admission to care units leads to a positi- ve cost effect of nootropics.	3.2936497002413407
Thus, also for economic reasons it seems advisable to treat patients with nootropics.	3.274209620684447
Better effects are gained when nootropic treatment is combined with training and changing of the structure of the environment.	3.4634054696187677
A proposal for a rational treatment with nootropics is derived from the data.	3.5091038981409257
Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) as a contrast for magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and the use of high-dose dynamic studies for predicting the response to preoperative chemotherapy.	3.952905214375334
Simulation has gained an important role in medical education and continuing education in the field of anaesthesia and emergency medicine.	4.303276255585274
This article gives background information on how full-scale simulators are applied in medical education as well as in continuing education for advanced anesthesia and scientific applications.	3.276883439928143
Acceptance of training seems enhanced by inclusion of the human factor aspect, since this has proven  to be a major source for the development of critical situations in our specialty.	4.3843911194777245
We evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure (ptiO2) and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in ten anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits (body weight 2.5 +/- 0.5 kg).	2.761737320599885
CBF [hydrogen desaturation (clearance)-technique) and ptiO2 (Licox-microsensor) right frontoparietal cortex] were determined.	2.8651355200591744
After median sternotomy, the animals were placed on CPB (standard roller pump, nonpulsatile, -stat acid-base management, perfusion flow of 180-200 mL/kg/min, right atrial and aortic cannulation) for induction of DHCA by cooling to 15 °C rectal temperature (1 °C per minute).	3.0096878500624404
Rewarming period was started after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest and the rabbits were weaned from CPB without the use of any inotropic or vasoactive support.	3.2609695205446796
Under baseline conditions, ptiO2 was 38 +/- 5 mmHg and did not change significantly before DHCA.	3.06473607698247
During DHCA the ptiO2 decreased within 15 minutes to 14 +/- 5 mmHg, after 30 minutes to 5 +/- 1 mmHg and after 40 minutes to zero.	3.4329753122991185
Neither the ptiO2 nor CBF recovered fully following restoration of bypass flow and reperfusion: ptiO2 (25 +/- 4 mmHg vs. baseline: 38 +/- 5 mmHg, p<0.05) and CBF (43 +/- 8 vs. baseline: 68 +/- 11 ml/100 g/min, p<0.05) were significantly reduced.	3.52930577367904
Arterial and jugular-venous lactate levels increased after rewarming (p<0.05) and corresponded to the appearance of a anaerobic metabolism.	3.2759548004391035
These data demonstrate significantly decreased levels of ptiO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) and CBF (oxygen supply) during and after rewarming from DHCA.	2.9753047534191484
Thus, a direct influence on brain functional recovery by the active cooling and rewarming process about the bloodstream during CPB, resulting in disturbed tissue blood redistribution, mitochondrial dysfunction and/or excessive cerebral oxygen consumption (compensation of an oxygen debt) is a possible explanation.	3.397369878948776
While initially advocated primarily for intrasurgical visualization (e. g., craniotomy), interventional MRI rapidly evolved into roles in image-guided localization for needle-based procedures, minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures, and thermal ablation of cancer.	2.865609961085674
In this contest, MRI pulse sequences and scanning methods serve one of four primary roles: (1) speed improvement, (2) device localization, (3) anatomy/lesion differentiation and (4) temperature sensitivity.	3.5313368603071664
A 74-years old patient is admitted to the hospital with a over a period of 4 years growing, scrotal, ulcerated tumor.	3.385543009495691
There is no connection to the testicle or the epididymis palpable.	2.8408854220539297
All laboratory findings including the tumorparameters are normal.	3.1715446709897925
The complete tumor resection with histological examination leads to the diagnosis of a scrotal leiomyoma.	4.039654356857134
This rare, benign tumor is a differential diagnosis to paratesticular or non-germinal tumors.	3.5659151506771627
This review summarizes vascular tumours of skin and soft tissues that have been characterised in recent years.	3.2032766585797465
Although most of them are very rare, knowledge about their reproducible clinicopathological features is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls.	3.8725073185205607
These lesions include: bacillary angiomatosis, a vasoproliferative, pseudoneoplastic infection of immunocompromised patients caused by Rochalimaea henselae; tufted angioma, a variant of lobular capillary haemangioma characterised by a "cannon-ball" distribution of multiple lobules composed of packed capillaries and pericytes; microvenular haemangioma, a cutaneous haemangioma composed of thin-walled and irregularly branching blood vessels which dissect dermal collagen; sinusoidal haemangioma, a distinctive variant of cavernous haemangioma which may be located in the subcutaneous breast tissue and then may be confused with well-differentiated angiosarcoma; "hobnail haemangioma" (targetoid haemosiderotic haemangioma), a benign vascular tumour with a distinctive clinical targetoid appearance and a hobnail cytomorphology of the prominent endothelial tumour cells; retiform haemangioendothelioma, a very recently characterised low-grade angiosarcoma occurring most commonly in the extremities of adolescents which is characterised by arborising blood vessels arranged in a retiform pattern and lined by hobnail-like prominent endothelial cells; Kaposi-like infantile haemangioendothelioma, a borderline malignant tumour of infants mimicking Kaposi's sarcoma histologically; epithelioid angiosarcoma, a highly aggressive tumour in the spectrum of epithelioid vascular lesions which stains positively for endothelial and epithelial immunohistological markers; benign lymph-angioendothelioma (progressive lymphangioma), a benign, slowly growing macule or plaque which has to be distinguished from well-differentiated angiosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma; and lymphangiomatosis of the limbs, a poorly recognised angiomatosis occurring in young patients and limited mainly to the limbs with a favourable prognosis.	2.817066969765638
Cardial features of the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) are congenital cataract, mental retardation, hypotonia and renal tubular dysfunction.	3.234700141189168
The primary biochemical defect remains unknown.	3.0578183130567176
An inborn error of the inositol phosphate metabolism as a result of mutations within the OCRL gene localized on the X-chromosome is discussed.	3.2689163310026967
Experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in man.	4.463035178179904
Ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable.	3.08542955254259
Because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory, such as microelectrode recording of transmembrane action potentials and high-density optical and electrical activation mapping, animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies.	3.841057241719788
Studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias.	4.101863410154156
The purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.	2.7019338812522844
Some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed.	3.5504562549029584
Because of the clinical importance of coronary artery disease this article concentrates on those arrhythmias caused by myocardial ischaemia and infarction.	3.8369590154631315
The authors report a rare, recently diagnosed and atypical mishap during one-lung ventilation (OLV) via a double lumen tube (DLT) and left-sided thoracotomy: an ipsilateral pneumothorax during ventilation of the right lung.	3.135490227900921
This occurred in a 63-year-old patient with chronic obstructive airway disease who was scheduled for urgent repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.	3.268045391074058
The common presentation of increased intrathoracic extrapleural pressure owing to a pneumothorax in patients with mechanically ventilated lungs is a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation, followed or paralleled by haemodynamic deterioration.	3.218175122907912
Although the above presentation could be seen in this case, the diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax was delayed twice.	4.556126890662285
First, symptoms were initially obscured by haemodynamic changes resulting from a head-down tilt and aortic declamping.	3.0791767304823314
In particular, since breathing sounds were detectable initially, malposition or torsion of the DLT had to be excluded by fibre-optic bronchoscopy, which involved a further delay.	3.076978321522477
Finally, two observations led to the diagnosis of a right-sided tension pneumothorax: (1) bullae of the contralateral lung, detected during thoracotomy; (2) the finding that ventilation of both lungs and the left lung subsequently increased arterial (SaO2) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and the circulatory status, but ventilation of the right lung caused a deterioration.	3.8256404389676284
Chest radiography and insertion of a chest tube with drainage of air, thereafter, validated our hypothesis.	3.034789735025232
The time course of oxygen desaturation during OLV and tension pneumothorax was as severe as expected; the time course of haemodynamic deterioration, however, appeared quicker and had more impact than expected.	3.5415198021359653
Assuming that mediastinal deviation was not hindered by contralateral intrathoracic pressure during thoracotomy, we believed that circulation should be depressed later or to a lesser extent in patients with an intraoperative pneumothorax.	3.399066287826032
Yet, during thoracotomy, decrease in cardiac filling and output during tension pneumothorax in OLV obviously results primarily from the immovability of the mediastinum owing to mediastinal fixation and is at least as decisive as the contralateral intrathoracic pressure in closed-chest patients.	3.0245058473825894
In summary, a tension pneumothorax during one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy is a rare, but disastrous complication during the use of a DLT, which has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously.	3.5328831515048087
We recommend that tension pneumothorax be added to the list of complications and problems during OLV by the use of a DLT, especially in patients with structural lung diseases.	3.7605564761996755
The intramedullary hip screw system Classic-Nail and the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) were evaluated in a prospective-randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.	3.3003465130414416
Hundred and ten geriatric patients (mean age 82 years) were runningly included in the study (56 Classic Nail, 54 DHS).	3.792358812061379
No significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow-up data.	4.259630141704139
With the Classic-Nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occured at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires.	2.9493790840361456
In the DHS group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively.	2.9267612702535786
At an avarage follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups.	3.4738786887609376
- Classic Nail and DHS both lead to equally good results in the operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.	2.9741714730237425
The internal fixation of fractures of shaft bones was spread out by a group of surgeons working together with Prevot.	3.6519508975443413
The principle of this method is a three point load carrying(entry point, height of fracture and cancellous bone of the metaphysis of the opposite fracture part).	3.3427664863088378
From 1996 to 1999 86 children with fractures of the humerus, the fore-arm and the femur were operated in the technique of intramedullary nailing.	3.460809079279802
The fractures affected the humerus to 3.5 %, the fore-arm to 65.1 % and the femoral shaft to 31.4 %.	2.9809442700015585
The postoperativ duration of stay in hospital after internal fixation of the fore-arm in the proximal and middle third lasted 7.2 days, the duration of immobilisation in a cast took 13.7 days.	3.552664708761343
96 % of the patients showed very good and good results after operation.	4.626702285138717
The average stay in hospital for patients with femoral shaft fractures was 14.4 days.	3.490964121694104
17 weeks after operation the intramedullary nails were removed.	3.690243993024291
At the time of first full weight bearing the legs showed an average shortening of 1.2 cm.	3.2308848644620007
The fractures of the humerus healed without any restriction of movements.	3.759476964883286
Internal fixation is a minimal invasive operation technique with low risks and small operating trauma.	3.5588513586094934
Due to the stability a early mobilisation is possible.	2.9719294078804612
The reported results in the literature are all good.	5.3146089961906195
The only problem can be caused by too long nails irritating the skin.	3.220388141335835

Physiology and age dependant changes of human bone marrow are described.	3.251720532993185
The resulting normal distribution patterns of active and inactive bone marrow including the various contrasts on different MR-sequences are discussed.	2.92919561067479
This report is based upon experience with 592 implantations of Swanson silastic spacer between 1978 and 1992.	2.7822946783329017
The results of 430 cases were followed up in 1995.	3.3346242616576234
Complications were observed in 31 cases and required further surgery.	3.6841402552262768
In 18 cases, the spacer was resected; in 2 cases a distal amputation was necessary.	3.6775980161189636
Due to pain, the spacer was changed in 11 cases, in 5 cases from a single-stem to a double-stem version.	4.361956014554545
Radiological reactions increase over time following the operation without correlation to pain.	3.3732366955372126
The results in cases of rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis disease are compared.	3.766364920902659
The results of the arthrosis group are slightly better.	2.8479395882136442
Introduction: The goal of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced T1-weighted Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences with conventional spin-echo sequences as a basis for planning high-precision radiotherapy.	2.814884100772527
Methods: A total of 25 consecutive patients with different intracranial tumors and a disrupted blood-brain barrier were studied.	3.7880487241450673
T1-weighted Flash, Turbo-Flash and conventional spin-echo images were evaluated after controlled 30-s infusion of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of Gd-DTPA.	3.081364478305872
Results: The signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) lower for Flash and Turbo-Flash than for conventional spin-echo sequences.	3.2243000452933135
Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences were more prone to susceptibility artifacts, conventional spin-echo sequences more to pulsation artifacts in the posterior fossa.	2.8262325860033406
Tumor sizes were comparable in all three techniques.	3.857887622026887
Conclusion: At present, conventional spin-echo images are superior to fast Flash and ultrafast Turbo-Flash sequences as a basis for accurate target volume definition in high-precision radiotherapy.	2.8107349957766083
However, fast Flash and Turbo-Flash images may be a practicable alternative to conventional spin-echo images for tumors in the posterior fossa or in patients unable to tolerate a stereotactic fixation device.	3.064885713141572
Despite some limitations, Turbo-Flash sequences enable fast dynamic MR imaging combined with an acceptable morphology, which may be sufficient for target volume planning in high-precision radiotherapy.	3.0734637029389185
Cystic tumors of the neck are usually cysts, inflamatory masses, lymph nodes, benign and malignant tumors or metastases.	4.2587794054533
Ectopic salivary tissue is a rather rare but clinically important malformation.	3.662516981062546
Accessory and aberrant tissue can be identified histologically.	3.708830440036259
There may be an association with lymphatic tissue.	3.779355166370408
Possible complications include inflammation as well as the development of benign and in rare cases malignant salivary gland tumors.	3.9260145572358716
Nucleotides are low molecular weight biological compounds that play major roles in almost all-biological processes.	3.1897078881844103
Cell nucleic acids and nucleotides are continuously synthesised, degraded and salvaged.	2.8449311673500213
The body's pools derive from three potential sources: synthesis de novo, salvage (recycling of preformed bases) and the diet.	2.9882603016705755
It is generally accepted that de novo synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines from amino acid precursors is capable of supporting the cellular needs for nucleic acid synthesis.	2.5292773205364827
When protein intake is decreased or in situations in which there are a high demand of nucleotides synthesis (after gut injury, after surgical trauma, sepsis, rapid growth: pregnancy or newborn infants, etc.)	3.303095541818439
some tissues with a rapid turnover (gut and immune system) may increase the salvage of exogenous nucleotides coming from the diet.	3.214901292383191
Therefore, nucleotides may become conditionally essential nutrients.	2.962545981093138
This article discusses the possible beneficial effects of dietary nucleotides on small intestine (maturation and recovery) and gut microflora, lipid and hepatic metabolism and on the immune system.	3.225196265324395
Human milk is the best source of nucleotides for young infants and the nucleotide/nucleoside profile of it shows a substantial predominance for pyrimidines as compared to purines.	3.411934290683992
Moreover, pyrimidine nucleotides seem to be better preserved in breast milk during storage in the breast and during digestion in the small intestine and they are more absorbed and incorporated into tissue RNA, as compared to purine ones.	3.3607888815473506
Additional research should be done to improve the design of nucleotides supplemented infant formulas.	4.008259661982597
This includes: 1) to investigate in vivo if the incorporation of dietary nucleotides in tissue RNA is enhanced in situations of stress or rapid growth and 2) to study the biological effects of individually administered purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.	3.383713167595724
Parkinson's disease (PD) causes significant expense for the national health care system due to its chronic progressive course, the duration of the disease, the high prevalence and the devastating prognosis.	4.113694636742749
In Germany more than DM 320 million are spent for drugs to alleviate parkinsonian symptoms.	2.7355157713325338
The aim of this study was to calculate the economic burden of PD by assessing direct medical costs.	2.5331312320779067
Forty patients suffering from idiopathic PD were interviewed at an office of neurological specialists and at an outpatient movement disorder clinic about their use of health care resources 3 months prior to the study.	3.586750434597468
The total annual costs reported were DM 14,500, consisting of DM 6500 for drug therapy and DM 8000 for other medical services, including hospital inpatient care (DM 5600), outpatient care (DM 700), medical sundries (DM 1100) and physiotherapy (DM 600).	2.858640282739523
The costs were positively correlated to the extent of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage; HY) and the occurrence of motor fluctuations/dyskinesias.We found that both drug-therapy expenses and total medical costs doubled from HYI to HYIV.	3.4371819742152128
The rarely employed s.c. therapy with apomorphine additionally increased the costs of drug therapy in HYV.	3.2203096124377533
The occurrence of fluctuations/ dyskinesias also increased medical expenses by approximately a factor of two.	2.4916053414057098
Indirect burden due to increased days off of work, unemployment and earlier retirement are also significant in Parkinson's disease.	3.0261628742740494
This study oncludes that a treatment which could prevent or retard disease progression as well as a treatment that delays or reduces motor complications would not only ameliorate the situation of patients suffering from PD, but would also lead to significant reductions in cost for the national health care system.	3.1934683223868725
The cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue is essentially intended to maintain fertility and endocrinological function in female cancer patients and female patients at increased risk of early menopause.	3.244665784771496
After having been frozen and subsequently thawed, the tissue can, ideally, be transplanted to its original site, where it leads to spontaneous fertilisation.	3.0310816609792943
Heterotopic transplantations are also discussed as autografts or xenotransplants in SCID mice.	3.227047741822387
Although considerable progress has already been made in both directions, these are still, at the present time, experimental processes that require further in-depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application.	3.2488035429936204
In addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, IVM of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction.	2.882175951457498
The successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation.	4.145561586094056
IVM is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of PCOS patients, for instance, increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by "rescuing" IVF cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes.	3.452226621822605
Background: Transconjunctival peribulbar anesthesia is reported to permit better identification of the bulbar limits because of a better view into the fornix; it is also said to be less painful compared to transcutaneous peribulbar anesthesia.	3.3546392275007113
The aim of our study was to compare the two injection techniques.	2.5176370752506494
The German Registry for Hearing Loss in Children (DZH) processes nationwide data from audiological centers.	2.6342270915436723
Coping with the accrued data and its subsequent management and analysis requires a high degree of security and control.	3.416924591134916
To establish a nationwide registry it is necessary at an early stage to take into consideration the legal requirements of the participating states.	3.556108911153207
Use of the DZH as an example demonstrates how a pragmatic solution can be reached.	3.267883445154986
Special issues concerning data collection, transfer, storage and deletion, coding strategies to ensure anonymity, checking for duplicate entries, data separation, and automated data analysis and data protection are explained.	2.806923007914952
Cardiac fibroblasts are known to have high affinity corticoid receptors for aldosterone and account for the accumulation of collagen within the interstitium of the rat myocardium in acquired and genetic hypertension.	3.136150349884816
This interstitial fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy in chronic heart failure.	3.5037756935306663
The social environment in which obstetrics is offered today is characterized by a mentality of weariness: weariness by affluence, ignorance and by misunderstanding.	2.9115516305250555
As a final result an unscientific era comes about, on which Karl Jaspers commented in 1945 that only this unscientific spirit had made National Socialism possible.	2.5730982470658454
Based on the good statistical results of German obstetrics compared to those of foreign countries, it is shown that our patients' demands for "gentle" obstetrics can be combined with the requirements of safe obstetrics.	3.58232345680269
If the professional interests of doctors and midwives are joint together, "safe and gentle" obstetrics should result in the common goal of a healthy child and a happy mother.	3.1856593847080625
Objectives: Due to its unique pharmacokinetics, the new esterase-metabolised opioid remifentanil results in rapid post-anaesthesia recovery.	2.8915705969461243
The aim of this clinical investigation was to compare recovery times after remifentanil anaesthesia in combination with hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or isoflurane.	3.2561209795361563
Dosages used in the study protocol were based on recommendations by the pharmaceutical manufacturer.	4.452633441744532
Methods: Patients (ASA status I-II) scheduled for elective arthroscopy were included in this trial.	2.916442333096577
Without premedication in the morning, anaesthesia was induced identically in both groups: remifentanil bolus (1 µg/kg), start of remifentanil-infusion (0.5 µg/kg/min), followed immediately by propofol (ca.	3.591349390211173
Anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously with termination of surgery and recovery times were recorded.	3.510149729845615
Results: A total of 40 patients were studied at random in two groups of 20 each with comparable demographic data and anaesthetic technique (Tables 1 and 2).	3.187904123541601
In both groups emergence was very rapid.	2.931381663575143
Recovery times were significantly shorter for remifentanil-isoflurane than for remifentanil-propofol (Table 3): spontaneous ventilation 5.1 vs 8.1 min (P<0.05), extubation 5.5 vs. 8.6 min (P<0.02), post-anaesthesia recovery score >=9 of 10 points 6.2 vs 11.3 min (P<0.01), and arrival at PACU 16.2 vs 19.2 min (P<0.01).	3.186072614003607
Mild to moderate shivering was noted in 40% of all patients (9 cases following isoflurane, 7 following propofol).	3.5986912311757067
Conclusions: Using the manufacturer's recommended dosages, emergence after remifentanil anaesthesia is more rapid with 0.5 MAC isoflurane than with 0.1 mg/kg/min propofol.	3.1069350609252746
These results are most probably due to the different pharmacological properties of both co-anaesthetics, especially the applied dosages, and to different interactions with remifentanil.	3.9147660324005864
Present clinical experience suggests that a further dose reduction, especially for propofol, is possible.	3.8092435734801224
For both remifentanil groups emergence was remarkably rapid between return of consciousness and the awake state (on-off phenomenon), which might contribute to post-anaesthesia safety.	3.370434474185891
Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma, with UVA possibly playing an important role.	4.7020836224433245
Hereditary factors are also relevant.	3.6246435964777053
In the dysplastic nevus syndrome a genetic instability has been shown by different methods.	3.5826038540683554
In xeroderma pigmentosum the DNA repair defect is thought to be responsible for the high incidence of malignant melanoma.	3.66936003367057
Frequent and non-random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells.	3.5650256661895874
These might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes.	2.928149166946681
Especially the short arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one of these genes.	3.720286393075096
This hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas.	3.5756847775857277
Changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma, but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known.	3.392738256161714
Neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood's epilepsy.	3.7512814769371476
Up to now it is not totally understood if focal EEG-pathology represents a specific cognitive deficit strongly related to the corresponding hemisphere's functions or represents a less lateralized but more general cognitive deficit of both cerebral hemispheres.	3.0039110608555752
In a sample of 44 pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing.	3.038169681639172
As a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing (more sequential than simultaneous) has been found.	3.2381038137101443
There was no correlation with the localization of an EEG-Focus nor with the hand preference.	3.135323715780737
According to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment.	3.4779193709702736
Our data indicate a possible affection of underlying metamemory functions.	2.7113720369226293
The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced shock strength in transvenous implantable defibrillator therapy.	3.145195095068067
So far clinical data concerning the safety margin of the shock energy in ICD therapy do not exist.	3.057524410330952
The shock energy tested during long-term follow-up in this study was twice the intraoperatively measured defibrillation threshold (DFT).	3.7654077885172588
A total number of 176 consecutive patients representing a typical cohort of ICD patients were evaluated.	3.254208567120041
All patients received a non-thoracotomy lead system (CPI, Endotak 0070, 0090) and a biphasic cardioverter-defibrillator with the ability to store episodes (Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., Ventac TM PRx II, PRx III).	3.0180719275510466
The intraoperative defibrillation threshold (DFT) was evaluated in a step-down protocol (15, 10, 8, 5 J) and hat to be <=15 J for inclusion into the study.	3.5896164026812536
The lowest effective energy terminating induced ventricular fibrillation had to be confirmed and was defined as DFT+ augmented defibrillation threshold.	3.849549739370399
The DFT+ value was tested immediately after successful implantation, at discharge, and after a follow-up period of one year.	3.811224771693113
Prior to implantation the patients were randomized into two groups.	3.7830736948970083
The energy of the first shock in the study group was programmed at twice DFT+ and in the control group at the maximum energy output (34 J).	4.260674806558227
The efficacy of the first shock and its reproducibility in DFT testings and in spontaneous episodes during long-term follow-up of the study group were compared to those in the control group.	3.877847061024218
A DFT+ value was found to be <=15 J in 166 of 176 patients (94%).	3.5629784986641995
The DFT+ in the study group was 9.6+/-3.2; in control group 10.1+/-.35 J.	3.205061656094287
The prohability of successful defibrillation at DFT+ level after one year was 84%.	3.1321290893090223
The success rate of the first shock meant to terminate induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 99.5% in the study group (217 of 218 episodes) and 99% in the control group (201 of 203 episodes).	3.3889071869301644
During follow-up of 24+/-9 months spontaneous episodes in the study group, 83/86 (96.5) monomorphic ventricular tachycardias (MVT) and 38/40 (95%) VF-episodes were converted successfully by the 2x DFT+ shock.	3.206837896373245
In the control group the first shock was successful in 151/156 (96.8%) spontaneous MVTs and in 30/33 (91%) VF episodes.	3.2528974353829945
The efficacy of the first shock was not influenced by clinical data such as the underlying cardiac disease, left ventricular function, ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone, or the number of spontaneous episodes per day or by the DFT itself.	4.0022937951080495
At a mean follow-up of two years there was no significant difference between the two groups concerning the incidence of sudden cardiac death (2.4% in the study group vs. 3.8% in the control group).	4.20967521830725
In conclusion programming the first shock with the ICD lead system used in this study at 2x DFT+ is as efficient as a shock energy of 34 J in order to terminate induced and spontaneous episodes of VT/VF.	3.633963705669674
Thus, the safety of ICD-therapy is not impaired when programming the shock energy at the 2x DFT+ value.	3.4183184226910117
Culpable deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete illegality of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage.	3.639050436833516
In cases of controversy it's the physician's due to prove the correct preoperative information.	2.9573500785927753
To reduce these liability-risks a computer based information system has been developed.	3.0370635549842397
With its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient.	2.962190074858773
Based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place.	3.0235327962635483
After the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information.	2.8706497674403333
The conception's use over many years shows that overlooking essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached.	3.658651025499304
In vitro culture of peritoneal explants of neonatal rats after previous application of agents simulating wound antisepsis is a sensitive screening method for the determination of the tissue compatibility of local wound antiinfectives.	3.373097693383739
Two test models are differentiated: (1) separated peritoneal explants as a model for chronic or deep wounds and (2) peritoneum in situ in the experimental animal with subsequent extraction and cultivation of the explants.	3.352828930027375
Considering the present state of knowledge the following conclusions can be drawn regarding antisepsis of wounds: Lavasept (0.1 %) may be classified as the agent of choice for deep and chronic wounds, for drip-suck irrigation and for antiinfective lavage of body cavities inclusively for peritoneal lavage (0,05 %).	3.176396273725311
Taurolidin is antiseptically effective in long term application ( > 6 h), and because of its antitoxic effect as well as lack of cytotoxicity it is especially suitable for peritoneal lavage.	4.170344339909482
Betaisodona solution is very well suited for superficial contaminated wounds and can be used in a dilution of 1 : 10 for short-term rinsing of deep wounds, including body cavities but not for peritoneal lavage.	3.7555804195493017
Ethanol causes no inhibition of explant growth and therefore retains its importance in wound antisepsis.	3.0672890372811685
Pain is a widely occurring disturbance of well-being and has serious consequences for the quality of life of patients suffering from acute or chronic pain.	4.202661026251604
Thus, pain makes high demands on the health system.	3.1555072489575284
For the first time in the Federal Republic of Germany the National Health Interview and Examination Survey allows to make representative statements concerning the prevalence of pain, its intensity, frequency, duration and localisation.	2.8836645667583993
Furthermore, the results enable to differentiate according to age, gender, and social classes.	3.208556643772432
The SF-36, used as an instrument to measure health related quality of life, has been employed to demonstrate the overwhelming significance of pain for the well-being of the population.	3.9573095133595784
In this publication the connection between certain disease syndromes like migraine and arthrosis and the prevalence of different qualities of pain is investigated.	3.1823290761082315
Additional more complex evaluation of the epidemiological data on pain are in preparation.	3.9281931260643175
In order to get an effective therapy of Tinea capitis drug must penetrate into the follicles.	2.6522373768135044
This can not be obtained exclusively by local treatment so that a combination with systemic therapy is necessary.	3.764035340080634
Griseofulvin is the drug of choice in childhood until now.	3.813890885252391
Death may occur while a fleeing or resisting suspect is taken into custody by the police.	2.885927942303566
We report about this type of acute death in two males.	3.313566191978247
In both cases, a cocaine intoxication was taken as the cause of death despite an initial suspicion of a direct association between the death and police measures (e.g.	3.2440606023389287
neck compression or "headlock", chest compression).	3.255210672060192
Of the 12 cases 5 were gunshot injuries and 4 were classified as suicide.	3.2260536621917923
The analysis suggested an increased willingness to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine.	3.143364676010884
In both cases, cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were unaware of any acute life-threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the suspects to flee or resist arrest.	3.085632883325139
Attention should be given to these types of cases during the training of police officers.	3.4287050720647705
Abstract  Hepatitis C antibodies have been detected in more then half of all autopsies of drug-related deaths in a 2-year period since November 1995 in Aachen, Germany.	3.727775082810384
It was of interest whether there is a risk of HCV transmission from the corpses.	3.868180853756814
The presence of HCV-RNA indicates infectiosity in the living but this may be different post-mortem.	3.1530254954565806
To our knowledge no case of HVC infection from a corpse has been reported so far.	3.114398136575806
Non-traumatic duodenocaval fistulae are rare, but may be the source of massive gastrointestional bleeding with associated fever and sepsis.	3.5833390947683528
These fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen.	3.085985094820101
The outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs.	3.371270027879389
The therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava.	2.8506548628493893
We describe the seventh case with radiogenic duodenal ulcer.	2.8320135240393842
Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred 10 years after radical nephrectomy and radiation (60 Gy).	3.4103933490483676
The patient survived following partial pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple).	2.6666778487687255
Purpose: Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) induces variable functional deficits depending on the grade of vascular occlusion and its localisation.	3.3125718919430414
Theses deficiences are not easily defined by visual acuity measurements.	3.3946799053512087
However, microperimetry offers topical mapping of retinal function, allowing precise documentation of the intensity and dimension of retinal functional loss in BRVO.	3.05868722039918
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is rare but beset with a high mortality rate.	3.363390901848614
In recent years, however, a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed.	3.07521113920991
High inspiratory oxygen concentrations, large tidal volumes, and high peak inspiratory airway pressures applied during mechanical ventilation have been identified as harmful to the lung and can contribute to the progression of ARDS.	3.4590646564840593
This had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy.	3.1331055951220743
Mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ARDS have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung, prevent oxygen toxicity, recruit the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space.	2.798840914976956
This new approach consists of various forms of pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation with PEEP and permissive hypercapnia, body position changes, and inhalation of nitric oxide.	3.1967823161349456
Should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option.	2.9370155968288083
None of these therapeutic procedures, however, has been tested against traditional standard treatment in a classical randomised controlled trial.	4.0600257681946355
The following review focuses on the latest insights into the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ARDS.	3.8754336249805275
Femoral neck fractures are frequent fractures of the elderly.	4.835451749618656
They can be treated by the use of dynamic hip screws, lag screws, bipolar hemiprotheses or total hip replacement.	3.612718537517975
The results are markedly influenced by the timing of the operation and the choice of the implant.	3.7034495238755487
Stool frequency after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is about 5/day after adaptation during the first year.	3.1608825678747743
It depends on stool volume and pouch capacity, not on the design of the pouch.	3.6630174241113025
In most cases evacuation is spontaneous and as complete as in healthy rectum.	2.877855663740392
67 % of patients are perfectly continent, while 19 % have to wear pads due to intermittent leakage.	3.067583661621641
Complete incontinence is reported in 0-4 % of the patients.	3.708157082368733
Preservation of the anal transitional zone by the double-stapling technique does not improve functional results when compared to endoanal mucosectomy or intersphincteric resection.	3.165089542392528
Impairment of continence is caused by damage of the internal sphincter with consecutive decrease of the pouch-anal pressure gradient.	4.484416217463422
Despite altered reflex activity, stool discrimination is preserved in most patients.	3.1084359993681887
The loss of colonic water and electrolyte absorption is compensated by decreased renal excretion.	3.1561204067983444
Alterations in bile acid metabolism are lower after IPAA than after ileostomy.	3.06774607689089
Bacterial overgrowth may lead to deterioration of the functional results.	4.537023219319962
Background: Methods from the area of virtual reality are used in oral and maxillofacial surgery for the planning and three-dimensional individual simulation of surgeries.	3.8526757837541536
Thirty-seven patients with chronic sinus pilonidalis were treated after total excision by Dufourmentel flap.	3.630666533617572
We saw seroma complications in three and wound infections in two cases.	3.2204212694476224
Patients stayed in hospital 6.3 days on an average and were able to work after 2.5 weeks.	3.808661471096177
We have not seen a return to sinus problems in any of this cases.	3.371906809085196
We describe a patient who was admitted to hospital because of hypoglycemic convulsions at the age of 6 months.	3.2917682686345877
Diagnostics revealed that the hypoglycemic episodes were caused by glycogen synthase deficiency.	3.565777625867343
Glycogen synthase deficiency its a rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia in childhood associated with normal production of ketone bodies.	2.9933434807967387
It is characterized by supranormal increase of glucose and lactate in blood after a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test.	2.8645463741433668
Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a reduced activity of glycogen synthase in liver tissue, and lately also by identification of pathogenic mutations in the glycogensynthase gene (GYS2-gene).	3.096142368593641
Hypoglycemic episodes can be prevented by offering frequent protein-rich meals during the day and a late evening meal with uncooked corn starch.	3.1372396239350584
Although most subacromial decompressions are performed arthroscopically, rotator cuff repair is still performed using an open or mini-open procedure.	3.0748908219250777
Arthroscopic techniques have improved in the last decade, however, so that rotator cuff repair can also be performed arthroscopically.	4.745455897608916
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a well-established method for the diagnosis of diseases of the heart and the great vessels.	4.334572037128127
Almost 20% of all patients cannot be completely examined by transthoracic echocardiography.	4.153251644314598
In this patient group, MRI can be used as a second line technique to provide important diagnostic information not obtainable by echocardiography.	3.6137019439483757
However, there are clinical problems for which MRI may be used as the first line technique such as complex congenital heart disease, diseases of the great vessels, pericardial disease or cardiac tumors.	3.958949860081607
MRI is undergoing rapid technical improvement and this will further improve the diagnostic utility of the technique, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.	3.524264554558766
In the last 7 years we have performed 220 infrainguinal vein bypasses associated with critical limb ischemia.	2.9085678706562623
All patients were prospectively controlled in a follow-up program 3 - 72 months postoperatively.	3.5984549513129163
The patients were divided into two groups: patients with diabetes mellitus (35%, group 1) and patients without diabetes mellitus (65%, group 2).	3.615111221613862
There was no difference in sex, age or localization of distal anastomosis (supra- or infragenicular) between the two groups.	2.744760243816944
The primary and the primary-assisted patency rates were not statistically different after 60 months.	3.200837951791425
There was a significant difference in limb salvage.	3.1336583410298724
The limb salvage of group 1 was 75% after 60 months, while the limb salvage of group 2 was 95% (P = 0.0045).	3.3132649239611807
The rate of major amputations was significantly higher in group 1 (15.6%) than in group 2 (4.9%, P = 0.007).	3.679995024660596
The indication for amputation was persistent foot infection.	2.782966636220008
A 24-year-old woman with lymph vessel dysplasia had experienced a progressive edema of her legs since her second year of life and progressive facial edema for the past year.	3.421322219999685
She also had telangiectasias and papules on the background of a diffuse erythema as well as marked seborrhea on her face.	3.6524568507637056
Histopathological examination of a representative facial lesion revealed a granulomatous dermatitis with periadnexal distribution mainly consisting of lymphocytes and histiocytes.	2.8461555524445723
In addition, there was a moderate fibrosis of the dermis with numerous mast cells.	3.0109708070723813
By duplex ultrasound, a diagnosis of a massive edema of the legs without evidence for chronic venous insufficiency was made.	4.389223489981972
The clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with solid persistent erythema and edema of the face associated with rosacea and lymph vessel dysplasia.	3.333051232849498
The chronic course, absence of serological abnormalities and nonspecific histopathological features as well as resistance to therapy are the most important diagnostic cirteria of this disease also known as Morbihan's disease.	4.196604896778667
The cervical spine is an extremely complex functional unit and has always been the subject of impassioned discussions among surgeons, orthopedic specialists and neurologists.	3.2934307680876094
In fact, in view of the clinical and technical neurophysiological options available to neurologists, it would be desirable for them to be involved as early as possible.	3.4907615876453586
In this paper the relative value of neurology, compared with orthopedics and surgery, in the diagnosis and treatment of whiplash injury to the cervical spine is discussed.	3.952820096119726
The newer options available - particularly in neurophysiology - are highlighted, as are the differential diagnosis and problems concerned with official expert assessments, which also involve other specialties.	3.119784660595961
A 19-year-old male patient with chronic cutaneous leishmaniosis was treated topically with paromomycin sulphate (15%) and methylbenzethonium chloride (12%) in petrolatum album.	3.045965678690495
After application twice daily for two periods of 32 and 44 days the lesions were completely healed.	3.165257458566342
Previous treatment for 9 months with ketoconazole (400 mg/day) together with the topical application of thiabendazole (2.5%) in base had been unsuccessful.	3.2455091651604886
No major side effects were observed after paromomycin sulphate application.	3.6600895021798197
Eight patients with spontaneous spinal epidural hemorrhages are presented.	3.1567485817706378
All eight initially had suffered from severe neck or back pain.	3.356588339742969
In seven cases, progressive neurological deficits had developed, some of which led to complete paraplegia.	3.3056042260001175
On all eight patients operations were performed.	3.5470031627435037
After an average of 11 weeks' follow-up, full recovery from the preoperative pain and neurological deficits could be seen in 6 of the patients.	3.9675401699301935
The confusion of scientific, economic, juridical and professional contexts is the reason for the present uneasiness within therapeutic culture.	3.2867666986527015
The author pleads for autonomy of these contexts to defend the profession reasonably against powerful overdetermination by other contexts.	2.6840799224546097
The debate about EST ("empirically supported therapy") is being drawn upon to show that the list of criteria for differentiation of effective and ineffective therapies is not warranted.	3.1807751547941385
Scientific or economic dominance claims might have deteriorating effects in the professional fields, as well-known researchers meanwhile fear.	3.9495468127637436
In economic contexts the aim is efficiency, in professional contexts it is quality.	3.1714886522316377
To develop own quality measures has the aim to promote the profession as a learning organization.	3.241366633889052
This could help to rise professionals' self-confidence.	2.946529357539563
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	2.124396490648786
In healthy humans procalcitonin levels are undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml).	2.8567216976879783
During severe generalized infections (bacterial, parasitic and fungal) with systemic manifestations, procalcitonin levels may rise up to 100 ng/ml.	3.302219287767717
In contrast, severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non-infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels.	3.300368364468832
The exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity.	3.106603216551192
In this retrospective study, oncologic and functional results of 24 patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages C and D are reported.	3.2879335377290717
The surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid-transcervical approach, which was modified according to individual tumor growth.	3.487612367754702
As needed, this was combined with a transtemporal or retrosigmoid approach.	3.6319475313129725
Complete tumor removal resulted in a cure rate of 100%.	3.4126418096308746
Surgically induced cranial nerve palsies developed in 38% of the patients.	3.483257136386134
In 54% of cases it was possible to retain middle ear function.	3.723010506846568
Seven patients had incomplete tumor removal requiring postoperative irradiation, with tumor progression occurring in 2 patients.	3.2024138320638604
Radical tumor removal was modified by efforts to reduce mutilating resections.	3.298932445645824
These results show that individually tailored and combined multidirectional surgical approaches can allow total tumor removal to be performed with lower morbidity.	3.3535909519275675
Electron beam CT, which does not require mechanical movement of an X-ray tube, has a temporal resolution which exceeds that of conventional computed tomography by a factor of about ten.	3.4974673249876083
ECG-triggered acquisition of 30 to 40 axial images (3 mm slice thickness) in a short inspiratory breathhold allows one to sample a 3-dimensional volume data set which covers the complete heart.	3.289963554370727
Overall acquisition times are approximately 30 to 50 seconds.	3.211966446397435
While electron beam CT in general permits a complete cardiac investigation, including morphology, function, and perfusion, the method's most important application is non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	3.3472161472834845
Without contrast enhancement, coronary calcification by EBCT currently constitutes the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence even of very early forms of coronary atherosclerosis.	3.4162395725166124
Intraveneous injection of contrast agent during image acquisition additionally permits the selective visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of significant stenoses.	3.3825549274320603
This method is especially well suited in the follow-up of coronary interventions and coronary bypass grafting.	3.5680650066384625
In spite of these limitations, electron beam CT has been shown to permit clinically valuable non-invasive investigations of the coronary arteries, which may be further refined as technology progresses.	3.862739551812105
Despite the availability of diagnostic modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging up to 30% of patients with acute aortic dissection remain undiagnosed before death.	4.016070983238478
A novel immunoassay of serum smooth muscle myosin as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of aortic dissection.	3.7162356923001654
The immunoassay was applied in two patients with an acute chest pain syndrome but no initial suspicion of aortic disease.	3.980178714176122
In both patients myocardial ischemia was ruled out by laboratory, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination.	2.9010632813555266
In the first patient both dilation of the aortas and long-standing arterial hypertension were known; however, it was not before 48h until dissection was suspected and a spiral-CT was performed demonstrating a localized ascending aortic dissection.	3.1570046900621773
In the other patient there was neither a suggestive history nor any clinical sign of aortic dissection.	2.9622854777682144
Widening of the abdominal was the key to the incidental diagnosis of a clinically unsuspected type B dissection.	4.0944862455794455
The serum test 12 h after onset of pain revealed elevated (diagnostic) serum levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chains.	3.128976509931945
Recurrent abdominal pain is found in 10-25% of school-aged children, thus being one of the most frequent complaints in childhood.	3.608195127976521
Following oral surgery, there are sometimes disturbances in wound healing.	3.9617478012669927
It was the aim of this investigation to look for relationships between the composition of saliva and disturbed wound healing.	3.0567556856261358
Resting as well as stimulated fasting whole saliva was collected from 96 patients (19 to 53 years of age) prior to oral surgery.	3.8552645518322857
The salivary data of eight patients who suffered from disturbed wound healing were compared to the data of 20 randomly selected patients with normal wound healing.	4.198797407037187
Patients with disturbed wound healing revealed increased activities and secretion rates for peroxidase in resting saliva.	2.8842705414172203
In stimulated saliva, decreased secretion rates for thiocyanate and total protein were found.	3.0404820000924113
A discriminant function including six salivary factors could be used to completely separate both groups.	3.4760460809374547
Nuclear imaging methods provide noninvasive indexes of myocardial function, perfusion, and metabolism and are well accepted in clinical cardiology.	3.3552626972360438
Advances in prevention and treatment of cardiac disease have resulted in decreasing cardiovascular mortality in industrialized nations.	3.59400445769462
The improvement in therapeutic options has increased the demand for diagnostic tests that might guide clinical decision making.	3.0634900960657485
Information beyond the pure anatomic characterization of coronary stenoses is required.	3.242758104442717
Nuclear imaging can be used for early detection and monitoring of the severity and extent of disease.	5.0603932453917375
The prognostic potential of such functional testing is being increasingly appreciated and used to guide therapy, thereby resulting in improvement of the quality and cost-effectiveness of the workup of patients with cardiovascular disease.	3.9987443377043705
Extensive clinical validation has resulted in growing acceptance of these techniques.	3.543400073549152
Furthermore, ongoing improvement of imaging techniques and development of new radiopharmaceuticals will pave the way for disease-specific, molecular-targeted cardiac imaging in the future.	3.5836890735444475
Epidural anaesthesia for elective caesarean section can have advantages over general anaesthesia.	3.352184649609894
The anaesthesiologist can avoid endotracheal intubation as well as fetal depression following placental transfer of systemic anaesthetics.	3.6184183374973693
However, despite reaching an effective blockade preoperatively, intraoperative discomfort and pain may occur during epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics alone, necessitating supplemental systemic analgesics or even conversion to general anaesthesia [21].	3.0987679825672982
Nevertheless, administration of epidural opioids before cord clamping is still hotly debated, some fearing maternal and or neonatal depression [6, 26].	2.838043510528153
The aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of analgesia, associated side effects and the resulting maternal and neonatal plasma opiate concentrations after a single preoperative addition of 0.1 mg fentanyl to epidural bupivacaine analgesia in comparison to epidural bupivacaine analgesia alone.	3.3017415877096896
The quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection.	3.0125564992977756
Even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible, the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a bread-loaf fashion subsequent to formalin-fixation and serial cross-sectioning of the coronary arteries, with decalcification in addition if necessary.	3.166772934152901
The distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis, the longitudinal, circumferential and transmural extent of infarction, its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by dissecting the heart chambers according to the flow of blood.	3.54096592702332
Cross-sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing, plaque hemorrhage, parietal and occluding thrombi and the effects and complications of angioplastic procedures or bypass surgery.	3.4217703049985446
Transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short-term territorial ischemia.	4.13447985641931
Total hip replacement is one of the most successful procedures in surgery.	3.18857035440781
In Germany there is a great variety of cemented and uncemented implants with different principles of fixation.	3.3326439942494686
We reviewed the different principles, with particular reference to long-term clinical outcome, and discuss the most popular systems available in Germany.	3.7722977688727837
Despite many new developments which have been made in the field of cementless hip replacement, cemented total hip arthroplasty will remain the "gold standard" until prospective long-term data (>15 years) of cementless systems become available.	3.9864447478369844
To summarize current knowledge on surgical therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis).	3.4612306113923417
Procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin.	3.4592234258922345
It is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection.	3.6602605977368246
In contrast, procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non-infectious systemic inflammatory states.	3.177089672653036
Because of these properties, procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis.	3.378906739157801
Increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity.	4.276221382998753
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	2.124396490648786
The origin of the high levels of procalcitonin in septic conditions is not fully understood.	3.665354186493582
Although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections, a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis.	3.4146020876640475
More studies are needed to uncover the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule.	3.5759187992917076
Fractures of the hand sceleton are common injuries.	3.470296122437334
These are or are associated with phalangeal fractures.	3.4889421888083696
Kirschner wires can be used for osteosynthesis, but can cause lesions of periphereal finger structures.	4.016407522115805
The aim of our study was to record the incidence of lesions in peripherial structures of the fingers caused by retrograde crossed inserted Kirschner wires of 1.0, 1.25, 1.4 and 1.6 mm diameter into the middle and proximal phalanges of the long fingers and the proximal phalanx of the thumb of 120 fresh cadaver hands.	3.3027509805363837
We found an increase of insertion attempt frequency and an increasing number of lesions with increasing Kirschner wire diameter.	3.7587067049406575
Because of these findings Kirschner wires of 1.0 or 1.25 mm diameter should be prefered to prevent the periphereal functional finger structures.	2.755470131208923
Fucosidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease due to nearly complete deficiency of -L- fucosidase, was diagnosed in two unrelated male German patients who exhibited typical symptoms of this disorder including mental retardation, dysostosis multiplex, vacuolization of lymphocytes and progressive neurologic deterioration by the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively.	3.264899080159534
In both cases, activity of -L-fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible.	2.564760430907194
DNA analysis revealed a nonsense mutation (G401X) in exon 7 of the fucosidase gene; this leads to a premature stop codon and C-terminal deletion of 61 amino acids from the protein.	3.18365702856088
Discussion: On account of the mutation a unique PFlMI restriction site is obliterated; this simplifies molecular diagnosis of the G401X mutation.	3.1582642534963132
So far, the mutation G401X has not been found in any other population.	3.466125234028086
The main reason for posttraumatic secondary brain damage is cerebral hypoxia.	3.0658534144615186
Both, severity and duration of hypoxia are crucial in determining wether irreversible cerebral infarction will occur or not.	3.2057248481074603
For the clinical routine, the diagnosis of hypoxia is indirectly made by low CPP, low jugularvenous oxygen saturation (SjO2) or low tissue PO2.	3.4212329683837517
To minimize misleading false negative SjO2, the CT-Approach for the side of monitorig and calculation of arterial-jugularvenous lactate content for detection of anaerobic metabolism is recommended.	3.1141694472465824
Targeted treatment of hypoxia according to the underlying cause is mandatory.	3.7504356574443567
Primary goal is to increase cellular oxygen delivery by correction of low arterial oxygen content and elevation of regional CBF.	3.4344763517317403
Within the autoregulatory range decreasing CPP causes vasodilation and increasing CPP vasoconstriction with increasing or decreasing cerebral blood volume respectively.	2.8469298921359574
Initially elevation of the lower autoregulatory threshold often requires CPP 70 mmHg.	3.8564496526005523
Targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension must avoid decreasing CPP.	3.0723127116025575
In the early postrautmatic phase prevention of cerebral hypoxia relies on management of CBF by means of CPP and cerebral vascular resistance.	3.1492806647612466
Thereafter targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension caused by cerebral edema and hypervolemia are increasingly important.	3.0616543614279865
Today, orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end-stage of various liver diseases, and a 1-year survival rate of 80 % and a 5-year survival rate of 70 % in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys.	4.146334118091147
The liver transplant programme of the Inselspital in Bern is small compared with international centres, which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme.	3.440486177517165
Over a period of 66 months, 62 liver transplantations were performed in 60 patients at the Inselspital.	3.3952283894271313
The hospital mortality was 3.3 %, and the 2.5-year overall survival rate was 92 % for elective cases without tumor.	3.6391751280749
After a median follow-up of 30 months, 68 % of all patients were re-integrated in housework or full- or part-time in their profession, and 83 % were independent from the help of others.	3.490266971665887
We conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards.	3.0454755836614726
Accidental hypothermia (AH) can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below 35  °C during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic thermoregulatory dysfunction.	2.891838668308386
Pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co-morbid factors such as trauma, submersion, intoxication and underlying diseases.	3.39267510056618
In trauma victims stratified according to the Injury Severity Score, the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival.	3.539421059327562
In these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible.	3.223932175964683
In the Utrecht University Hospital, adult patients with AH are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions.	3.0377949690897483
Patients with perfusing cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over 80 mmHg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR).	2.6684558067433084
Arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	3.000325813417269
In a 3-year period, 22 patients with AH were admitted to the emergency department.	3.82944016775386
Fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia.	4.638412227717651
Twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm (CAVR n = 18, CPB n = 2) and two patients were alternatively managed.	4.187296591615671
Mortality in the CAVR group was 28 % and total mortality reached 32 %.	3.181364678641613
Complications of CAVR are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation.	3.872660947446222
CAVR permits a good access to the (trauma-) patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries.	3.599772959478927
The grading of long-tubular-bone pseudarthrosis depends on the biological reaction or lack of reaction in pseudarthrosis or non-unions.	3.9512180539665867
Hypertrophic and oligotrophic pseudarthrosis belongs to biologically reacting non-unions, whereas non-reacting non-unions are necrotic pseudarthrosis and defective non-unions with partial decline or complete destruction of cortical substance.	2.797906361254669
Pseudarthrosis is a serious disturbance or disorder within the regulation cycle in fracture healing, which consists of osteoregeneration, osteovascularization and stabilization.	3.1123365038098165
The causes and underlying reasons for disturbance of this regulation cycle are primarily massive destruction of the biological and functional very important unity of periost, cortical substance and medullary space.	3.1279537674512707
This can occur from trauma, but it happens more often from surgical procedures that do not take the biological principles of bone-healing into account.	3.684343664126693
Surgical strategies and interventions that respect the importance of periosteal tissue, cortical tissue and medullary space do fill the biological principles of fracture-healing and fracture union.	3.3353921412928362
Background: Clonidine, an 2-receptor agonist, has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics.	4.057711396093031
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of spinally injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics.	3.116669009494506
Differentiation of an elevated, repeatedly determined platelet count (>=500x109/l) includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic myeloprolifera-tive disorder (CMPD).	3.1272882343546504
In addition to clinical findings, the evolution of laboratory data during follow-up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact.	3.7635644531481955
Characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis, but also by the myeloid stromal compartment.	4.019760798351687
While the megakaryocyte-rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the 5q- syndrome (MDS) are dominated by abnormal micromegakaryocytes, in polycythemia vera (PV) this cell lineage reveals a pleomorphous appearance.	2.8857517983640375
A clear-cut discrimination of ET from early (hypercellular) stages of idiopathic (primary) myelofibrosis (IMF) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible, provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis characterizing the latter entity are taken into account.	2.66333882412194
Moreover, CML displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas PV shows a panmyelosis or trilineage proliferation, involving erythropoiesis, in particular.	2.919417272302832
In contrast, erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in CML and to a lesser degree also in IMF.	3.0539062390243785
In CMPDs extreme values of iron deposits may be found, ranging from a total lack (PV) to minor amounts (CML) and a normal staining reaction (ET).	3.5060257588520063
Similar results are exhibited regarding reticulin fibrosis, which is usually not present in ET, rarely observed in PV and detectable to a variable degree in CML and IMF.	3.3635211718412994
Nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes are uncommon.	3.536275296768325
This benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia.	3.393992883224358
We report the case of a 56-year-old patient who underwent breast biopsy, followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy.	3.267311302908439
Histological examination revealed solid cell aggregates as foreign tissue in the capsule of 1 of 11 identified lymph nodes devoid of any keratin immunoreaction.	2.8660899961163118
Strong immunohistological staining for the S-100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates.	3.908627801202236
We report the case of a seven year old girl presenting with varicella infection 14 days after kidney transplantation.	2.8465198848403714
Cramp-like abdominal pain and a subileus were the first symptoms.	4.087786149267613
Enemas did not relieve the symptoms, and the following laparotomoy with Tenckhoff catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities.	3.596556967464282
Two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed.	4.028341934348847
Further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella-zoster virus was isolated from their fluid.	2.8838936503399157
Despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella-zoster immune globulin further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy.	2.6738001212188354
The patient died 18 days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure.	2.8467934242650754
The unconscious patient presents an challenging emergency in the intensive care unit.	2.844034075973474
Patient evaluation and treatment must occur simultaneously.	3.4148722363150017
After checking vital signs, deciding about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation, an intravenous line must be established, blood samples collected and glucose and thiamine should be given.	3.0792426978273206
The physical and neurological examination should be performed in a efficient way and must consider the following eight points: best reaction to loud commands, best motor reaction to noxious stimuli, respiratory pattern, size and reactions of pupils, eye movements, corneal and blink reflex, meningismus, muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes.	3.0431482307334643
With this approach it is possible to formulate a working diagnosis, and the appropriate diagnostic steps can be performed.	4.066214010262397
A severe course of alcohol withdrawal has been observed in 28% of patients in a neurological intensive care unit due to complicating central nerve system (CNS) diseases.	3.8987569299231577
In any atypical alcoholic delirium, especially with focal neurological signs, partial seizures, or decreased level of consciousness, CNS diseases like meningoencephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, or central pontine myelinolysis must be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tap.	3.1022567331518562
The diagnostic and prognostic value of CT scan and CSF analysis was examined in 32 persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens.	3.3966198583032283
Neurological complications and cerebral convulsions at the beginning of delirium tremens appear to predispose the patient to a protracted clinical course and necessary mechanical ventilation.	3.579426281135011
Blood-CSF barrier permeability is increased in 70% of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course.	3.7232437897023303
Cerebral atrophy as shown in CT scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course.	3.242049609237925
In our experience, CT examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium.	3.0518653446520356
Recently, an implantable hearing aid for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss has been developed.	3.09358300381669
One component of the device is the microphone for implantation into the posterior canal wall.	3.6627537973272277
The membrane of the microphone can be covered by skin, cartilage, or fascia, avoiding reduction in sound transmission at the same time.	3.052932113189042
In the study presented here, the microphone was implanted into 50 cadaver specimens of human temporal bone.	3.0549477082806433
Localization of the microphone was determined by the anatomical situation of the facial nerve.	4.484870908636003
The microphone and the piezoelectric transducer could be implanted in 78% of the temporal bones after total mastoidectomy.	3.3556946422669203
In the final version of the microphone, the size was 4.5 mm and total weight 400 mg.	3.338672354636405
Collagen vascular diseases, representing systemic soft tissue disorders, may cause a broad spectrum of pathologic changes of the respiratory tract.	3.839789875161637
The type and extent of manifestations can vary considerably among individuals and entities.	3.18606474158122
This survey describes the chest radiographic and, in particular, high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) findings of individual lesions of the respiratory tract.	3.8672376504129202
It includes fibrosing alveolitis (alveolitis, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis) and bronchial (bronchitis/bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis), pleural and vascular manifestations, as well as lymphadenopathy and abnormalities related to therapy.	2.9429354694172085
We present typical patterns of changes in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, Sharp syndrome), Sjögren syndrome, overlap syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	2.7657311637092947
Furthermore, we describe findings which are specific for individual entities such as esophageal involvement in PSS, acute pneumonitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in SLE, lymphoproliferative disease in Sjögren syndrome and necrobiotic nodules in RA.	2.7945225848811135
The psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders, or "hysterical" symptoms are increasingly understood as ways of coping with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence such as abuse or violence.	3.2727598720990794
Dissociation with induced depersonalisation, derealisation, and personification of objects as only good or only bad is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.	3.185784266222911
Unassimilated memories of traumata have a retraumatizing effect and call for defence through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behaviour, or social acting-out.	3.0073319608807574
Against this psychodynamic background we describe a method of trauma-therapy which uses experiences of hypnotherapy and of Guided affective Imagery.	3.2137154782148984
In the preparatory phase a secure inner space and contact to inner helpers are established in the imagination using a resource-oriented approach.	3.0259104167053787
The actual trauma-therapy consists of a gradual leading-up to the traumatic scenes through consistent, minimally retraumatizing confrontation, followed by consolation and the ability to let go.	3.760006383373707
In the final phase there is a return to resource-oriented creativity and concrete life planning.	3.1900982506987416
All patients of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Erfurt Hospital with odontogenic pyogenic infections have been analyzed in a retrospective study over a period of 10 years, from 1987 to 1997.	3.2479899916524393
This included questions concerning frequency, seriousness and treatment of these infections, social changes in the environ prove effects about the referral behaviour and the course.	3.874516623064672
Odontogenic pyogenic infections are mixed infections.	3.3358432414580292
Aerobic agents such as hemolytic streptococcuses and staphylococcuses as well as anaerobic bacteria and  fungi can be involved.	3.3788690654210436
Cephalosporine, aminobenzylpenicillin in combination with -lactamase inhibitor, alcylaminopenicillin and lincosamide are recommended based on analysis of infection resistance as first choice medications with carbapeneme as a reserve antibiotic.	3.022380340478447
Hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector.	3.168459316726977
Comparison of hospitals is legally required (BPflV § 5) to improve financial efficiency in the health care sector and make competition between hospitals keener, while also objectivizing it.	2.976602017584352
If comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance profitability or efficiency, and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality, it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation summarizing performance and calculation and the hospital statistics (no.	3.299725514135659
of cases, days of care, length of stay, case lump sums and special fees).	3.835643618531175
Documentation of particular features of the patient population, the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level.	4.533380261212126
With rising costs, the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service.	3.6079565692807534
Hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital's own situation with regard to performance, quality, efficiency and patient satisfaction, but can also provide a basis for structural planning.	3.716197434104143
The fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures, processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients, the doctors who refer them and the visitors.	3.742642845551156
If hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the invoicing data, it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level.	3.2201040965910392
This would be bad for the patient and, in view of the consequent costs, also for the overall costs in the health care sector.	4.012708671156794
Against the backdrop of a future performance-related system of remuneration instead of the principle of covering one's own costs that has been in place hitherto, openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals.	2.918891438098286
Laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 120 patients scheduled to undergo either radical perineal prostatectomy or radiation therapy.	3.833300649103891
On average 13 lymph nodes were resected in each patient, and 21 patients were found to have metastatic disease in 1-9 lymph nodes.	3.7343197426846837
After an initial learning curve, mean operative time was reduced significantly, allowing laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical prostatectomy to be performed as a one-stage procedure.	3.6448748245436255
The overall complication rate was 10 %; open revisions were necessary in only 2 of 120 patients.	3.48078834165233
Postoperative hospital stay was 2 days in patients undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection only.	3.923312753441248
This minimally invasive procedure is particularly beneficial to patients with lymph node metastases not undergoing radical prostatectomy, as well as to patients planned to be treated by radiation therapy.	4.246435436081899
The combination of laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical perineal prostatectomy avoids an abdominal incision and thus shortens both the hospital stay and the period of convalescence.	3.2811456481305212
Taking the concepts of psychic structure and internal representation as an example, three different ways of relating psychoanalytic concepts to neurobiology are presented and discussed: the localizing, the metaphorical and the modelling relation.	3.272962165454055
The need is stressed not to mix up the different levels of description and explanation too early; at the same time it is argued that - after the dismissal of the old metapsychology - this way of relating offers a new chance to integrate neurobiological aspects in the concept of psychic structure without falling into the traps of biologistic reductionism and individualism.	2.965645553256812
Following augmentation of the upper extremity muscles necessitated by damage to the brachial plexus, special post-operative care programs are required to provide the patient with the best possible results.	4.314233178561019
Proper care requires cooperation between the orthopedic surgeon, physical therapists and nurses.	3.290613776790742
Only then can postoperative rehabilitation and functional control of the extremity improve.	3.7000035171846966
We describe interdisciplinary postoperative care programs for augmentation of the deltoid muscle with trapezius transfer, arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint, biceps augmentation with the latissimus dorsi transfer, Steindler flexorplasty and augmentation of flexors/extensors muscles in the hand.	2.777844182161617
The prevalence of type I allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire, prick tests and the determination of specific IgE antibodies.	3.3820453968903887
Positive prick tests against different latex fluids were found in 18 (8.7%) of 206 students, with clinical relevance in 11 cases.	3.452070994118598
When the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2% in the second semester to 10.4% in the tenth semester was seen.	3.5203870038023877
A history of glove intolerance presenting as a wheal-and-flare reaction was associated with a type I allergy against latex in only 50% of the affected subjects.	3.6273874761761093
Atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in 16 and 5 of 18 students with latex allergy, respectively.	3.541183942352628
A high-ammonia accelerator-free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific IgE antibodies to latex.	3.3256403975355493
In addition to tumor relapse, the development of a second tumor or intraperitoneal tumor spreading, and benign alterations in advanced tumor stages (radiogenic stenosis, adhesions) may also be the cause for the obstruction.	3.536152345667521
The main objective of therapy is an attempt to eliminate the intestinal obstruction through surgery.	3.7580138629804125
If this is not possible because of advanced intra-abdominal tumor expansion, several endoscopic or interventional radiology methods, and drugs are available, that are used on an individual basis and based on prevailing experience to relieve the patient's condition.	3.359052055203618
The case of a 60-year-old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma (T3N2CM0) and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented.	3.2973276999110754
On one side, the sacculus opened atypically into the left vestibular fold.	2.9339940340000465
The sacculus is a physiologic part of the roof of Morgagni's ventricle, the size of which can vary greatly.	3.956841757518071
These canal-like structures can be the point of origin of cysts, laryngoceles, mucoceles, and pyoceles.	3.1342489762251446
Adverse effects of resuscitation due to closed-chest cardiac massage are common, and the incidence is increased when an incorrect technique is used.	3.672911342386666
Nevertheless, thrombolytic therapy of a myocardial infarction can become necessary even after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).	3.19324361883077
In these patients, the risk of thrombolytic therapy-induced bleeding is immanent.	4.913550712056727
Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD) have led to a reduction in cardiac mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	4.866187262355954
A considerable number of patients experience repeated shocks which may have an impact on the quality of life.	3.279519593270734
An overview of the 30 years history and developement of documentation and information systems in the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is presented.	2.950784632186051
Since the foundation in 1967 four developmental phases can be described: first initiatives of medical doctors, establishment of a basic documentation system for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning and realisation of information systems with the possibility of controlling in medical areas and thereby steering of the services.	3.183746978402757
Planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the masterplans and concepts of the university clinics of the state of Baden-Württemberg.	3.2712399941819412
The treatment success of nCPAP therapy (nasal continuous positive airway pressure) depends partly on the relief of symptoms and partly on long-term patient acceptance and the related avoidance of complications.Nasal complaints constitute the most frequently reported side effects and, together with problems of mask application, are among the primary factors causing an nCPAP-therapy to be prematurely discontinued.	3.521349720929927
The foramen ovale is anatomically open in 25 % of individuals, but functionally closed by the higher pressure in the left antrum.	3.3973070704731243
Right-to-left shunt and subsequent paradoxical embolism may occur when pressure in the left antrum rises, for example, as a result of pulmonary embolism.	3.965684945318039
In the present case we demonstrate a patient who presented 20 days after osteosynthetic treatment of a femoral fracture with word-finding deficits.	3.3116399242877286
Cerebral MRT revealed a fresh ischemic insult.	3.438443505834293
Duplex ultrasound of the legs showed a fresh thrombosis of the superficial femoral vein and scintigraphy of the lungs detected pulmonary embolism.	3.7782310037284774
Transesophageal contrast echocardiography trapped a hemodynamically spontaneous, open foramen ovale.	2.9011838028246233
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can be clinically unconspicuous and become manifest by cerebral deficits resulting from paradox embolism and cerebral ischemia.	2.9611278978897286
The diagnostic strategies in multiple trauma aim at rapid identification of life-threatening injuries, recognition of serious organ lesions, and evaluation of the systemic trauma impact, as well as the resulting host reaction.	3.5540306044511363
Besides improvements in the structure and organization, major innovations in imaging techniques have significantly improved and accelerated evaluation of the patient with multiple injuries in the emergency room.	4.530139187541496
Systematic diagnostic work-up, integrated multidisciplinary approach, and defined algorithms for traumatic key symptoms represent the hallmarks of successful emergency room management.	3.3875222429194816
In particular, diagnostic work-up of injured body cavities using sonography and helical computed tomography are evaluated.	3.1041829093051927
Pheochromocytomas are functionally active, catecholamine-secreting tumours of chromaffin tissue.	3.0949625472779867
The mainstay of pharmacological therapy is preoperative treatment with oral phenoxybenzamine.	3.102728553183223
This drug irreversibly alkylates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them nonfunctional, thereby causing vasodilatation.	2.891177361297723
The duration of action of a single dose is approximately 24 h. Therefore, postoperative hypotension is a hazard of therapy with phenoxybenzamine if adequate plasma volume repletion is not provided.	3.294701208421488
Prazosin, a short-acting, competitive alpha-1 blocker, has been used preoperatively, but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes.	4.147607968585515
Case report: Case presentation of a 59-year old female patient, who has been treated for her cancer by a physician of internal medicine with peroxodisulphuric acid.	3.4130173177225576
For this therapy to be successful - according to the physician - all drugs especially the analgetics had to be stopped.	4.207613444879479
We present a case of primary plasmocytoma of the left upper bronchus.	3.2838391051772353
Occlusion led to atelectasis of the left upper lobe and subsequent poststenotic pneumonia.	3.6528572714109995
Therapy consisted of local excision of the bronchus and postoperative radiotherapy.	3.807195599047436
This type of lung-conserving therapy in a case of primary plasmocytoma has not been described before.	3.7722629363777767
545 male patients with a tentative diagnosis "urethritis" were examined between November 1984 and December 1994 in the Department of Dermatology and Venerology of the Military Hospital in Ulm.	3.4320419994516347
The patients, aged from 18 to 58 years (mean age 24.1 years), were examined according to a standardized diagnostic procedure: ...	4.0854952513380685
The use of the Kaufman-Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) was evaluated with a sample of 50 mentally disabled adults in a wide age range, as there exist no special tests for this group of patients.	3.3617637428843845
Intercorrelation- and factor analyses, and correlations with the German adaptation of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (HAWIE-R) proved the use of the K-ABC to be valid.	3.5719502430177603
As an assessment battery for children designed for the wide age range from 2-6 to 12-5 years is more adequate to the capability of intellectually impaired adults, the K-ABC delivers results on individual strengths and weaknesses, based on a neuropsychological theory.	3.2134657393883037
Thus the individual cognitive abilities can be assessed with more differentiation, and that gives an important base for intervention, partial remediation, and placement.	3.217634090927321
Subject: Using multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) large body areas can scanned with high spatial resolution.	2.9729881509090537
In this study, MSCT was employed for virtual colonoscopy in various pathologies of the colon.	2.848353220475432
Screening led to 317 biopsies with a positive predictive value of 0.33.	3.457559365900049
All biopsy documentation available to the mammography physicians was analysed with a view towards biopsy interval and completeness of information fed back to the Mx physicians.	3.1159811380272893
Biopsy recommendations were acted upon in 29 % of cases within 2 weeks.	3.0899458603084544
With the exception of the dignity Mx physicians were incompletely informed about biopsy results.	2.5964944714494833
The surgical procedure was known in the doctors' offices in 62 % of the cases.	3.1990187162343515
Specimen radiographies were not done regularly.	3.5258545754101527
A pathology report was available overall in 42 of 106 malignant cases, respectively.	2.97208502795576
Only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely.	3.728539882377872
Fail-safe information are requested by Mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations.	3.0926611351286817
A (regional) quality assurance center should be made responsible to analyse the flow of information in mammography screening, to fill in gaps and to speed up professional cooperation.	3.283246261415111
The high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment.	3.7611140934390783
In a 13-year period, 52 out of 95 patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively.	3.4084610420699955
The was being left in situ on an average of 6.6 days.	3.7315800649849753
After an observation period of at least 36 months a recurrence was seen in 2 of these 52 patients (3.9 %; causes: volvulus after 6 months/fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day).	3.4156280111973847
In the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted.	3.5023945785851325
Complications concerning the nasointestinal tubes did not occur.	2.9533098879521167
The rate of perioperative complications was similar in both groups.	3.0828366108297627
Minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been developed to offer patients the benefits of open heart operations with decreased pain and limited skin incision.	3.6653649299822204
In this study, we report the results of minimally AVR compared to the conventional method performed in the same period.	4.58220724322778
From May 1996 to January 1998, 86 patients received isolated aortic valve replacement by the limited superior median sternotomy (group 1).	3.4011540710577393
As a control group (group 2), 78 patients were enrolled who underwent isolated aortic valve replacements by standard sternotomy in the same period.	3.736591010887805
However, their importance throughout low-levels of exercise is poorly evaluated.	3.0442658168763863
Each patient was tested in VVIR-, DDD-, and DDDR-mode.	3.5030384198679223
All AV delays were constant at 160ms.	3.101310160125877
The oxygen deficit (O2D), mean response time (MRT) for oxygen uptake, and a oxygen deficit index (O2Di) were determined.	3.6192491987714024
In addition, the heart rate (HR) and bloodpressure were monitored.	2.7491159263034533
Results: Significant differences (p<0.01) were observed in HR and O2D when comparing both DDD- to VVIR- and DDD- to DDDR-modes.	3.4353031735337103
Comparing the randomly synchronous VVIR- to the DDDR-mode, only the MRT of oxygen uptake demonstrated a significant decrease in the DDDR-mode (p<0.05).	3.110376187248364
There were also significant decreases in O2Di and MRT in the DDDR-mode, as compared to the non-rate responsive DDD-mode (p<0.01).	3.293346638055464
Stress testing in PM patients with an appropriate chronotropic response to low intensity exercise demontrates that AV synchrony is of much less influence on oxygen uptake kinetics than the rate-adaptive pacing.	3.0518514927669274
Purpose: This paper discusses the role of different imaging modalities in the diagnostic work-up of Crohn's disease (CD).	4.041388489345566
Introduction: Results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non-cemented prostheses can, at the very least temporarily, be impaired by the application of non-steroidal antiphlogistic agents (such as diclofenac).	3.965978168437913
It is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages (3 times 50 mg daily) on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses.	3.5723133544453236
Methods: To investigate this, cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications.	3.1277560225794168
Our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines.	3.291714121910869
The measurable maximal plasma concentration 2h after the application of one tablet Voltaren 50 reached 1.6µg/ml.	3.1719571192041
This correlated with diclofenac concentrations between 1 and 10 ml found in our experiments.	3.1747600855971214
The detected values were correlated to the control group (0 µg/ml diclofenac).	3.749761123453668
Results: The drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells.	3.0325637122966023
The proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells, compared to untreated cells, was found to be decreased.	3.711132746568097
We observed a decrease to 82% at a diclofenac concentration of 1 µg/ml, Osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to 97,5% at the same concentration.	3.5503464698390346
The DNA synthesis increased to 118% in stromal bone marrow cells, in osteoblasts to 144%.	2.7519828290682837
In contrast, we detected a neglectible decrease to 92% in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells.	2.8779748955064868
The synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to 119%.	2.8237935834086105
The alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to 88% in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to 111%.	3.21060727993379
Conclusion: Temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non-cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism, exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression.	3.671346974888866
Osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the osteoneogenesis is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition.	3.229942639276956
Recent investigations have controversially but convincingly interpreted the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis).	3.116351311986534
Atherosclerosis can apparently be the result of ultrachronic, persistent infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae and not the result of heterogenous risk factors.	3.6211283974855033
The main arguments for chlamydial genesis are: Correlation of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic diseases and antibodies against Chlamydia pneumoniae.	3.0128976081009315
(2) Chlamydia pneumoniae could be detected with different techniques (PCR, ICC, immunhistology, electromicroscopy, culture) in a high percentage of atheromas from different sites.	3.3956588131392604
(3) According to three successful international studies with macrolides in coronary heart disease.	2.9051406732522005
(4) Target cells of atherosclerosis (endothelia, macrophages, muscle cells) can be infected by Chlamydia pneumoniae in vitro.	3.490850403854237
(5) Provocation of arteriitis in animal experiments.	3.39241063376168
(6) The reduction of incidence of atherosclerotic diseases since the 1960s, probably due to advances in antibiotic treatment.	3.496391760444995
(7) Elevated levels of acute-phase proteins and other inflammatory signs (CRP, WBC count, fibrinogin) briefly before cardiac infarction occurs.	3.1624893445015623
There are good arguments for intervention studies in coronary heart disease and other manifestations of atherosclerosis.	3.2282818758589076
The relevant antibiotics are available for chlamydial infections and are inexpensive and safe.	3.4921313180082634
Therapy of isolated zygomatic bone fractures consisted in repositioning with a hook and miniplate fixation across the frontozygomatic suture.	2.742306753657361
A total of 52 patients were examined.	3.584173550888473
After the operation (on average after 3.5 days following the trauma) they were followed-up postoperatively for 12 months according to a strict schedule.	3.4277752469178155
Preoperatively, 49 patients reported disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	3.4167864631517513
Other symptoms, such as periorbital haematoma and flattening of the zygomatic prominence, were observed in 49 patients and 45 patients, respectively.	3.8870564713382305
All fractures were repositioned well as assessed clinically and radiologically.	3.101126864097084
The aesthetic result was evaluated as symmetric and durable in all cases.	3.281589672201523
In only five patients (10.2%) was the sensitivity loss persistent throughout the entire follow-up period.	3.1004416600173634
Patients with primarily lacking diplopia developed neither eye motility disturbances nor postoperative enophthalmus in the following period.	2.9596730623341574
It can be concluded that the treatment of an isolated zygomatic bone fracture which satisfies aesthetic and functional requirements is possible by reposition and fixation with one miniplate at the lateral orbital rim.	3.4244150924622594
An additional osteosynthesis at the infraorbital rim or at the zygomaticomaxillary crista is not necessary.	2.993763961927029
A routine revision of the orbital floor is only indicated in cases of preoperative diplopia.	4.040579374650771
A zygomatic bone fracture connected with diplopia should be classified as combined zygomatic-/orbital floor fracture.	3.121383071697214
Chronic primary headache has a considerable impact on the quality of life.	3.3156018929134867
To date, this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life.	3.295023713253813
Headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the German language.	4.726568900499486
In America, a headache specific questionnaire, the "Headache Disability Inventory" (HDI), has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a German version, the "Inventar zur Beeinträchtigung durch Kopfschmerzen" (IBK).	3.5286959106157147
94 consecutive patients with a primary headache disorder (59 female, 35 male; mean age 40 +/- 12 years) were examined.	4.450058438432675
Cronbach's alpha was a=0.90, the test-retest-reliability after three months was r=0.87.	3.0004110365926406
An analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test-retest-reliability of these subscales.	2.853749366745664
The scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly.	4.163201917183796
In post-hoc-analyses, however, cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales.	3.7722036863899473
The total score of the IBK was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month (r=0.41; p<0.0003) but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters.	3.3472149859801776
It can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies.	5.721476425238255
Age and menstrual cycle have an important influence on the breast.	3.934078459571606
This well-known fact is experienced in the daily routine of gynecologists and radiologists.	3.541711913715678
The number of publications addressing the effect of these influences on imaging, however, is surprisingly low.	3.5182930047653937
The aim of this work is to describe the influences of age and menstrual cycle on the breast and to address their clinical relevance for mammography and MR mammography.	3.164492137499571
Therefore, own data are presented concerning the age and menstrual cycle influences on breast parenchyma in dynamic MR mammography.	3.0945502385400916
Literature data are used to correlate mammography and MR imaging findings with these influences.	4.127333015716158
The changes of the breast due to age and menstrual cycle have important direct implications on performing and reading conventional mammography and MR mammography.	3.129208559316873
The knowledge of these changes is also helpful in the interpretation of findings when comparing different methods.	3.3667417923982055
Finally, the data gained by using imaging methods enable important basic insights into physiology and physiopathology of the breast in vivo.	3.1540912999084245
As part of our neonatal screening program we applied tandem mass spectrometry on 128.225 dried blood samples for detection of inborn errors of metabolism.	2.6940174521369897
Appendectomy is one of the most frequent surgical procedures.	3.7868265033161097
Accuracy in the clinical diagnosis of acute non-specific appendicitis, however, suffers from the fact that the symptoms and clinical findings of acute appendicitis can be mimicked by many other abdominal diseases.	4.43756445645365
The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, therefore, can only be definitely confirmed by pathomorphological analysis, the criteria of which are reviewed in this paper.	3.9869218362299823
Special emphasis is given to distinct variants of acute appendicitis and the significance of neuroappendicopathy.	3.4179782427474708
Extra-articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint (genu varum or valgum) are treatments proven over many years.	3.2871506124391137
The middle and long term results shows many patients are very satisfied.	3.6196929379084923
Unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores.	3.0925722336167287
The good results by infra- and supracondylar osteotomies - some of them for 15 years and more - have to be achieved by prosthesis first.	3.7356405197880984
The important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning, the miss load, and the instability of the joint; these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency.	3.7889636442817505
Therefore, indication of infra- or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient.	3.1819673794046777
The most important fact is the condition of the joint, especially the quality of bone, the instability of the joint, and the loss of bone.	5.209751684533978
Given the right indication, the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint.	3.596923264219863
Also, there are still chances to do another operation, such a prothesis.	3.668060640229716
A prothesis can be implanted if the osteotomy has no chance to preserve the joint.	3.3105047965614283
Psychic trauma may be followed by a variety of unpredictable reactions by the subject, which differ individually and are dependant upon the situation.	3.724083747695962
Differentiation between psychic crises and psychiatric emergency situations (PES) is often difficult as the first might proceed into the second and definitions of the two tend to blur.	3.5348320492358027
This article aims to overview the different psychic and psychiatric disturbances which are relevant in preclinical emergency medicine.	2.971300227431851
A definition is offered to outline PES that require immediate medical intervention and crises due to psycho-social reasons.	2.882282759227321
For the most important disturbances and syndromes the differential diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies are presented.	4.454727931176165
Acute pancreatitis is a multietiologic entity with rather diverse clinical courses.	3.1094920015610157
To further improve therapeutic results a standardized approach should be used.	3.342982467914746
For effective treatment the differentiation between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis is crucial.	3.3923661268889336
All patients with signs of pancreatic necroses during abdominal ultrasound and patients with organ insufficiencies should undergo a CT-scan to define exactly the nature and the extent of the disease.	3.397418833904499
Primarily all patients are treated conservatively.	4.323170866600247
Main indications for operative intervention are signs for infection of pancreatic necroses and an acute abdomen due to local complications of acute pancreatitis.	3.529620380008868
In cases of biliary origin an elective cholecystectomy has to be performed during a free interval to prevent a recurrence.	3.4940178830595308
Objective: Diagnosis of osteomyelitis is difficult in early state of disease.	3.503396568945672
Usually, characteristic X-ray findings cannot be obtained during the first week of disease.	4.176128777781607
Sonography, scintigraphy and magnetic resonance tomography were compared at clinical manifestation of osteomyelitis.	3.7360910278492443
A 73-year old female patient is known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) since 1989.	3.8836431608546755
After a transmural anterolateral myocardial infarction with the development of a large apical aneurysma of the anterior wall, a previously measured gradient of 11 mm Hg in the LVOT is no longer detected.	3.7434507119820304
As a consequence of this casuistry, "pseudo-myectomy" caused by myocardial as an example of an uncommon spontaneous course of HOCM.	2.891514556149212
Aim: Intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes Type I.	4.273273751358372
Intensified insulin therapy includes an basis-bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, several times daily blood glucose self-monitoring, self-adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far-reaching liberalization of nutrition.	3.021170044484866
The patients learn selfmanagement of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program.	3.2276203772613976
The effectivity of this program is evaluated in the routine care.	3.838584202116474
The treatment of idiopathic scoliosis over 40  ° (Cobb) during the growth period is under discussion concerning the indication for conservative or surgical treatment.	3.1876400718772357
Curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity, vertebral rotation, rigidity of the curve, the skeletal age, the age and sex of the patient, the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve.	3.934445174685125
In scoliosis over 40  ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period.	3.276249457416299
Progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major scolioses, especially in young patients (Risser sign 0 and 1).	3.885528172033424
The purpose of this study was to evaluate low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist.	3.6075087329250466
Between August 1995 and May 1997, 75 patients at the Unfallchirurgische Universitätsklinik, Mainz, Germany, with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination, X-ray and MRI imaging.	4.184078287518786
MRI analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying MRI experience without knowledge of the patient's history.	4.2626062728482434
The sensitivity and specifity of the more [U1] and the less experienced [U2] radiologist ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 61 to 100% (U2).	2.8121179827977842
Positive and negative predictive value ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 58 to 100% (U2); accuracy ranged from 92 to 100% (U1) and from 77 to 100% (U1).	2.4109745864632717
We conclude that the results of low-field MRI are comparable with those of high-field MRI and that differences in the results of the experienced and less experienced radiologist can be established.	4.565496115613409
In intervention trials it was without exception possible to influence the development of atherosclerosis by a reduction of the LDL-cholesterol and an increase in HDL-cholesterol and to reduce complications like myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, angina or heart failure.	4.156058110119182
Changes of lifestyle can be effective, but are rarely accepted and are difficult to communicate.	3.307267351654372
Dermatosurgery has been gaining in importance in recent years.	3.1117690934136832
The increase in the number of operations of moderate and extreme severity was especially marked.	3.3190784765733543
Out-patient dermatosurgery was also performed mainly by dermatologists as opposed to other specialties.	3.0969014906649037
From 1988 to 1992 dermatologists in private practice recorded an increase of 40.6% in the number of operative procedures they performed.	3.8215645224262116
The importance of dermatosurgery in hospital and private practice can be expected to continue increasing in the future; dermatologists must therefore prepare themselves for the present and future challenges inherent in surgery of the skin.	3.5198876976084104
There is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance.	3.210649496100975
Intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enables Doppler measurement of mitral inflow pattern (E/A ratio).	2.740837392038466
The E/A ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation.	3.28091937578025
In the present study we compared the time course of the E/A ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation () assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	3.0265145100458857
After ethical approval, 12 patients undergoing CABG surgery were studied.	3.4309080869203634
Measurements of the E/A ratio and  were performed after induction of anesthesia (I), immediately prior to CPB with the pericardium open (II), 5 min after CPB (III), and after sternal closure (IV).	3.706826120222214
The E/A ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery (IV).	3.128513425735186
In contrast,  was increased immediately after CPB, but decreased after sternal closure (IV).	2.5252889991833394
Cardiac index and heart rate both increased after CPB.	3.502978614638768
The results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after CPB, as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation.	3.488153160857359
However,  improved rapidly to pre-CPB values.	3.274976975780931
The E/A ratio alone failed to detect the initial post-CPB alteration in left ventricular relaxation.	2.810658997627665
Acute exercise is followed by a mobilization of white blood cells, mainly induced by increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol.	3.27951138845167
NK-cells react the most intensive, they can increase fivefold after intensive exercise.	3.368392342360707
Additionally a weak acute-phase reaction occurs.	3.338881882897402
Most of these changes normalize during twenty-four hours.	3.0586339124752135
Parameters of the humoral immune system may be different from the pre-exercise levels up to seventy-two hours.	3.5404072567497464
Repeated physical exercise, which is typical for sports, is followed only by small changes of immunologic parameters under conditions of rest.	3.6744360425480025
Epidemiological studies give clues that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes can be described by a j-shaped curve.	3.5769897692736294
Moderately active subjects have the lowest rate of infection.	3.6002653812439775
For this influence of exercise on health mainly functional changes seem to be important.	3.5737151411453785
Especially after exccentric exercise immunological cells can be seen in the muscle tissue, which remove destructed tissue.	3.4175906712332704
Not very much is known about the role of the immune system in the regeneration of tendons and other bradytrophic tissues.	3.855450243739008
To achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of attaining a straight and solid septum, even in cases of marked deviations or severe post-traumatic deformities, we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a "compound graft".	3.6968023254838136
For this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed, and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are reconnected to each other to form a straight and solid plate.	3.2087992995410333
As connecting material we use a polydioxanon (PDS) foil.	2.934245826504845
The sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with PDS suture material.	3.019384836900799
The compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose.	3.1806291156263025
The PDS and suture material are usually resorbed within 8 months, excluding long-term complications.	3.3251418745976706
During the past 2 years this method was used in treating 38 patients.	3.5357172288801126
The surgical goal was attained in every case, and no immediate or long-term complications occurred.	3.9393287353939055
This method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better, significant correction of even severe septal deviations.	3.375882770198483
Two types of corticosteroid receptors have been identified in the brain and pituitary that play an important role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	2.7505581709790863
Evidently, a tight control of the concentration and function of these receptors is of prime importance for maintaining and regaining homeostasis after stressful challenges.	3.446149094127574
Here, we describe a novel mechanism revealing a rapid upsurge in MR density in the hippocampus (a limbic structure highly involved in HPA axis regulation) after an acute psychologically stressful challenge.	2.885383456250005
This rise in MR is accompanied by a stronger MR-mediated inhibitory control of the HPA axis.	3.738167626013275
Thus, an acute stressful experience results in a reorganization of the HPA axis involving a principal role of the hippocampal MR.	3.297629511174653
This novel mechanism may be of significance for increasing our understanding of the etiology of stress-related disorders.	3.992995188974235
The wide variety of therapeutic effects make neuroleptics potent drugs in the treatment of pain.	4.124380335769667
Until now there has been no proof of their analgesic potency; in spite of this fact, neuroleptics are used to treat chronic pain states on the assumption that they do have analgesic potency.	3.917686361556737
A metaanalysis was performed and 48 publications reviewed.	3.6090584880686825
Thirty-four, the majority of the studies, are case reports, retrospective analyses or non-randomised cohort studies.	3.898879334387977
Most of these reports attest to a positive effect.	3.3313626050590255
However, only ten out of fifteen studies with a higher statistical study power describe a possible analgesic effect.	3.015591744093341
None of the studies could differentiate between the effects of analgesia and sedation of the drugs used.	3.7675382880797468
The metaanalysis provides no evidence of intrinsic analgesic properties of neuroleptics for their use as adjuvant analgesics.	3.2397974394304243
Studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimised when early signs of stroke are recognised and treatment is initiated within 3 hours from symptom onset.	3.4764427140804197
For most patients there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.	4.225639697119097
Many factors are responsible for this time delay: signs and symptoms often go unrecognised by patients, relatives and bystanders and stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff.	3.286354628831514
Although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window, this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education.	3.42988066257659
For the future, we hope that emergency medical services (EMS) will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke.	3.137518526703102
Standard of care by the EMS personnel includes maintenance of oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension as well as hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.	3.967822858322268
A decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or "wrapping" may lead to a partial loss of the arterial Windkessel-function.	3.68093339627513
The following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance.	3.437310023999169
This approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta, like extracorporal circulation, cardioplegia or blood loss.	3.2330137259942315
Flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention, and following Fourier Transformation, the aortic input impedance was calculated.	3.6205333205241095
Mean pressure, mean flow, and total peripheral resistance were unaltered, while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the "wrapping" procedure.	3.4183401198153263
Thus, it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load.	3.931355771531321
Cervical lymphadenopathies are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology.	3.425548623184678
There are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists.	3.7498768605776576
To gain further information it is advisable to perform sonographically controlled fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNP).	2.894926926624108
If there is no reliable result, it is necessary to remove a lymph node.	3.7725675493493953
We report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis X in lymph nodes.	3.068538540698911
A 63-year-old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about 6 weeks previously.	3.620783020241805
The preliminary examinations (FNP/blood examinations) revealed no pathological findings.	2.9064321294993603
Only the histological examination delivered the diagnosis of histiocytosis X.	4.037112865702739
Systemic manifestation was excluded by staging examinations.	3.355754758023522
No further therapy was necessary after lymph node extirpation.	3.225051499691303
We report our preliminary results using a new magnetic resonance imaging technique for visualization of the urinary tract.	3.890107062090993
Using the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), we were able to obtain images of the urinary tract comparable to those obtained by conventional excretory urography.	3.215109135467577
The major advantage of our technique is that besides good morphologic visualization, the excretion of gadolinium-DTPA can be studied simultaneously.	2.940865010163151
We demonstrate our preliminary results in selected cases.	3.2731939398003513
Microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all cancellous bones by means of suitable preparation techniques.	3.494522010692925
Histologically, these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local overloaded parts of the trabeculae.	2.958173913196747
Using a preparation technique that allows combined two- and threedimensional analysis, 26 normal human spines and 11 osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus.	2.8911984974435145
Microcallus formations occur frequently in people over 45 years of age.	2.8434355374484377
They are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males.	3.562538842325852
The number of microcallus formations depends more on the microarchitecture of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters.	2.639387320351953
In about 33 % of cases microfractures are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation.	3.0765959266947713
In noninvasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus.	3.0068631096518694
Although it indicates instability of the bone structure, microcallus formation is not a purely negative mechanism.	4.156933502417083
It stabilizes and regenerates the bone tissue.	3.1755100927338327
Furthermore, complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae.	2.671300546134392
Osteoporosis is not the result of an inability to form microcallus.	3.852159974812703
DNA cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis.	3.434985725252064
The detection of a DNA-aneuploid stemline supports the diagnosis of a high-grade malignant bone neoplasm, even in small biopsies.	4.30040916532234
Solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have DNA-diploid cell populations.	3.3900052347033944
Their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a DNA-aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation.	3.2282694548486615
Although noise in general can induce hearing loss, environmental noise represents an important risk for children, teenagers and young adults.	3.6433871753722613
Epidemiological investigations now support the occurrence of an increasing number of irreversible hearing losses in these groups.	3.91106694659645
Major causes of hearing loss are toys (guns), explosives and electroacoustically amplified music delivered by head sets or heard in discotheques and open air concerts.	2.7266434653421823
The development of arthroscopic wrist surgery has helped to understand the anatomy and pathology of the wrist joint.	3.2805419310297705
One of the most important functions of the arthroscopic inspection in the radiocarpal and mediocarpal joints is the evaluation of the wrist stability.	4.037729254739653
State of the art in the hand surgery today includes a combination of arthroscopic and arthroscopic assisted operations.	3.9455334200051246
The arthroscopy of the wrist offers significant information independent from the standard radiological diagnostic tools.	3.739681473070439
TFCC lesions and scapholunate dissociation remain to be the most common causes for arthroscopic wrist surgery.	4.283719955918414
Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a consequence of vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency and in the majority of cases due to alcoholism.	4.205093140764137
We report here the case of a 26-year-old male alcoholic who had stayed helplessly at home for 4 days until hospital admission.	3.1271898283457875
Clinical diagnosis was difficult due to major disturbance of consciousness.	3.2371621485707256
MRI showed an increase in signal intensity (T2-, FLAIR-weighted) around the third ventricle, the quadrigeminal bodies, the fornices, the mamillary bodies, the floor of the fourth ventricle and around the aqueduct.	3.2005482396886773
These findings were indicative of WE although of unusual extent.	2.805693213844253
In this case MRI correlated well with clinical symptomatology.	2.9860821898837147
Therapy with thiamine was started immediately and symptoms as well as MRI findings resolved partially.	3.950208183649164
The presented case illustrates the diagnostic usefulness of MRI in WE especially if the patient is of reduced consciousness and clinical investigation is limited.	3.4880168441747896
Background: SLO microperimetric examination after the extraction of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) shows absolute scotoma in the area of pigment epithelial loss.	2.9978808238545405
Laser treatment also causes complete functional loss.	3.058273115362374
The functional results of these two methods should be compared before the surgical procedure is expanded.	4.546524526479883
Three case reports of a pseudomeniscus and an angiomatoid vascular proliferation of the synovial membrane as rare aseptic complications of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty are presented.	3.240169178549589
Neither complication can be confirmed by clinical examination, laboratory findings or diagnostic imaging techniques.	3.8465641919442324
Strabismus surgery in children is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).	3.985473642979235
We report on a case of a 23 years old man who was polytraumatized in a car accident.	3.1432953916765825
He survived with excellent clinical outcome, but after 113 days after the accident he collapsed, massive bleeding out of the mouths started and the patient died within a few minutes.	4.055938153351993
A gastric ulcer bleeding was assumed, but autopsy showed the beak-in of a posttraumatic aortic aneurysm into the esophagus.	2.995489770086936
The difficulties of in time diagnosis of thoracic aorta lesions are discussed.	3.0048115363363705
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral leukoplakia (OL) in HIV-positive patients and to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features and the presence of Candida hyphae and viral infections (HSV 1, 2, HPV, EBV and CMV) by immunocytochemical methods using mono- or polyclonal antibodies.	3.4792882333557813
A total of 269 HIV-seropositive patients, (222 men, median age 36.7 years and 47 women, median age 32 years) were registered.	3.1965736843564825
OL occurred in 20/269 (7.4%) patients (men, smokers, median age 38 years); the non-homogeneous form was observed in 11%.	3.9305702763771095
A lesional biopsy specimen was obtained from 8/20 patients.	3.32770629115675
Specimens did not show signs of epithelial dysplasia.	3.8586975275996487
Candida hyphae were evident in 2/8 cases.	3.8392855046822514
Two patients tested positive for HPV and CMV; antibodies against EBV, HSV1 and 2 were negative.	2.829580444240265
In conclusion, the prevalence of OL is comparatively high in this group of HIV-seropositive patients (7.4% vs. 0.9-2.2%).	3.3633126019001036
Moreover, the mean age of the study group at the time of diagnosis for oL was lower (38 years vs. 60 years).	4.276245917229578
Damage/dysfunctioning of the heart forms part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in sepsis and SIRS.	3.6561852640500283
This acute septic cardiomyopathy is often underestimated in degree and relevance, although about 10% of all sepsis fatalities are due to intractable heart failure.	3.378415762760215
This potentially reversible cardiomyopathy is characterized by a considerable pump failure, not primarily ischemic, with coronary blood flow being normal or even enhanced; the left and right ventricle is enlarged as a consequence of an increased ventricular compliance.	3.354618939141693
Damage of the heart can further be aggravated in case of additional right ventricular impairment due to pulmonary hypertension in ARDS.	3.7628750519697802
SIRS-cardiomyopathy in non-infectious MODS has common traits with acute septic cardiomyopathy.	3.9227254964449756
The pathogenesis of heart disease in sepsis and SIRS is multifactorial, the endotoxin/TNF/NO/ cGMP-cascade representing a main negative inotropic axis.	2.815432043989792
Therapy of acute septic cardiomyopathy and SIRS-cardiomyopathy at present is still mainly symptomatic (volume substitution, inotropic/vasoactive agents); causal therapeutic principles are, however, put to test in the context of a comprehensive concept of causal sepsis treatment.	3.2233836736901793
Fractures of the distal metaphysis of the tibia often include an extension into the ankle.	3.477726196569855
Intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis should reduce the high incidence of soft tissue and ankle problems and should be an alternative to open plate fixation, with good ultimate functional outcome.	4.066546917793365
Between January 1993 and December 1995, a prospective study on 49 patients with distal metaphyseal tibia fracture and involvement of the ankle was performed.	3.9544786412522845
All the fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis, and plate fixation in cases of fibula fractures.	3.736762784196129
There were 27 men and 22 women with an average age of 46.4  +/-  12.7 years (range 21-90).	3.1043791482933947
In most studies of the use of intramedullary nailing in distal tibial fractures the classification has been inadequate.	3.6714614117346027
Therefore a new classification according to Robinson et al.	2.9619838811270895
(1995) was used: 10 fractures were type II B (20.4 %), 13 were type II C (26.5 %), and 26 patients suffered a combination of type II B and type II C (53.1 %).	3.851577626550889
This fracture type was defined as type II D for use in this study.	3.6735779274685063
The severity of soft tissue injury was recorded using the Gustilo system in case of open (n = 19) and the Tscherne system in case of closed fractures (n = 30).	3.8846246992041165
In 31 patients distal tibia fracture was accompanied by a fracture of the fibula, which was first stablized using a plate.	3.998962188641389
For reconstruction of the distal articular surface, covered screw osteosynthesis was done.	4.3424526313513585
At the next step intramedullary nails were inserted and were statically locked proximally and distally.	3.033089385620463
From January 1993 to February 1994, the reamed AO standard nail was used.	2.994038669734259
After introduction of the unreamed tibial nail (UTN) all fractures were treated by this implant.	3.5835265872060322
Full load on the operated leg was allowed after 8 weeks.	3.6162805693983655
Union of the fracture was assessed by standard radiological and clinical criteria.	4.96103029827749
Misalignment was defined as more than 5  ° of angular rotation.	4.257997773735445
Further surgery due to a valgus deformity in the ankle joint had to be done in three cases.	4.5222586353624905
There were no deep infections.	3.0435047726170583
Three patients had a superficial infection in the ankle area, but surgical debridement was not necessary.	3.900739228032533
A leg shortening was found in 4 cases, but it was less than 1 cm in every case.	4.9685805219448715
Therefore, surgical correction was not done.	3.4375775578919967
Patients were reviewed at intervals of 2, 6, and 12 weeks, and after 6, and at least 12 months.	4.779280638457551
Bone fusion was reached 12.8 weeks (range 9-21) after the operative treatment.	3.5606245364928535
A specific assessment of the ankle symptoms was made using the score of Olerud and Molander (1984).	3.666993702965185
In 29 patients excellent results were recorded.	3.259183282271627
A satisfactory result was attained with 17 patients and just 3 patients were found to be unsatisfactory.	3.4494504133775843
Although proximity of distal tibia fracture to the ankle makes the treatment more complicated than for fractures of the tibial diaphysis, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a good alternative to open reduction and plate fixation.	3.091773560416657
Therefore, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a safe and effective method of managing this type of fracture.	2.952597197593349
Laryngeal candidiasis is very rare in the absence of other more proximal diseases in the aerodigestive tract.	3.8392599863130026
The lesion shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or acanthosis and, given its rarity, may be confused with cancer.	3.272405548837564
In the present paper we report on a 56-year-old male patient who presented with hoarseness.	3.0551332797466015
Physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords.	3.496031179941361
The clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient (ten bottles of beer and 40 cigarettes per day) generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer.	3.644439411586195
The histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma; however, it could not provide a clear diagnosis.	3.943119128258447
Laryngeal papillomatosis and tuberculosis, which had been suspected, could be excluded.	3.7493246477743836
As the lesion progressed, further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis.	3.662780131233891
Systemic antimycotic treatment with fluconazol and amphotericin caused a complete remission.	3.320230414996592
Lymphatic spread of bronchial carcinoma can reach any part of the mediastinum, irrespective of the localisation of the primary tumor.	3.682557576140249
Metastatic spread may not affect al topographical lymph node positions, but this is unpredictable.	3.2742250168003455
The number of lymph nodes in each position varies.	3.42615083372891
Therefore, systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection includes all ipsilateral compartments of the mediastinum.	3.05658542306248
It is also possible to reach contralateral sites.	3.460476923810524
In right-sided thoracotomies the lymph node dissection is standardized.	4.151971803670259
Mobilizing the aortic arch and the large vessels also allows complete mediastinal dissection by a left-sided approach.	3.3308057110711244
The surgical technique is described.	3.2218281980772923
Perioperative morbidity does not increase.	3.4560645195525552
Systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the gold standard for evaluation of an exact pN stage.	3.6094925853639004
The stage-related survival rate is significantly improved.	3.5124848252502834
Therefore, it should be required that systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection be standard in the surgical treatment of bronchial carcinoma.	3.7023250319387104
In the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis.	3.924668889217679
A special case of a thirty-eight-year-old male asylant from Nepal was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain.	3.4809477148667707
To exclude testicular torsion, a diagnostic exploration of the scrotum was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation.	3.679050834560734
Under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared.	3.245867526087775
The diagnosis of filarial funiculitis was made after identifying the microfilariae in a blood vessel and in the peripheral blood smear.	3.513614897856683
A filaricide medication with diethylcarbamacine citran was administered with good symptomatic relief.	3.0397854955328083
We studied 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients with Parkinson-plus-syndrome, trying to improve patients' gait by application of various external rhythmic stimuli, including metronome stimulation (96 beats per minute=middle andante).	3.064325271125541
The test course of the patients was 4x10 meters and 3 U-turns.	4.22384504284867
The patients' gait quality under stimulation was compared with their free walk (velocity, number of steps, number of freezing episodes).	3.232361034403851
Metronome stimulation significantly reduced the time and number of steps needed for the test course and also diminished the number of freezing episodes.	3.915018992604537
March music stimulation was less effective and tactile stimulation (rhythmically tapping on the patient's shoulder) even produced negative results.	3.018896857034849
The positive effect of metronome stimulation was also found, when the tests were not performed inside the hospital building, but outside in the hospital parc.	3.4529123869784004
Metronome stimulation was comparably effective in both patient sub-groups examined in this study (M. Parkinson, Parkinson-plus-syndrome) and seems to be an important additional help in the treatment of these patients.	3.8257117685829027
Electronical metronomes are not expensive, easy in handling, and portable.	3.220373155153293
A theoretical explanation of metronome stimulation effectivity in patients with Parkinson's disease still needs to be elucidated.	3.8730809998698605
The occurrence of perineural epithelial complexes within the pancreas cannot always be regarded as evidence of malignancy.	3.068917643992861
Chronic pancreatitis can induce alterations in the anatomy of the organ with a histological picture comparable to that of neural invasion.	3.6951385934307326
The important criteria for differential diagnosis are neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells or their ductular morphology without atypia.	3.405711417634715
Objectives Repair of acute rupture of the Achilles tendon through a percutaneous technique under general, regional, or local anesthesia.	3.2974841850592544
Deciduosis of the appendix is a rare cause of acute appendicitis in pregnancy.	4.107180258863802
Ectopic decidual cells localized in the submesothelial stroma may represent a physiologic reaction of the pluripotent stromal cells to progestational hormonal stimulation.	3.1078062978486303
Less frequently, deciduosis is based on a preexisting extragenital endometriosis, visible in a localization other than strictly submesothelial, in residuals of cyclic proliferation and bleeding, and in endometrial glandular formations embedded in the decidual cells.	3.0167271376745632
In 14 patients with acute LBP the effect of manual therapy was examined.	3.7366195491457646
The examination was conducted with the Triflexometer, which is an electromechanical measuring instrument for examination of the posture and function of the spine.	3.8612080174960153
This instrument makes possible the measurement of the spine in resting as well as in moving positions, and it is also suitable for recording local disturbances of the movement.	4.34178483485824
In our study we measured the spine from C7 to S2 in the sagittal and frontal planes.	2.8118381467783062
Improvement in movement was detected in all patients following manual therapy, as well as in ante-, retro- and lateral flexion on both sides, and local functional disturbances also disappeared partially or totally.	3.636398005816662
Our study shows that the Triflexometer makes it possible to record the effect of manual therapy in acute LBP.	3.373325359337047
The proof of the local functional disturbances after manual therapy indicates that these patients have a higher risk of new episodes of acute LBP or perhaps of chronic LBP, and because of that there it is necessary to use other treatment forms.	3.6016972461795036
Diagnostic imaging after renal transplantation is of high importance in the differential diagnosis of peri-and postoperative complications.	3.62712682739819
Sonography with color duplex imaging is the method of choice in the diagnosis of acute transplant rejection.	3.8838011374839385
MRI is an additional method in the diagnosis of transplant dysfunction especially in diagnosis of perirenal fluid collections.	3.9090739191888764
MR angiography and MR urography are noninvasive diagnostic modalities with the potential to replace angiography and pyelography.	3.20658954073825
Angiography, complemented by carbon dioxide angiography, still is the gold standard in the diagnosis of transplant artery stenosis.	3.6241699446527362
Nutrients and trophic factors independent of nutritional substrates influence the proliferation and the differentiation of the cells that make up the intestinal wall.	3.475617633961648
The resorptive mucosa must be differentiated from immunologically active cells of the "gut-associated lymphatic tissue" (GALT).	3.4058878982460747
Glutamine is the main oxidative substrate of enterocytes and an important nitrogen donor; its importance becomes apparent in very sick patients.	3.225718564973136
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are mainly important for immunological gut cells as precursors of NO and polyamine synthesis.	2.7854417149244806
Complex carbohydrates are fermented in the lower gut portions to short-chain fatty acids, mainly acetic, propionic and butyric acid.	3.0262542261580605
The trophic effect of these acids is also mediated via an improvement of blood flow.	3.8212174319359407
Among the trophic substances independent of nutrients are the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon and various growth factors, contributing to the maintenance of a eutrophic gut mucosa.	3.130228775876412
We investigated 88 Patients with a total of 102 angiographically diagnosed intracranial aneurysms by means of transcranial colour coded Duplex sonography (TCCD) during a time period of 15 months.	3.575329758187842
Both the size and teh localization of teh aneuryms were determined.	2.976475980427719
Seventy aneurysms (77%) with a diameter of 16 +/- 8 mm (6-55mm) were detectable, with excellent visualization in 36 (42%), moderate visualization in 34 (40%), and no sufficient visualization in 16 (16%) aneurysms, respectively.	4.2864445766188
In another 16 cases (16%) there was no sufficient vone window.	3.6478997856712554
Thrombotic material inside the aneurysm was detectable in 16/20 cases (75%), visualization of coil embolized aneurysms in 12/25 patients (48%).	3.381727874105363
TCCD allows the follow up of cerebral aneurysms, with the detection of thrombosis and treatment effects after embolization.	4.79591885972435
The method is not valid for the detection of intracranial aneurysms	4.316043993068031
The authors report the case of a young patient suffering from plasmacellular osteomyelitis of the thoracic spine, a unusual localisation of this type of chronic osteomyelitis.	3.608659862777605
They discuss the role of imaging diagnostic modalities in this disease, focussing on MRI.	4.133618062132465
The Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) is a new instrument to analyze the three-dimensional structure of the retina.	4.2278770598472635
It is based on confocal laser scanning technology.	3.7479116461454063
Scientific interest has so far focused on the follow-up of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage.	3.6808488540127744
As parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be reproduced with a high degree of accuracy, this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk.	3.6660514109868707
Evaluation of three patients, aged between three months and five years because of failure to thrive and persistent diarrhea revealed the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth.	3.9602594237037922
A combination of a typical history, endoscopy, laboratory, radiological and histological methods as well as the breath hydrogen test were used.	3.75284551759647
All patients had preexisting intestinal disease: two (former premature infants) had been operated several times because of necrotizing enterocolitis including resection of larger parts of small bowel.	3.0595926901783717
The third patient was suffering from pancolonic Hirschsprung's disease.	2.9158827993969823
All patients gained weight and reported less complaints after antibiotic treatment with metronidazole.	3.0189854669511162
Discussion: Small bowel bacterial overgrowth has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of failure to thrive, especially in cases with preexisting intestinal disease.	3.9756336986810257
The diagnosis may be substantiated by a combination of indirect methods.	3.651838906095185
Direct bacteriologic analysis is difficult.	3.4747297473089556
Usually, antibiotic treatment leads to a good weight gain after a short period of time.	3.374977102710355
In contrast to carotid endarterectomy, the indication for vertebral surgery is not standardized.	3.4562400060633958
In a prospective study including 44 patients, it was investigated whether extended diagnostics help in making the decision as to whether operative treatment should be given.	3.752336848999921
The diagnostic procedures included DSA, CCT, MRI, 24 h ECG, otoneurological, and neurological examination, and ultrasonic flow measurement.	3.115936337227201
We compared the diagnostic results before and after surgery with the subjective symptoms of the patients.	3.6660257307947517
In the follow up period (6 - 9 months), 72% of the patients had improved or were without complaints.	3.9433666191481573
The validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement.	3.015548765046699
In our opinion, exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery.	2.9156245526784494
It has long been a goal to develop a means to measure squint angles in three dimensions simultaneously.	3.293881030654714
A three-dimensional binocular method is naturally needed especially with surgical procedures that affect three dimensions of ocular motility.	3.160299444658315
In situations of depressed myocardial function, the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently.	3.7238612370766404
In different pathophysiological situations, such as chronic heart failure, open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation, cardiac transplantation, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and reversible myocardial dysfunction, which may represent a final common pathway.	4.257503898797289
The available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function, i.e., contractility, preload, afterload, and heart rate, by cytokines.	3.182490942099932
Potential mechanisms include the -adrenoceptor- and nitric oxide pathway, as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis.	3.6300697995985893
Interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge.	3.2146109148650424
A prospective randomized study was designed to determine the effect of postoperative water contact on tissue healing.	3.7036783799481987
A total of 121 patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups.	2.7406671023834197
The first group was permitted to shower postoperatively, allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water, the second group was instructed to keep the incision dry.	2.892111974170671
Water contact, wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed.	3.7064662417129273
There was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection.	3.341082853312838
In children and adolescents motor/vocal tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior are known to be closely related.	2.934899161636304
Thereby, a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics/rituals/obsessive-compulsive traits to clinically relevant obsessions and compulsions could be described.	2.74017311057803
As neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits (sensorimotor circuit in tic symptomatology, orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive-compulsive behavior) were postulated.	2.526384405207148
For both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to counterregulate tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior, respectively, and psychopharmacological agents can be administerd to compensate dysbalances in neurotransmitter systems.	3.025102681018807
In case of a mixed symptomatologic picture it is necessary to include interventions for both pols of the symptom-continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient.	3.5857074807269673
As laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established, interest in legal aspects increases.	3.183733868987663
The legal cases dealt with in Germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in 1989 were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications.	3.594246903296381
Of 40 cases, 16 were judged to be cases of malpractice, whereas 24 were not.	2.8514993484920876
The most common cause was injury of the common bile duct (26 cases).	3.339187637470269
Seven of these 26 cases were judged to be cases of malpractice, 2 of these as grave errors.	3.0319995634816967
The main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy, delayed revision, laparoscopic revisions and not reverting to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations.	3.1421935597948125
Purpose of this review is, to highlight key issues in transplantation medicine today and to summarise basic information on current state of perfused organ transplantation.	3.150836427075579
There is special emphasis on ethical and legal considerations with regard to living donor transplantation, brain death concept, donor consent and organ allocation.	3.382203974102292
Transplantation frequencies and the impact of whole organ transplantation on the treatment concept for patients with end stage organ disease is heavily dependent on donor and organ availability.	3.803790923763164
Organ donor rate of 25 to 30 donors per million inhabitants per year seems to yield sufficient organ supply for patients on renal replacement therapy.	2.9202153076439066
15 to 20 liver transplantations per million inhabitants per year, my be sufficient, to cover the need of organs for non malignant end stage liver diseases.	3.4217981290734727
This frequency my be achieved by increasing donor rates and employing "split techniques", where one liver is used for two recipients.	3.5284717090256588
One year graft survival in kidney transplantation can be expected to be between 85 and 90 %, one year patient survival in heart and liver transplantation can be expected to be beyond 80 %.	3.226193725638631
Patient- and/or graft loss after the first year is in the order of 1 to 5 %.	4.613285004396865
Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a promising method of treating different types of tumors.	3.3868706502445884
To increase the effectiveness of LITT, a new thermo-controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed.	3.7241167100892
This laser system consists of a laser applicator 3 mm in diameter, insertion equipment and an Nd:YAG laser source.	3.4232084671877767
The power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by thermosensors in a water-cooling system of the laser applicator.	3.677864961952125
In in vivo experiments in five pigs, within 10 min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of 3 cm and 5 cm in diameter.	3.526791116166392
Via ultrasound we observed in real time the increasing coagulation zone that appeared as a hyperechogenic halo.	3.309412397604686
However, due to perifocal edema, the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound.	3.011376978458866
Macroscopically and microscopically, the coagulation zones showed well-demarcated borders of the coagulation lesions, and the surrounding tissue appeared vital.	4.033433973694215
The reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis.	3.1724026062937374
In the course of 4 weeks, the surrounding scar capsule, containing fibrocytes, biliary ductules and collagen fibers enlarged.	3.2194426569873857
As a result, the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed.	3.006455563923137
The absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo-controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable.	3.5910978262175663
Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy (research).	3.250036479630532
Related to adults, attachment theory has to be reconceptualized which is done in another part of this paper.	3.999839744345986
Finally, some common methods for the assessment of adult attachment are described which play an important role in clinical studies (these will be the content of the part 2 of this review).	3.813128229591591
Inflammation-mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation.	3.53103693298491
We found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process, in addition cytokines are increased.	3.692114001608255
Treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation.	3.329600133957372
Anxiolysis with drugs and psychoprophylaxis are both recognised methods of preoperative preparation.	3.171925993646004
The beneficial effects of anxiolytics, however, appear to be difficult to prove.	4.9644664856566205
In this study a comparison was made of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol levels.	3.577624456041332
In group I 19 children recieved only psychological treatment, while in group II 21 children received 0.2 mg/kg midazolam orally.	3.211891521506099
Measuring points were directly before medication, 30 min afterward, and at induction of anaesthesia.	3.3700783086284964
During the observation period the patients (5-10 years old) remained calm.	5.243431445197717
At the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range; 30 min after premedication the HR and BP were significantly higher in group I than in group II.	4.218214366141147
In contrast to group I, epinephrine levels in group II were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication.	3.8721884499053387
In both groups, norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication.	3.0279477345641204
Cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam.	4.885080804031587
HR, BP, as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children.	3.7450353552111038
A case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented.	2.867296173149761
The diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging.	3.193989597476837
The diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid.	2.9700645535724064
This is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy.	3.4296380005169342
Myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of intraparietal masses visualized at echocardiography.	2.9264999679560173
The incidence of hepatitis A infections has decreased due to improved hygienic conditions in Germany.	3.086406080410025
However, hepatitis A is one of the most important diseases imported to the country.	3.446976159335829
Currently, more than the half of all registered hepatitis A infections are acquired in foreign countries.	3.3632858949475475
According to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people (age below 50 years) are not immunized and, subsequently, this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries.	3.196922773226952
Therefore, a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis A (Southern Europe, Africa, South America, and Asia).	2.9291177972196296
Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram-positive organism, which have in common a fermentative metabolism with lactic acid as the major end-product.	3.3137524330591317
Except for bifidobacteria, the LAB are phylogenetically closely related.	2.829926515669233
They directly contribute to human well-being as they are the most important germs in the production process of fermented foods which constitute one fourth of our diet.	3.681401299460659
They are, furthermore, an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora.	4.013179051128405
The genus Streptococcus contains highly pathogenic species which can be clearly differentiated from the useful germs.	3.5540472613840572
The intestinal flora contains such species of the genus Lactobacillus that are also important in food fermentation and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore, can be found exclusively in this ecological niche.	3.430292221223083
A special status characterises bifidobacteria and enterococci.	2.9834230326957822
The former are located in a separate phylogenetic branch and also occur virtually exclusively in the intestines.	3.217425065478061
Enterococci are rather ubiquitous, participate in indigenous food fermentations, are found in the mucosal flora and are counted as opportunistic pathogens.	3.059800921164358
To influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects LAB are isolated from the intestinal flora, grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or additions to food (usually fermented milk).	2.973904928406689
These bacteria are termed "probiotics".	3.4429977658939697
The exposition of consumers to high numbers of germs belonging to one or a few species needs an evaluation of their safety for human health.	3.0233020731450053
In this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion.	3.522778754903219
In front of this background, LAB in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe, nevertheless some restrictions have to be made.	3.6338521677612285
Generally, the germs used should not contain genes encoding transmissible resistance to antibiotics.	2.7070338033749444
In addition they should not produce biogenic amines (e.g.	2.597275195104622
histamine, tyrosine or phenylethylamine) and should not degrade mucine.	3.1159170372896545
The assessment may also include the following: absence of a potential for deconjugation of bile salts, induction of platelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen and fibronectine.	3.031630919703565
These examinations may be required as certain LAB have been identified in clinical isolates.	3.607738759621917
The isolates were, however, obtained in the most majority of cases from debilitated patients.	4.344191576684525
The germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment, organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated.	3.8331052186132233
Dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon.	3.53363307561178
In these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat.	3.0143498605389842
The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical CT in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis.	2.919226792638189
In 20 patients with clinically suspected thrombosis CT angiography was performed.	3.6000468439482134
In order to acquire also arterial vessels, a short delay of about 22 s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected.	3.884019543976909
By this method we found an occlusion of the MCA in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis.	3.8204778968924415
In all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an "empty delta" sign.	2.651236093363462
With irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus.	3.739074127413331
The MIP reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage.	4.027852924367335
In three patients MR angiograms were available for comparison.	3.095610525753865
The smaller veins, such as the v. vermis inferior, were less clearly depicted than in CT angiography.	3.440072281959048
CT angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis.	3.2980299931304433
It can be performed immediately after non-enhanced CT.	3.809674696125213
According to our present experience CT angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis.	3.5768118034037655
Coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.	4.061862815956778
Only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries, however.	3.2933058291759845
With intravascular ultrasound, on the other hand, pathological changes in the vascular wall can be recorded.	3.876826216331906
Despite typical symptoms, an angiographical image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries.	3.6541340766204526
In such cases, intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings.	2.9744628645250533
Two cases are used to illustrate this.	3.6442829770246092
In those, angiographic visualization of the coronary arteries was unable to produce an unambiguous finding despite typical clinical symptoms, yet intravascular ultrasound could detect considerable arteriosclerotic wall changes.	3.079453616589052
Purpose: The pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex, but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear.	3.079247461711604
The cerebral cortex is involved in coordinating micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions.	2.951702395481205
The present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by EEG power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned.	3.0937281165414103
We also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation (IVES) therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity.	3.424589779285023
Background: Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe, potential vision-threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment.	3.1451066469925544
In general, any therapy has been dis-cussed controversially in the literature.	2.8758898515560722
The usefulness of surgical decompression of the optic nerve has been confirmed in several studies but is still not recommended in principle.	3.927157642960829
In recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) in otherwise healthy adults.	2.8784860060974458
It is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about 30 %.	3.2503539093285867
This paper describes the history of two patients with severe streptococcal TSLS.	4.30326337448359
Various aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy are discussed.	4.774091192152131
Purpose: To test, whether axial, coronal and sagittal MIP and MPR reconstructions of diagnostic quality can be obtained from 1-mm collimation MSCT data of the chest for the evaluation of thoracic anatomy and pathology.	3.663798440462816
The risk to health posed by a sedentary lifestyle is a problem of our times.	3.0287138818041797
In contrast to the previous assumption that only fairly high-intensity sporting exercise undertaken over a minimum period of 20 min produces health-related benefits, recent studies have shown that even everyday activitites (climbing stairs, brisk walking and cycling) can have a benedicial effects on health, particularly in those who take little exercise.	3.050250363474253
So now the recommendation is: exercise of moderate intensity lasting 30 min at least 5 times a week, corresponding to an energy consumption of about 150 kacl/day or 1000 kcal/week.	2.8697804232062585
The results of experimental studies on sport and arthritis and sport and osteoporosis point to the advisability of taking up or maintaining an active sporting lifestyle.	2.788467608235475
For one thing, it can be assumed that a moderate amount of movement does not increase the risk of developing arthritis: for another, sporting activity during early and late childhood produces a high maximum bone mass, therby delaying the development of osteoporosis in later life.	3.3523137286945515
More difficult, however, is deciding on a suitable method for motivating inactive individuals to increase their level of physical acitivity.	3.34693595373407
A model that has proved effective in smoking cessation programmes, and one that can also be applied to exercise counselling (transtheoretical model), can help in the selection of an appropriate counselling strategy.	3.746638112140229
Depending on whether an individual is inactive, or sporadically or regularly active, each one employs his or her own strategies primarily to maintain this lifestyle.	2.896926401675504
Assuming that the counselling is adapted to the level of activity, the patient's attitude and behaviour can be influenced both more effectively and more economically.	3.702366502505261
Background: Photorefraktive keratectomy (PRK) is the most frequent refractive surgical procedure worldwide.	3.686177025169757
The central corneal thickness is reduced due to removal of the anterior stroma, including Bowman's layer, with a laser beam.	4.014823825217738
This procedure results in considerable alterations of the corneal structure.	3.257005390079287
What does this mean for the mechanical properties of the cornea?	4.371671913123756
Beginning in the 1920s Wilhelm Reich developed the fundamental concepts of a body-oriented psychotherapy out of psychoanalysis.	2.9072124565938204
He started from considerations of egopathology, sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns.	3.3770161277201938
Characterological and bodily attitudes were understood as defence-patterns against emotions, which function not only psychologically but also bodily.	2.8880618620118166
Thus he began to mobilize repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions.	2.8010602764053125
That way their meaning in the person's history could be understood and a self-healing process restarted.	3.305498836931843
This approach to release constrained energy is still valid for neoreichian schools such as bioenergetics, biodynamics, biosynthesis and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy.	2.952488356675885
Bodily processes are used as indicators for the processes and successes of therapies.	3.595787615449367
Besides there are impulses in modern body psychotherapies to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts.	3.276361970443149
Recurrent phlebothromboses in young patients with subsequent severe postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous leg ulcers may be caused by underlying hereditary disorders of hemostasis or may occur as part of other congenital syndromes.	3.175196166884852
The most common hereditary disorders of hemostasis in this respect appear to be deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S, and activated protein C resistance (mutations of factor V).	2.9850425871895827
Less frequently, dysfibrinogenemia, increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, or deficiencies of tissue plasminogen activator or heparin cofactor II may be found.	2.7528960320302014
Klinefelter's syndrome and homocystinuria are prime examples of those rare congenital disorders indirectly associated with an elevated risk of thrombosis in young individuals.	3.566029925514459
Early diagnosis of these disorders will allow timely treatment, preventive care and counselling of patients as well as family members.	3.868682808745702
There is great variability in the distribution of contrast medium according to the individual morphology of the epidural space and the way it is injected.	3.694858434418323
Results of investigations of the anatomy of the spinal canal and epidural space performed with anatomic specimens, epiduroscopy, and conventional and computed tomographic (CT) epidurography are sometimes contradictory.	3.3923505564220187
We have performed CT epidurography in approximately 30 patients to date.	3.1012525073098964
Insights regarding the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space can help to interpret conventional epidurographies and to explain special features, such as the "rail-road-track phenomenon" or the plica mediana dorsalis.	3.363921853340006
Catheters were introduced into the thoracic epidural space on the day before the operation.	3.400880769568871
Conventional epidurographies were performed routinely after insertion of the catheters with a mobile X-ray apparatus, usually in the recovery room, using 5 ml iopamidol (Solutrast 250 M).	3.21273408649372
Selected patients (good mental state and stable psychic condition), after written consent and with approval of the local ethical committee, were investigated with CT epidurography using the same contrast medium (partly diluted).	3.3070080700341076
From among the CT scans performed until now, five characteristic images are presented and compared to conventional epidurographies.	4.386410605170147
When small volumes (5 mL) of iopamidol were injected slowly, we regularly observed a railroad-track phenomenon in the AP images of conventional epidurographies.	2.939005256623993
After rapid injection of larger volumes (10 - 15 ml), the spread was more homogeneous and sometimes outline a lighter zone of contrast distribution in the midline.	3.866097424260077
CT epidurography in these cases (5 out of 30 patients) revealed a plica mediana dorsalis.	3.5125825232062815
In the majority of the CT scans of the thoracic epidural space its anterior (ventral) compartment was unfilled by contrast medium.	3.26606650166519
According to the findings of several investigators, dura mater and ligamentum longitudinale posterius have grown together, so that an epidural space does not exist in ventral thoracic segments of the spinal canal.	3.1728069028893313
In lower thoracic and lumbar segments both structures are separate, and a wide anterior epidural space was present and filled with contrast medium.	3.371202004441513
In other cases the dorsal and dorsolateral epidural space was completely filled, but the contrast medium stopped behind the spinal nerves and surrounding dural sheaths, as if these structures, together with the connective tissue strands between them, formed a membrane that spread in a frontal plane.	3.2457310614428225
A railroad-track phenomenon is interpreted in the literature as the X-ray correlate of contrast medium spread in the subdural space, indicating an incorrect catheter position.	3.4987187687165804
According to conventional epidurographies and confirmed by CT scans, this feature is also seen regulary in cases with correct catheter position.	3.647402607279547
Small volumes of iopamidol spread preferentially into the wider parts of the epidural space between the gaps of the vertebral arcs, whereas the dura mater and periosteal layers touch at the inner side of the pedicules and laminae, allowing the existence of only a potential epidural space.	3.4918135114893523
This rhythmic widening and narrowing of the epidural space is the explanation of the "railroad track" in AP contrast epidurographies.	3.189781095664308
CT epidurography is a valuable tool to provide better insight into the morphology of the epidural space when filled with fluid (contrast medium, local anaesthetics), complementing findings using epiduroscopy and anatomic specimens.	3.1453490820006307
It stands to reason that this time- and cost-expensive method can never replace conventional epidurographies, but can help to interpret them properly.	3.4499200574816453
A 71-year-old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft X-ray therapy (total dose 28 Gy, half dose depth 10.5-11.5 mm).	3.0966660309262646
5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed.	3.896496172072301
This unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy, presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens.	3.5545460908034303
In this case it is improbable that the pemphigus was induced by the radiotherapy, as has been reported on several occasions in the literature.	3.2204121469131515
However, this possibility cannot be entirely excluded.	2.727262964563968
A vascular etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been long debated.	3.3110394972155217
In order to search for an ischemic basis of PD we assessed the clinical symptomatology of a consecutive group of 60 PD patients and compaired their frequency of cerebrovascular risk factors, carotid atherosclerosis and ischemic brain lesions with age-matched groups of stroke patients and normals.	3.1787455048450526
There were 16 (27%) subjects with PD who also had symptoms of cerebrovascular disease.	3.1459301464569447
The frequencies of carotid stenoses, ischemic brain lesions and most of cerebrovascular risk factors seen in the latter group was comparable with those of stroke patients and significantly higher than in the investigational subsets of patients with "pure" PD and normals.	3.839025833203669
Only one (1.6%) individual with PD presented signs suggestive of an ischemic etiology of parkinsonism.	2.882693888869417
These findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease occurs in approximately one fourth of patients with PD, but seldomly is causally related.	3.6205464255991386
Neurological involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis.	4.532580183281342
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis.	3.4684288380078416
The MRI brain scans of 22 patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed, along with the clinical information provided in the request form.	3.3630606445459823
All patients had signs and symptoms referable to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement.	3.5556619592155316
A wide spectrum of MR findings was noted: periventricular and white matter lesions on T2 W spin echo images, mimicking multiple sclerosis (46%); multiple supratentorial and infratentorial brain lesions, mimicking metastases (36%); solitary intraaxial mass, mimicking high-grade astrocytoma (9%); solitary extraaxial mass, mimicking meningioma (5%); leptomeningeal enhancement (36%).	3.144243143598084
The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is often difficult, particularly so in patients who lack either pulmonary or systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis.	3.2079213102817024
MRI shows a wide spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with neurosarcoidosis.	3.2322561956142546
These findings, however, are not specific for sarcoidosis and one must consider appropriate clinical circumstances in arriving at the correct diagnosis.	3.4531858487392966
In selected cases with isolated brain involvement, meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required.	3.1471461008450197
In 1990, we first described the papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS).	2.5571490857924615
It is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever.	2.989993119123788
The skin  lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days.	2.9140146102795788
In more than half of the patients, an acute parvovirus B 19 infection has been proven.	3.915590481696746
In a few cases of PPGSS, other viral infections have been found, for example hepatitis B and measles.	3.7110289980830116
We report on a patient with PPGSS and review the literature.	2.764245841211454
Fungus-bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe Candida albicans infection.	3.2367366497042998
A newborn infant with VACTERL-association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after Candida albicans sepsis, and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure.	2.797992361173303
Following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin B via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly.	3.398159768972952
Discussion: Since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should include fungus balls.	3.5125814502889887
Interactional understanding in psychoanalysis, especially the concept of the 'third point', suggests that the development of insight, empathy and relationship are dimensions of one and the same triangulating process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding.	3.693875034158291
In this context the psychoanalytic method, here understood as working with resistance, transference and countertransference, does not only offer a route to cognition, but also to the formation of a conflict-solving, egostrengthening, and supportive relationship peculiar to psychoanalysis.	3.0371564171430676
This is exemplified by a case history.	3.510141620553322
The Dutch Supreme Court ruled that in exceptional instances, physician-assisted suicide might be justifiable for patients with unbearable mental suffering but no physical illness.	2.9810226542600953
A recent report shows that explicit requests for physician-assisted suicide are not uncommon in psychiatric practice in the Netherlands.	3.1562714356814654
Some of those requests were granted and their medical background was described.	2.990859659064941
Psychiatric consultation for medical patients who request physician-assisted suicide is relatively rare.	3.127203825911333
Pemphigus is a rare intraepidermal autoimmune bullous disease.	4.334532662088438
Two major variants, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), are distinguished.	3.1131353530118675
The aim of this study was to document the clinical and immunpathological findings in all pemphigus patients who were diagnosed in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Würzburg over the past 10 years.	3.6278690700689924
Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia.	3.93442127279951
Diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient's age have been proven to be important determinants.	4.507107927097911
The question of whether post-operative recumbency can reduce the risk of PDPH has not been answered uniformly.	3.814182052902453
And besides, some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures, for example, as to clear definition and exact documentation of post-operative immobilization.	3.423115461515142
Furthermore, fine-gauge needles (26G or more) have not been investigated yet.	3.3061400317161116
The first aim of our study was therefore to examine the role of recumbency in the prevention of PDPH under controlled conditions using thin needles.	3.663924748147384
Secondly, we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified, atraumatic tip (Whitacre and Atraucan) by comparing them to Quincke needles of identical diameter.	2.768333535686889
Most of the former investigators compared Quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on PDPH.	3.3913857653509547
Three characteristic developments in modern western societies usually are considered to be independent variables in the ethical discussion:...	3.299452217797093
Background: Neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system.	3.8194618224564194
The pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).	2.7283567439832854
Typical disorders with a SMP component are complex regional pain syndromes (reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia), traumatic neuralgias and herpes zoster.	2.8421371110571445
The tendency towards sphincter-preserving resection for distal rectal cancers has led to a revival of the technique of coloanal anastomosis (CAA) in recent years.	3.205009624576235
In order to improve functional results, creation of a colonic J-pouch in conjunction with a coloanal anastomosis (CPA) was proposed.	2.9378271186827956
Two different operation techniques exist: i) Double-stapling with the anastomosis close to the dentate line and ii) intersphincteric resection with the anastomosis located immediately at the dentate line.	2.9779327541564533
A long rectal remnant after double-stapling leads to urgency in 15 % of the patients due to stool retention in the atonic remnant.	3.308309797351838
No propulsive motility patterns were recorded from the pouch which is emptyed passively by upper colonic peristalsis.	2.8842270457602526
Therefore colonic pouches should be fashionned of descending colon and should not exceed a length of 6 cm in order to prevent stool fragmentation.	3.504897460476612
Under these conditions the average stool frequency is reduced from 2-6 /d after CAA to 1-3 /d after CPA.	3.484360862304831
This effect is maximal during the first postoperative months, but is still significant after 3 years.	3.73465029999198
Colonic pouch construction also leads, due to better blood supply and prevention of pelvic hematomas, to a significant decrease of the anastomotic insufficiency rate from 10,0 % after CAA to 5,4 % after CPA.	3.5957474732674304
Therefore creation of a colonic J-pouch should be combined with coloanal reconstruction if the oncologic situation allows a sphincter-preserving procedure.	2.707357135034518
Background: Workers in the construction industry carry an increased risk for head and neck cancer due to the high consumption of alcohol and tobacco plus exposure to occupational carcinogenic or co-carcinogenic agents.	3.4201083655209703
These latter substances include asbestos, tar products, metal dust, wood dust, cement dust and paints.	2.711823000258881
Presently, there are no well-defined standards for documentation of echocardiographic studies.	3.894402397611223
Nevertheless, standards are essential to provide comparability of data and to realize electronic communication, both essential for quality management in echocardiography.	3.4523873835467818
Embolia cutis medicamentosa (Nicolau Syndrom) is a very rare complication of intramuscular injections which presents with extensive necrosis of the injected skin area.	3.74973379816275
Intra-arterial and/or para-arterial injections after prior perforation of certain vessels are discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms.	3.59105851497955
We describe the occurrence of embolia cutis medicamentosa after intra-articular injections into the knee.	3.2980424619324133
In a 30-beds-unit of the Orthopedic University Clinic in Bochum for an example we studied the frequency of combined injection therapy with local anesthesia and chirotherapy in a one year period.	3.483595358014213
There have been done 191 injections into ileosacral joints as well as 28 injections into facett joints of the cervical spine and additionally 315 into facett joints of the lumbar spine.	3.3693521386683014
On the other side there have been done 122 chirotherapeutic maneuvers at cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine by senior doctors with education in manual medicine.	2.868219488998803
The injection therapy however was done in mean predilection sites of the patients suffering from cervical spine disorders or low back pain, the chirotherapy was done in other spine areas.	4.153536569861703
The growing number of doctors with an education in manual medicine seems to improve the chirotherapy of the mean pathology as well, but it is not able to reduce the number of local injection therapy.	4.011443745214318
In a retrospective case control study at the University of Frankfurt, Germany, 101 babies born to opiate-addicted mothers were identified from birth charts from 1988 to 1995.	3.1217120430413723
After birth, they developed a withdrawal syndrome (neonatal abstinence syndrome).	3.1649160542364907
Fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards.	3.26515169393816
The group of opiate-exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment (n=48) and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program (n=51).	3.0446558539650064
The methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight (2822 g) than children in the group without methadone (2471 g).	3.6303037609919664
The abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group (convulsions 47.1%) than in heroin-exposed babies without methadone treatment (convulsions 27.1%).	3.0625067123731475
Women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate-addicted women without methadone substitution.	2.9729829411634037
Moreover, they cared significantly better for their babies: 81.3% of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90.9% cared adequately.	2.8135010098682107
The data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate-exposed babies.	3.756838134301989
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease of high penetrance and variable expression.	3.652933356899088
Epidemiologic data on craniofacial manifestations are still lacking.	3.0433901145768045
Up until now 74 patients with NF1 have been treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Hamburg.	3.2985860979640633
Forty-two patients presented periorbital and orbital neurofibromas varying in extension and in the severity of findings of the affected site.	4.296637880497047
Surgical therapy is mainly based on tumour reduction, frequently combined with face-lifting.	2.8973421812099884
On the other hand, identification and preparation of diffuse infiltrating neurofibromas in the trigeminal nerve region are difficult and local recurrence must be expected.	2.7299458594687906
Objective: The revised Edwards-Duromedics valve was introduced onto the market in June 1990.	2.77632423418478
In September 1993, the producer changed the name of the valve to TEKNA, which is a low profile, bileaflet, mechanical prosthesis with a self-irrigating hinge mechanism.	3.5074504674162768
The results of a prospective follow-up study after valve replacement with this prosthesis are presented.	3.5740305149410254
A granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus.	4.782143134841942
We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient, who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.	3.1152691200270355
In the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found.	3.4872639264727177
Repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis, although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded.	3.557894172649088
After indicating the operative therapy, the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach.	3.946202553608119
The histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus (tumor of Abrikossoff).	3.2735757058269424
Since the tumor grade was unknown, our therapy seemed to be justified because of the low risk involved in minimally invasive operative procedures.	3.6379681740089858
There has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject, including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime, with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment.	4.053517519013487
The case is discussed with a review of the literature.	3.1776566107804602
This review deals with the differential diagnosis and treatment of critically ill neuromuscular patients.	3.214849913931259
Acute muscular weakness may be a sign of newly acquired neuromuscular disorders or of an exacerbation of a previously existing disease.	3.4693571416200677
Typical features of the more common neuromuscular conditions are presented and the problems of neurocritical care delineated.	3.939311680688014
The appropriate ancillary tests are presented.	3.0012457219012236
Psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years, but for severely ill patients, often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care, the situation remains unsatisfactory.	3.6827177026024303
Community-based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care.	3.4492232892172416
The quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined, and many patients end up in asylums or homeless shelters unable to provide for their psychiatric needs.	2.7025534641766096
Neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet.	3.411922675699198
A diagnostic scoring system, recently published by Ohmann et al.	3.008959057181706
in this journal, was validated by analyzing the clinicopathological data of a consecutive series of 2,359 patients, admitted for suspicion of acute appendicitis.	3.372131822474034
The results of the scoring system were compared to the results of clinical evaluation by junior (provisional) and senior surgeons (final clinical diagnosis).	3.2475711517340704
To assess the diagnostic ability of the score, the accuracy and positive predictive value were defined as the major diagnostic performance parameters; the rate of theoretical negative laparotomies and that of diagnostic errors served as the major procedural performance parameters.	3.958685095134187
Of 2,359 patients admitted for suspected acute appendicitis, 662 were proven to have acute appendicitis by histology, for a prevalence of 28 %.	3.5410766645893026
The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the provisional clinical diagnosis were 0.50, 0.94, 0.77, 0.83, and 0.82; 0.93, for the score 0.63, 0.93, 0.77, 0.86 and 0.84, and for the final clinical diagnosis 0.90, 0.94, 0.85, 0.96, and 0.93, respectively.	3.162866657034982
Of the main diagnostic performance parameter, the accuracy of the score was signifianctly better than that of provisional clinical diagnosis (P < 0.05, 2 test).	3.469750424202226
The score yielded a rate of negative appendecomies and laparotomies of 14.3 and 12.3 %.	3.0019182617327878
With respect to the rate of overlooked cases of acute apendicitis, the score demonstrated a superior performance, with only 6 cases missed (0.9 %).	3.3627969388577035
However, the number of patients with acute appendicitis, including those with perforated disease, who were not identified by the score, was almost four times that of the final clinical diagnosis (245 vs 63).	3.97297391659621
With regard to the main procedural performance parameter, the score resulted in a significantly smaller number of diagnostic errors than the provisional clinical investigator (P < 0.05, 2 test).	3.1203236562108305
The results of this study indicate that the diagnostic scoring system might be helpful when experienced investigators or additional diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography are not available.	3.4588703268220247
It may therefore be of value in the preclinical evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis and may be instrumental as a quality control tool and in clinical guidelines.	3.6214756126795904
Purpose: The standards and regulations concerning the protection of patients and operator staff within the context of MRI are compiled.	3.627832572498042
Resulting consequences regarding physical parameters are evaluated.	3.1457506364354684
Replacement of the tracheal conduit remains an unresolved problem.	3.184775274087453
The microporous material expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) is suitable for tracheal reconstruction.	3.2036945055300965
The aim of our study was to improve the limited mechanical properties of this material by incorporating reinforcement elements and to examine the influence of these elements on host incorporation and epithelialization.	3.5147721630432778
In so dours ePTFE prostheses were reinforced with Ionomer cement and porous high density polyethylene (pHDPE) rings and implanted into the neck muscle of miniature pigs.	2.6474014342750207
One of these prostheses was epithelialized by a cell seeding technique and was thus placed into a tracheal defect.	2.83466766246111
Results were examined grossly by endoscopy and than by light and scanning electron microscopy.	2.9876545326975865
The shapes of both types of prostheses showed a high stability.	3.5167399486471718
In vivo interposition of an incorporated and epithelialized prosthesis to a host led to cell differentiation.	2.794911879326867
The improved biomechanical properties of the prostheses waid and the reproducible formation of epitheliums are important advances in the solution of effectively correcting tracheal defects.	3.1976912403793643
Primary infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7) during early childhood causes permanent latent infection, usually without any ill effects; only a small percentage of primary infections will lead to exanthem subitum.	3.0527288782741238
Like other herpesviruses, HHV-6 and HHV-7 can be reactivated at any time if host defence mechanisms become defective (e.g.	2.6578592499320615
in transplant recipients, AIDS, tumour patients).	3.2383330382982605
HHV-6 can be reactivated under such conditions and cause a variety of clinical problems, such as exanthems along with interstitial pneumonia or hepatitis for example.	3.794741554171564
In addition, the reactivated virus may influence the course of autoimmune and proliferative diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Hodgkin's disease.	3.1123914584490953
While, HHV-7 may be associated with similar disorders, more systematic studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both viruses.	3.446978795547411
Despite its widespread use there is no clear evidence that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by this approach.	3.9834964914189444
In contrast, it has been suggested that PAC might increase mortality.	3.1296798479638177
Available data do not allow the definitive omission of PAC in medical intensive care, nor do they justify its widespread use.	3.2860876265967325
Open questions on the influence of PAC on outcome variables in critically ill patients have to be answered by conducting randomized controlled trials.	4.21810071652183
Beforehand, knowledge about PAC has to be improved.	4.081428799418408
As a consequence, PAC should be performed whenever a specific hemodynamic question arises that cannot be answered by clinical judgement or by less invasive means.	3.2014188191146826
It is important that the investigator be experienced in catheter placement and data interpretation to avoid harm to these critically ill patients.	2.627874649052829
A long-term goal of assisted reproduction techniques should be the development of methods which are able to replace the high-dose stimulation with gonadotropins in order to limit the costs and risks of in vitro fertilization treatment.	4.494399498613499
The in vitro maturation of immature oocytes derived from follicular aspirates and the in vitro growth of early follicles isolated from ovary biopsies are discussed as possible alternatives.	3.086205819292479
Both methods are able to shift the application of stimulating hormones from the in vivo to an in vitro level, but are today still far away from being established in clinical routine.	3.5658301720919536
The exact knowledge of the topographic anatomy of the urethra as well as the macro- and microcirculation of the penis [6] are the basics of reconstructive urethral surgery.	3.611187851092688
Adherence to the fundamentals and principles of tissue transfer [5] are necessary to fascilitate conditions for successful treatment of the various disorders of the male urethra.	4.124312310926012
Mutural description of the anatomy of the male urethra in conjunction with external male genitals is necessary because of developmental similarities as well as the close anatomical relationship.	3.8682480402942163
The arterial and venous blood supply of the urethra and the penis have to be taken into account if vascularized flaps from the penile skin or the prepuce are used in urethral reconstruction.	3.567172383198032
The dual arterial and venous vascularity of the genital skin is of fundamental importance to a successful outcome of the operative treatment.	3.8951185107730804
The purpose of this article is, to summarize the relevant anatomical knowledge of reconstructive urethral surgery.	2.699269230501023
In this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas, the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint, is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium-term outcome in 40 patients treated conservatively and 72 patients treated surgically by arthroscopy.	3.6019525699889443
The criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis.	3.5433123285269184
The stages on MRI follow the morphology of the interface, i.e., the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone, on T1- and T2-weighted images.	2.727120556221308
After 18 and 24 months there were no substantial differences visible on MRI between the two different treatment groups.	3.744658617366149
In fact, in the majority of cases  (> 60%) the MRI result was the same in spite of the treatment that had been carried out.	4.209130452566808
Arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a reintegration in the sense of upgrading on the MRI (36% to 30%); nevertheless, a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases (4%).	4.085707462721827
In both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis, juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms.	3.556227379815747
The number of women with congenital cardiac disease, who mature into adulthood is increasing.	3.048025468215911
Unfortunately, there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients.	3.5138817817281747
Most women with congenital cardiac disease can safely use oral contracetives, especially low-estrogen combination or progestin-only preparations, with the exception of those, who are at particular risk because of thrombembolic complications (especially in cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger reaction, rhythm disturbances), fluid retention (especially in reduced ventricular function and congestive heart failure), arterial hypertension (important in coarctation), infectious complications (endocarditis) or hyperlipidemia.	3.0642115904179703
Oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events.	4.332990761954424
Intrauterine devices are very effective, have no metabolic side effects and merely cary a small risk of endocarditis.	3.3577995690539826
Newer devices containing progesterone only may put the patients at a still smaller risk.	3.218279937957883
Contraceptive subdermal implants (e.g.	2.9634629112996453
levonorgestrel) are used with good results in the United States for patients with contraindications to estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and may well become more widely accepted in patients in Germany in the coming years.	3.8778742781158564
Barrier methods can be used, but have a higher failure rate, which may be inacceptable in patients at risk (e.g.	3.7977914990520847
Especially in Eisenmenger's, permanent sterilisation should be advised.	2.7124340055514065
Two groups of 15 patients each with disseminated intravascular coagulation in association with septic disease were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin  (lmw-heparin) in different dosages (group I: 1,5-5 IE/kg body weight (BW) per hour; group II: 8-15 IE/kg BW).	3.6709363680220077
We studied the levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PTF), and global tests of coagulation like prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), thrombin time (TT) and platelet count, plasminogen activation (PA) and fibrinogen concentration to estimate the success of heparin therapy in the two groups.	3.172734434448416
TT and fibrinogen concentration were not suitable to follow the course of the coagulation disorder.	4.244994921621763
PT, PTT, platelet count progressively PA, D-dimer, TAT, and PTF normalised progressively after heparinisation.	2.6753119913478463
However, only the last three parameters were sensitive enough to show different effects of variable dosages of lmw-heparin.	2.971960625757774
D-dimer, TAT, and PTF levels declined in proportion with heparin concentrations, and thus appear to be the most useful parameters for monitoring the therapeutic effect of heparin in septic coagulopathies.	3.3679571926674
In patients with acute or chronic myocarditis, arrhythmias are a common and often the only clinical symptom in the natural course of the disease.	3.4132189728476874
The potentially malignant tachy- and bradyarrhythmias are of particular significance in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac death in myocarditis.	3.446907298482346
Factors responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias are structural changes, parameters of ventricular dynamics and vascular changes.	3.413352636618117
Fibrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue and secondary hypertrophy and atrophy of the myocytes favor the development of ectopic pacemakers, late potentials and reentry as a result of inhomogeneous stimulus conduction.	3.5985795719406735
Furthermore, parameters of ventricular dynamics such as increased wall tension, increased myocardial oxygen consumption and diminished coronary reserve in the case of disturbed systolic or diastolic left ventricular function also contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmias.	3.2495216340464967
Lastly, vascular factors can further increase the arrhythmogenicity of the inflamed myocardium through the disturbance of micro- and macrovascular perfusion and the resulting myocardial ischemia.	3.258605063165053
Non-invasive rhythmological evaluation by 24 h Holter ECG, measurement of ventricular late potentials and heart rate variability can be used for orienting risk stratification of the at-risk patient with myocarditis.	3.6253498187806747
Programmed atrial and ventricular electrophysiological stimulation also has a relatively high predictive value for spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	3.861262064375293
It should be emphasized that, at the present time, optimal electrophysiological parameters with a high predictive value do not exist.	3.209829552380302
In a selected patient population, immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy can lead to the reduction or complete suppression of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias.	3.5743567537865713
Nevertheless, in the interim, further precautionary antiarrhythmic measures such as serial antiarrhythmic treatment, VT ablation and AICD implantation are necessary in patients with malignant cardiac arrhythmias.	3.4803743112125174
Right ventricular myocardial biopsy for demonstration or exclusion of myocarditis is an important additional examination which can improve the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias of unclear etiology.	4.182914476853274
Material and methods: Autografts (4 mm) of the left common carotid artery in 20 Wistar rats were harvested up to 4 weeks after surgery.	3.6184707312155355
The specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of collagen III and IV.	3.2822191473626914
Results: The demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture.	3.7834000593689696
In the intima, the organisation and amount of collagen IV was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments.	3.367548664344465
The media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for regenerating the continuity break.	2.927205602028557
The adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis, in which collagen III and IV-positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion.	3.255723472320114
The marked myointimal hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was made up of collagen-positive extracellular matrix.	3.6884848207880996
Conclusions: Our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery.	3.0397398938722797
The identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery.	3.0102847578820846
We treated 8123 patients with invasive malignant melanoma were treated up to 1995.	2.976660772757486
2200 had invasive melanomas with less than 0.75 mm Breslow thickness; of these, 45 developed metastases.	3.388742816924459
Three had second primary tumors with greater thickness.	3.367518443681182
One case showed metastasis from another tumor.	2.9634746423525993
In two cases the metastases were not ascertained histologically.	3.258964208339552
The remaining 39 cases showed some peculiarities: a greater proportion of late and of internal (as contrasted to regional) metastases.	2.888244891374395
Most of these primary tumors had a Breslow thickness of more than 0.5 mm and were Clark level III or even IV.	2.995439862739024
Male patients and primary tumor sites in the area of head and neck were significantly over-represented.	4.048074378443438
In this paper the question is considered to what extent the patient's and analyst's perception and tolerance of both aggressive and destructive elements of the analytic relationship can be increased.	3.311298163926312
Successful interpretation enables the patient to feel, enact and comprehend animosity in the transference and experience that the relationship can continue.	3.1768496020057264
The concept of primary aggression developed in Freud's speculation on death instinct is discussed in its clinical function of relief.	2.877359263372743
The metapsychological concept of primary aggression facilitates work on aggressive and especially destructive developments of the relationship.	3.166068873680623
Freud's and subsequently Eissler's examination of the reciprocity of destructiveness and narcissism opened plausible clinical avenues to explain the compensation of defence mechanisms against mankind's vulnerability in the face of mortality.	3.0760907946190255
The concept of primary aggression is obviously of greater relevance than frustration/aggression models since the former does not view the patient as mere victim of his biography, but as a subject with the potential to enact his own destructiveness.	2.80248058652192
Since aggressiveness is often concomitant with fear and suppressed guilt, interpretation plays a decisive role in relieving the superego strain; more confrontation may involve the analyst in the role of the persecutor.	2.8599984485077883
Sudden and violent feelings of hate towards the analyst require careful treatment of the patient's irritation.	3.8022810714918935
Interpretation of genetic causes of animosity often prove to be countertransference resistance; interpretation in transference, however, is viewed as profitable.	3.117836714900324
Finally, those dangerous and destructive phases of treatments are discussed, which compel the analyst to protect the setting.	3.3952204840093643
Young infants, especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency, are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe RSV disease.	3.176244196200505
Specific therapeutic options for RSV are limited.	3.448805091169422
In this prospective study we investigated the efficacy of microcatheter spinal anaesthesia in comparison with a combined spinal-epidural technique in trauma patients.	3.8322110245567407
Background: In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy, the OPHTEL project combines clinical centers of ophthalmology and internal medicine, an institute for medical informatics and health services research, a publishing company and different industrial partners in the EDP market.	2.7684338501218586
Purpose: A prospective study was initiated for the correlation of the findings in the initial cranial CT with the long-term follow-up MRI in children with severe head injury.	4.086151286253874
Another aim was the evaluation of frequency and location of lesions, found only in MRI.	4.068724919806117
A differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis, patient information on avoidance of known dangers, and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected.	3.6615512466770115
Information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time, which generally means on the day before the operation.	3.2960386106054935
An exception is made to this rule for day surgery.	3.2295182455609353
The patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind.	3.699458381866959
Such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions.	4.034040778216601
In the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information [and making decisions].	3.0478010854046285
In the case of unconscious patients everything depends on "presumable consent to the operation".	2.9401748099132403
If a patient later cites lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be unwise to refuse an operation, she must elaborate plausible grounds for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information.	2.7332946393740642
Within the last few years the use of Point-of-Care Analyzers increased.	3.9717476783206593
These testing is primarily performed in the emergency room, intensive care units, and in the operating room using small portable analyzers.	4.653389514748681
The fact of being transportable and working with rechargeable or changable batteries and disposable cartridges caused us to use blood gas analysis in the prehospital setting.	2.7892531611966853
Patients undergoing major vascular surgery frequently require a substantial intraoperative fluid replacement to assure hemodynamic stability, which is in excess of the expected fluid requirements due to starving, blood and insensible losses.	3.1094952107687863
This leads to a positive fluid balance which can not be readily explained.	3.9139891691989406
The case of a 57 year old patient is reported, who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum CK and CKMB values of 821 and 84 U/l, respectively.	3.8597729859811296
The patient underwent bicycle exercise testing 9 days after a myocardial infarction in 25 W steps every 2 min starting with 50 W. The ergometry was interrupted at 125 W because of ST segment depression of 0.28 mV in V6.	2.8438007309534896
Systolic blood pressure dropped to 55 mm Hg, combined with severe angina and shock.	3.7648503255929335
Volume substitution and catecholamines did not elevate blood pressure.	3.1078541956226218
Immediate M-mode and Doppler echo revealed a "stiletto"-shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency.	3.0876163277894295
The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium, diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture.	3.357516348880638
Despite of shock, mitral valve replacement was performed successfully.	3.3673042182897297
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction.	2.490820557393014
The flow directed balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter introduced by Swann and Ganz 1970 has made possible the measurement of filling pressures in the heart and is extensively used in operating rooms, in catheterization laboratories and in intensive care units.	3.0382698342300283
The rupture of the pulmonary artery is an uncommon complication associated with a high mortality rate exceeding 50 percent.	4.2917050834484565
Main symptoms are cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea and cardiac shock.	2.9765932950646623
Complications occur if guidelines for the safe use of the balloon-tipped catheters are not strictly followed: Excessive catheter manipulation, advancing the catheter tip too far peripherally and leaving the inflated balloon in the wedge position for long periods should be avoided.	3.082452297987878
Patients with pulmonary hypertension as well as elderly and anticoagulated patients are at greater risk.	3.9787905277879454
On 90 patients with 93 unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may 1996 and april 1998, in 46 patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed.	3.539823159400066
The diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining costal base.	3.2427391063405184
After partial corporectomy and discectomy, a tricortical bone graft has been inserted.	3.081127599152014
An additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system.	3.857494214116789
The incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal endostapler.	3.3078361767598925
Controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by X-ray and CT-scan.	4.035030636036755
There was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection.	3.1645148903565463
Splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures.	3.777935159944141
This is a report of an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment of stroke, combining a stroke unit and rehabilitation in one clinic.	3.652426301004959
Mean age of 559 patients was 68.7 years (median 70 years).	3.0240410012364403
25% of patients had an initial Barthel index of <30, 20% presented with TIA's and PRIND's.	3.340454280179676
9% suffered from cerebral hemorrhage.	3.2756231370352205
The one month mortality was 6.7%, one year mortality 18.3%.	3.324131397968608
Discharge to a nursing home was necessary in 5.4%.	3.7474197226941017
Overall more than 90% of our patients have been treated continuously in our clinic.	4.721536222860968
Combining modern diagnostics with early onset rehabilitation seem advantageous.	3.326110438395208
About 220 knee endoprostheses are implanted at our clinic annually.	3.281155698548779
Practice has shown, however, that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments, implants, operating room staff, and surgical planning causes problems.	3.627218043148489
As a result of this, a prophylactic search for sources of error began (risk management).	3.0789635298352858
If the sources of error are found, described, and remedied, knee endoprosthetic surgery will be successful for both the patient and the surgical team.	3.7934489496389747
Cooperation and communication among manufacturer, surgeon, and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks.	3.425795353055496
The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since viable pathogen has been recovered from plaques.	2.848230540694146
Chlamydiae are epithelial pathogens notorious for causing persistent infection.	3.021131325508962
Atherosclerosis, however, is a chronic inflammatory disease involving mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall.	4.313065909179292
A bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the resident mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously.	2.8492897180255827
Besides medical and sociodemographic data, two personality factors - self-efficacy and locus of control - were found to predict postoperative pain.	3.5090686558963458
Self-efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully execute the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes.	3.072235643402399
Locus of control, in the extreme case, is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action, versus an external orientation, in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate.	3.3542766721525754
We postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them.	3.5187819735015595
At present there is neither an completely inert biomaterial available, nor does a universal test exist which objectively evaluates biocompatibility.	2.7448769679206437
One reason is the individuality of the host, especially with regard to the inflammatory response.	3.9572383333415053
Inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto-oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation.	3.1764045431501295
The present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen-impregnated polyester prosthesis (Dacron) in Balb/c mice on experimental days 1, 18, 38, and 322.	3.066012151785148
Serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target.	3.690837527541619
Specific polymer antibodies, enhanced by repeated implantations, could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day 322.	3.3634996652776317
These antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating.	3.4795055055241595
The antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete Freund's adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day 1.	3.2747766647350374
Results suggest that specific polymer antibodies, reflecting an inflammatory response, might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses.	3.274725081308785
Twenty-nine unicondylar fractures of the distal femur were treated at the Trauma Center "Bergmannsheil", University of Bochum, Germany, between 1981 and 1994.	3.650845096705243
All patients sustained their injuries from severe direct trauma.	2.9991256904350094
There were 16 lateral condylar fractures, 7 medial condylar fractures and 6 tangential posterior ("Hoffa-type") fractures.	2.8193185614070093
Twenty-eight closed injuries and 1 grade IIIB open fracture were included.	2.9625174938701155
Eleven patients sustained concomitant injuries to the skeleton.	3.3837161751809615
All fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with screws within 8 h of admission.	3.282054119786023
Postoperative management consisted of early continuous passive motion and minimal weight-bearing for 6-8 weeks, progressing to full weight-bearing.	3.4573073562514565
The mean follow-up was 68 months (18-120).	3.317568882707623
The therapeutic outcome (clinical result, radiographs) was rated by the Neer score.	3.0680424478881334
Twenty-seven patients were available for follow-up examination.	3.7979900688791206
Of these, 23 were rated as excellent.	3.1992212434583918
3 achieved satisfactory results, and 1 had an unsatisfactory result.	3.9085442018194345
All patients who did not achieve an excellent outcome had had accompanying injuries.	3.072945697079911
Open reduction and internal screw fixation of unicondylar femur fractures provided overall excellent long-term results.	3.16009901816015
The therapeutic outcome was significantly affected by associated injuries of the skeleton.	3.4165709305265057
The realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients, but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients.	3.683329498023248
The global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems; stepwise mastering of these problems may help to maintain or restore an acceptably high quality of life according to the WHO guidelines for palliative medicine.	3.4515663651786483
Together, this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed.	3.269623508006488
We report on 16 patients who received 18 liver grafts and were followed up for at least 2 years.	3.3523263979429485
In 7 patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.	3.597562900097693
The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 87.5 % compared to 85.3 % in all other 710 orthotopic liver transplantations performed from September 1988 to December 1995 at our institution.	3.0349262824603316
Anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin.	3.2822418351388207
Three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis, one patient for 1 week only early after the transplantation.	3.201803976707899
Two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy.	3.248576851049126
Two patients had to be retransplanted, one for thrombosis of the hepatic artery and portal vein after discontinuation of dicoumarin due to GI bleeding and one for hepatic vein thrombosis after insufficient dicoumarin intake.	3.284192286130467
Terminal BCS represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation; however, life-long, closely monitored anticoagulation is essential.	3.0520320281437243
Postmenopausal estrogen-replacement therapy maintains bone density as assessed by densitometry of skeletal sites relevant for future fracture.	3.012383153698931
Optimal doses are 2 mg oral estradiol, 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens, 1.25 mg estrone and 50 µg transdermal estradiol.	2.743944774065255
There is a role for calcium supplementation in individuals with non-optimal dietary intake of calcium.	3.188603028939576
Observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement reduces the future risk for hip fracture by 25 %.	3.5398252516071724
Discontinuation of replacements is associated with an increase of fracture risk few years later.	4.0321383189530575
It is noteworthy that there is a lack of formal fracture studies providing data on the efficacy of estrogen replacement for primary prevention of osteoporosis and for secondary prevention in terms of treatment of women with established osteoporosis, with a diagnosis based on WHO criteria.	3.9413246114028953
Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and tibolone, a synthetic steroid with weak estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic properties, may constitute alternatives to estrogen-replacement therapy.	2.891006193515709
Raloxifenen maintains bone density in and reduces vetebral fractures by some 50 % in women with prevalent osteoporosis.	3.2901794561920146
Artificial insemination from donor (heterologous insemination) is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility.	3.3923069172100657
In this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors, the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized.	3.1734107836586456
Although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy, most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not-identifiable information on biological and social characteristics.	3.008946425043303
Semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population.	3.8817053085947744
The decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples.	2.847752798074978
Retrospectively, however, the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership.	4.0773406730033015
The most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children.	2.9250931945622076
The course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural procreation.	3.631644357754394
They receive more love and care than "usual" children.	2.98765022960119
Their rights concerning the insemination, however, are poorly considered.	3.7464510352822504
If we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights, non-disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems.	3.153662453492119
The extended field of view imaging procedure named "SieScape" provides, for the first time, a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to 60 cm in length.	3.0673704175087884
This allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view, without having to assemble several pictures.	3.702484754278757
Furthermore, pathological find-ings can be shown in full size in their surroundings.	2.9600955255740105
This method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding, for instance a tumor, during therapy.	3.2587680113593867
Heart rate variability (HrV) has been established as an important risk parameter in patients surviving myocardial infaction.	3.764300683507187
Recently, analysis of HRV - particularly of the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) - from short term ECG recordings has been proposed as an alternative to that from 24 hour Holter monitorings.	3.1854497639250052
The present study is the first to compare SDNN from short term recordings to that from 24 hour recordings with respect to risk stratification after myocardial infarction.	3.471978314592409
In 60 patients at the time of discharge from the hospital, SDNN from Holter monitoring averaged 93  +/-  30 ms compared to 39  +/-  18 determined from short term recordings.	3.714237955983358
Patients with a prospectively defined clinical endpoint differed significantly from those with an uneventful course with respect to age, left ventricular ejection fraction, mean RR interval from Holter recording ( 753  +/-  153 vs 921  +/-  132 ms), mean RR from short term recording (783  +/-  153 vs 914  +/-  163 ms), and SDNN from the Holter recording (71  +/-  27 vs 97  +/-  29 ms; p < 0.001) However, patients with and without clinical event could not be seperated by means of SDNN measured from short term ECG registrations (35  +/-  22 vs 41  +/-  19 ms; P = NS).	3.3158756935758915
Thus, SDNN measured from short term ECG recordings does not seem to be useful regarding risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction.	3.0841642257253308
Analysis of HRV should be performed using 24 hour Holter monitoring, which provides more information and reflects circadian fluctuation in autonomic tone.	3.348542206825052
Glomus tumors (glomangiomata) are benign tumors arising from glomus cells.	3.2033287286658076
Multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant, which is usually located subungually.	3.779591607069543
Nonetheless multiple glomangiomata - sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature - may cause considerable discomfort.	3.271452881954017
Treatment of multiple glomangiomata is problematic because of the often large number of tumors.	4.021548697814851
Sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and cryosurgical therapy.	3.855151120061523
We report on sclerotherapy in a 35 year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors.	3.0694436765697226
Conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass (LVM) are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning.	3.2428978898102843
Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of LVM.	3.2926279974683643
This study was performed to compare LVM measurement by one- (1D), two- (2D), and 3D echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients (pts) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).	3.49461302128519
Determination of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) can be performed through washout methods, indicator gas dilution or bodyplethysmography.	3.0757542189453475
Some of these techniques have been adapted for use in intensive care patients whilst being mechanically ventilated.	4.090657183218885
However, most measurement setups are bulky, cumbersome to use and their running costs are high.	2.839406352954317
Hence FRC measurement has not become a routine method in intensive care although it offers considerable advantages in the management of ventilated  patients such as the determination of "best PEEP", the detection of progressive alveolar collapse in the course of acute lung injury and during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	3.8377054829692283
Up to now most efforts to improve and simplify FRC measurement were made at the expense of accuracy.	2.8040152689065385
An ideal method ought to be accurate, easy to handle and cost-effective.	3.330147375739642
It should supply not only FRC data but also information about intrapulmonary gas distribution and dead space.	2.8952584945139495
These demands can be met using modern data acquisition software.	3.1652122312306945
The pros and cons of all methods available for FRC measurement are discussed in view of their suitability for intensive care patients.	3.820582265882348
A conventional nitrogen washout using emission spectroscopy for measurement of nitrogen concentration gives satisfying exact values for the determination  of the parameters mentioned above.	3.3029441814135
The measurement error can be lowered under 5% by special corrections for flow and  nitrogen signal (delay and rise times, changes of gas viscosity).	2.79616404604472
For flow measurement a normal pneumotachograph can be used.	4.065855051538166
Using a laptop computer for data  acquisition the bed-side monitor fulfills most of the demands in intensive care.	3.178897689663147
It is then also possible to measure indices of intrapulmonary gas distribution such as Alveolar Mixing Efficiency and Lung Clearance Index.	2.7344584716208606
Three strategies are followed in handling the key issue within the field of action of care and services for the elderly: securing the material needs of those requiring care, creating appropriate care structures, and providing an effective counselling back-up to alleviate interface problems.	3.3002593429962217
Thouse latter, process-oriented aids, have been the subject of discussion and further development under the key term of case management for a good decade.	4.016685715486606
The aim in this context is to prevent the elderly from being unnecessarily moved into residential care, to stop the revolving door syndrome, to ensure that older people can stay in their homes, to support family members acting as care providers, to enhance the quality of services and those to ease the strain on fund providers.	3.133023284123236
In the context of case managment, these diverse tasks are performed by three basic substantive functions: the gatekeeper, broker, and advocacy functions.	2.792723652348197
Each of these three functions characterizes the main variants of case management with a different weighting (care management, community care, managed care and case management as a counselling approach with a particular focus on individual help).	3.147761225594629
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly; it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin.	3.9584303811112855
Several clinical variants of BP have been described, and we now add our observations of two BP cases mimicking subacute prurigo.	3.0966991156223043
Both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic excoriated papules for several months before presentation.	3.169997223208031
Blisters had never developed and did not occur during follow up.	4.26957291454021
Histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis.	3.437623716521214
In the serum of both patients, indirect immunofluorescence on NaCl-separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters.	3.4951825327895323
Perilesional skin biopsies showed linear IgG or C3 deposits in the basement membran zone.	3.125430441055893
Immunoblotting of epidermal and dermal extracts demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230-kD protein, which is the known major bullous pemphigoid antigen.	3.2378426294325364
These cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid.	4.49925196817615
The distal metatarsal osteotomy according to Magerl allows correction of a hallux valgus deformity by lateral and plantar displacement as well as by pronation and varisation.	3.280589901607336
The length of the first metatarsal can be adjusted by the depth of the cut at the resection or by a slightly oblique osteotomy.	3.4670247648554966
If necessary, soft tissue release and/or a osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx can be done to relocate the sesamoids under the head of the first metatarsal.	4.3159518667940056
A review of 118 foot operations in 75 patients demonstrated a very good or good result in about 75 %.	3.2258968634326006
Radiological examination showed sufficient lateralisation of the metatarsal head.	3.1039709834843183
Evaluating the length of the first metatarsal and the amount of variation, the results were less satisfying.	4.901538078438219
The metatarsophalangeal angles could be corrected by 14  ° and the intermetatarsal angles by 7  ° on average.	3.024588559969253
The sophisticated operative procedure limits the use of this technique as a standard procedure.	4.625570394274739
The contribution of Rudolf Virchow to dermatology seems to have been forgotten, or present-day dermatologists are not aware of it.	3.0693370271424776
The present historical review is intended to show that Virchow's thoughts and the terminology created by him are still alive.	3.1177607713400937
The report encompasses a short biography, including Virchow's nonmedical activities.	2.865580632807741
It starts with early experimental publications, which laid to the foundation for his fame, and with dermatological studies of his early period.	3.087223282355947
This is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work, "Cellularpathologie".	2.77512302087617
Special mention is made of Virchow's lasting contributions to medical, and particularly dermatological, terminology.	3.2009598681103846
Finally, his historical studies, his latter small publications on topics in dermatology, his pupils and scientific friends, and the social-political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed.	3.0270108059729695
Thus, a multifaceted picture is painted of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways.	2.71732806732395
Starter's pistols are often bought for self-defense, but can also be used for criminal activities (e.g.	3.3365307073421975
assaults, etc.).	3.1009574187948172
When a starter's pistol is loaded with blank cartridges and is fired, a powerful shooting noise results.	2.6938475665620985
The level of the noise produced is high enough to cause acoustic trauma.	3.3201083923218477
For legal examinations and giving an expert opinion further information is needed about the power of such noise.	3.2227726428752925
We examined how high peak sound pressure levels were of the gunshots of blank cartridges and whether there existed any directional characteristics from the noise emissions.	2.8576560408663547
In all, 15 different models of starter's pistols of 8 different calibres were examined.	2.6884726180757617
Four transducers were situated in the horizontal plane around the muzzle: 0 ° (shooting direction), 45 °, 90 °, and 180 ° (towards the firer).	3.0550717362221773
The distances between the transducers and the muzzle were 25 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm.	3.1933024334482205
At a distance of 1 m and in the 0 ° shooting direction the peak sound pressure levels of nearly all weapons tested exceeded 160 dB.	3.21746354201115
At a shooting distance of 25 cm the peak sound pressure levels reached 181 dB.	2.9282464116667706
In addition, we observed a directional characteristic concerning the emission of noise: pistols produced higher peak sound pressure levels to the front than backwards towards the firer.	2.6992102825920785
Owing to their rare incidence, foreign body injuries in the region of the orbit, skull base and skull have up to now mostly been treated in  the literature by means of case reports.	4.377498385427835
Here we present our experience and treatment regimen for ten patients we have treated during the last 3 years.	3.9986098094969025
In seven cases the foreign body was located in the orbit alone, whereas in three others the orbit and the frontal base were equally involved.	3.332763993238539
Except for one case, the foreign material could be removed completely.	3.8933190491333356
Three patients suffered from partial or complete loss of vision and one patient developed a psychosyndrome during the follow-up period, but no late effects were registered in the remaining six cases.	3.973852966367873
Before removing the foreign body and carefully reconstructing the accident, however, we strongly recommend the documentation of possible functional deficits, preferably by means of photography.	4.143475100793161
CT is the method of choice for localising the foreign body, except for the depiction of wood particles.	3.5732314983534144
Here, sonography and MR should be performed.	3.241460354299533
As the therapeutic approach, the cooperation of an interdisciplinary team of ophthalmogists, neuro- and maxillofacial surgeons seems mandatory.	3.343204436480703
To avoid inflammation, the immediate removal of the foreign material is recommended in cases with considerable intracranial lesions: post-operative neurologic and intensive care monitoring should be provided.	4.0194098096141335
Treatment is completed by high-dose antibiotics, using CSF-soluble substances and, if necessary, anti-convulsives.	3.7905758335892856
Rocuronium is a new nondepolarizing muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described.	3.932691969261951
The goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery.	2.7354260542981996
These operations, which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to "share" the patient's airway, require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments.	3.1914955056810963
In addition, the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed.	3.892255759627697
Patients and methods: In order to better define the potential advantages and risks of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), we designed a prospective study including 73 eyes.	3.5445510427927993
Treatment of tachycardic atrial fibrillation (AF) is difficult in patients with congestive heart failure because many drugs which exert negative dromotropic effects (beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists) may depress ventricular contractility and/or decrease arterial blood pressure.	3.3103006235566537
We have identified 2 intravascular sites in the superior (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) where parasympathetic nerves, which innervate the atrioventricular node, can be stimulated electrically.	3.134633682830179
In 8 dogs, a 7-F catheter with an expandable electrode basket at its tip was non-fluoroscopically positioned in the SVC and in the proximal IVC (time for positioning: 3-5 minutes).	3.452956845990866
High-frequency electrical parasympathetic stimulation (PS) with 20 Hz at an impulse duration of 0.1 ms was performed during pacing induced AF.	2.797394052922423
Results: With increasing stimulus strength, a graded ventricular rate slowing was observed during PS in the SVC and IVC (P<0.01, ANOVA).	2.997183772013283
The negative dromotropic effect started instantaneously after onset of PS and ceased immediately after termination of PS.	3.0308828917047776
During ventricular pacing at a constant rate, no decrease of the arterial blood pressure was observed during PS.	4.208104583911238
PS in the IVC yielded significantly lower stimulation thresholds than in the SVC.	3.9989535203909217
Conclusions: Transvenous parasympathetic stimulation for ventricular rate control during AF can easily be achieved in the SVC and IVC in dogs.	3.305790900921552
If the results translate to patients, PS may be very beneficial in the treatment of AF in patients with congestive heart failure.	3.5118749468351713
A total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months (12-98).	3.7472604893922186
Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively.	3.4275510428094536
According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting.	3.9805519421326987
The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program.	3.2831759308459625
All fractures in the conservative group were of type A.	4.387669806902783
Charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage 4 of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) which is known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease since 1886.	3.062249963912202
This entity, which can be subdivided into 3 groups including subgroups, predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly.	3.3552404829819586
The first symptom, often unnoticed by the patient for a long period, is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer-toe formation and mobile pes cavus.	3.5820422813623845
Progredient atrophy of the peroneal, extensor, tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus excavatus with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot, secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment.	3.3903257289237425
Permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive microtrauma (stage 5 of HMSN).	3.6277181282497235
The alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal architectur is imitated by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells.	3.8544449811027626
The first description, based on six cases, was published in 1986 by Yousem and Hochholzer.	3.192213689406074
We investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung immunhistochemical by means of antibodies against apoprotein B and C of human surfactant.	3.586566299656962
Both the lining cells and the macrophages in the alveolar-like spaces were stained.	3.541140457570996
The septal connection tissue cells did not react.	3.0490446904791404
These findings confirm the expression of surfactant constituants and, hence, the differentiation into type II pneumocytes of the epithelial cells of the alveolar adenoma.	3.610701890949239
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women, whereas it is rare in men.	4.314784929611425
In our own case series the ratio is 175 : 1.	3.260449965440297
The present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of 54 de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from 1978 to 1996 and a comparative discussion of 528 female breast cancers from the same geographic area.	3.276777686286417
Patients with congenital varicella syndrome develop cicatricial skin lesions and microphthalmia.	3.066330912331201
An overlap in the clinical manifestations exist with a specific genetic disorder, called MIDAS syndrome.	3.5512975221823777
It is due to a partial deletion of the short arm from chromosome X, with consecutive monosomy Xp22.3.	3.6812746691387535
The rapid development of recombinant DNA technology and our enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of human disease has facilitated the development of new molecular therapeutic modalities, termed gene therapy.	3.4216801583590435
Gene therapy involves the transfer of functional genes into somatic cells and their expression in target tissues in order to replace absent genes, correct defective genes, or induce antitumoral activity in the tumor-bearing host.	3.477530689440975
Currently, an increasing number of gene therapy strategies are being investigated in experimental and clinical trials.	3.636594758794207
Despite substantial progress, a number of technical and logistical hurdles must still be overcome before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the human patient.	3.604512799649918
Since gene therapy involves complex cell processing and can be time consuming and costly, simplifications or even alternative approaches will be necessary in order to establish this therapy as suitable for clinical use.	3.47068843768244
This report reviews various gene therapy stategies and gene delivery techniques currently under clinical or experimental investigation.	2.8491068523080134
Special emphasis is given to cytokine gene therapy using gene-modified tumor vaccines for cancer treatment.	2.738371259187211
Using the PTB simulator, which emits real signals from patients, we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard).	2.5678960764548697
For this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial pulsewave, cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of 20 patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator.	2.9546490936026006
The invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.	3.1976741794363828
The invasive system showed a cut-off frequency of 35 Hz; the damping constant was 0.21.	3.0668534799310123
With 49 record signals from patients we carried out 15 simulated measurements each.	3.1671441713537565
From a total of 49 bio-signals from patients the Dinamap 1846 was able to process 41 signals and the HP M-1008B 47 signals.	2.9388244205718217
The mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to -2.50 mmHg, 3.35 mmHg (P<0.05) and 1.51 mmHg with the Dinamap 1846 and to -8.5 mmHg (P<0.001), -5.15 mmHg (P<0.001) and -5.58 mmHg (P<0.001) for the HP M-1008B.	3.151188881245238
The 95% confidence limit for the systolic, diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to 56 mmHg, 30 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the Dinamap 1846 and 50 mmHg, 38 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the HP M-1008B.	2.7237249258663625
The differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different artefact detection and elimination techniques.	3.474363619697886
The results of the performance tests we achieved with the PTB simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations.	3.4610543280306842
The American Association for the Advanecement of Medical Instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of 5 +/- 8 mmHg.	3.440776793835392
None of the examined instruments lay within these limits.	3.0657158604208385
Due to the systematic and stochastic errors, we think that the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard) do not achieve performance levels that are adequate for measuring critically ill patients.	2.4185776944002426
Many patients consulting medical emergency services make the initial contact because of psychiatric emergency situations.	2.892071296020533
However, emergency physicians and their assistants are usually not sufficiently experienced in psychiatry.	3.251347795782061
Therefore, psychiatric emergencies are sometimes only reluctantly accepted or inadequately treated by these services.	2.861103259033381
Our present contribution aims at improving this situation.	3.0972396262112962
It gives a review of the main diagnostic groups concerned, their symptomatology and psychopathology, and offers some advice with regard to empathic verbal interventions and counselling in those emergency situations.	3.394648997211563
3 different types of complex spinal trauma are defined: Type I means a multilevel contiguous or non contiguous unstable injury, type II is described as a spinal injury with concommitant thoracic or abdominal lesion, typ III stands for the coincidence of spinal injury and polytrauma.	3.2346524027218417
Overlapping of different types occurs.	3.9570751255979157
Type I: The incidence amounts according a german multicenter study to about 2,5 %.	3.397262109070106
Multilevel injuries need to be stabilized for a long distance from posterior.	4.338471448424169
With a thoroughful analysis the segments to be fused are determined.	3.175345123223041
Typ II: The leading thoracic injury is a lung contusion which occurs in up to 50 % of the cases.	3.478385074622809
A CT scan of the thorax during the first diagnostic screening is recommended.	3.8580488693458808
Early reduction and stabilization from posterior should be aimed at.	3.2530410001876904
During the first two weeks anterior procedures are contraindicated.	3.229192173200213
Abdominal injuries are to be found in 3-4 % of all spinal injuries.	4.823135592738842
All organs could be affected.	3.4518985696894466
A typical constallation is the "seat-belt syndrome" with lesions of the upper abdominal organs and a flexiondistraction injury of the upper lumbar spine.	3.9295408231928013
The main problem is to make the diagnosis of both components initially.	3.9712331427613137
Most of the patients may be treated in one operation by first taking care of the abdominal injury and than stabilazing the spine.	4.276409846075644
The prognosis of this combination is favorable.	3.0847722259661703
Typ III: In 17-18 % of all polytraumatized patients lesions of the spine are to be diagnosed.	4.004862765832074
From these only one third need surgical care.	3.0836994754771454
From 680 patients with operatively treated fractures of the thoracolumbar junction 6,2 % were polytraumatized according to the multicenter study mentioned above.	3.6541898311257968
Surgical stabilization should be performed in the primary phase (day-1-surgery).	4.681274772749814
Additional injuries, potentially time consuming operations with a high blood loss sometimes necessitate a different approach.	3.6776600674532562
Non stabilized spinal injuries apparently do not have the same negative effect on the whole organism as long bone fractures.	3.429101729909876
In the early phase of treatment on the C-spine only anterior procedures and on the thoraco-lumbar spine only posterior techniques should be applied.	3.5627337008722533
Experimental studies have shown that in traffic accidents with frontal impact the new airbag system can significantly reduce the incidence of severe injuries and fatal outcome.	3.522210528017188
The question of whether the airbag itself induces specific patterns of injury needs further investigation.	2.6707757388014137
Two cases of traffic accidents with airbag protection are presented here.	2.909922773530758
The first case report clearly shows the life-saving and injury-reducing effect of the airbag system in a traffic accident with frontal impact at 100 km/h.	3.1114043449909103
In the second case only minor injuries of the face were diagnosed initially.	3.3730696222473617
Hemodynamic instability occurred after 3 h of hospitalization due to rupture of the azygos vein.	3.4987374299514657
Analysis of the presented cases shows that, besides the well-known benefits, there are certain injury patterns that seem to be related to the use of airbags.	4.076381164626944
These have not been described before.	3.565594632224525
It is concluded that patients who were involved in traffic accidents with airbag deployment have to be hospitalized and followed up carefully over time, even though they are initially stable, as potentially fatal sequelae of deceleration trauma can occur later.	3.2566663821406725
In our opinion it is not possible to estimate the severity of airbag-associated injuries with conventional methods.	3.67565334766401
A questionnaire with 78 questions concerning the situation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) sufferers in Germany was distributed to a representative 3000 out of the more than 14000 patient members of the German AS society; 1614 patients (54%) responded.	3.3582414137606773
The age distribution of these patients roughly agrees with that expected due to the distribution of the age at diagnosis and the age distribution of the German population.	5.113319571008943
The group of patients more than 65 years old is, however, under-represented.	3.897934505799453
Introduction: Headache is thought to be generated by nociceptive processes within the meninges, followed by activation of trigeminal neurons within the brainstem.	3.4195746060671945
The noxious stimuli initially involved in these nociceptive processes are unknown.	3.009882117821929
A preparation was developed in the barbiturate-anesthetized rat, in which the activation of trigeminal brain stem neurons by selective local stimulation of the dura mater could be observed.	3.5252130210387476
Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall, dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors.	3.878872266983005
There are probably several candidate genes, that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis.	3.361359243293854
These genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism, regulation of blood pressure and clotting.	3.318878817372908
In contrast to rare monogenetic diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms (e.g.	2.838757116371593
familial hypercholesterolemia), genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent.	3.391020653681939
Due to their frequency, there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease.	3.1529941671122486
Genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle, environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders.	2.982047330849574
Fourty-nine patients with 50 complex acetabular fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation from August 1993 to February 1996 in a prospectively documented study.	3.3851997124515
The fractures were fixed with small fragment implants through a modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland approach).	2.611964360656088
In 10 patients the ISS was > 25 pts.	2.9874991100160093
Thirty-six patients with 37 fractures could be evaluated after 25 months on average.	2.8979636628416583
In 28 fractures (76 %) the functional outcome was good or excellent according to the d'Aubigne and Harris scores.	3.572202472864344
Radiological results were excellent in 21 fractures (57 %) and satisfactory in 12 fractures (Heeg score).	3.2696572462438125
In 7 cases (14 %) a postoperative subcutaneous seroma had to be treated surgically.	3.450321697055659
No wound infections, however, were observed.	4.897748092435693
In two cases a total hip replacement (THR) for posttraumatic arthritis had to be performed.	3.1719456706793885
Two more cases are scheduled for THR due to symptomatic femoral head necrosis.	3.147305722529924
A good joint reconstruction can be achieved through the modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland) in complex fractures of the acetabulum.	3.1959935200300045
However, the approach related morbidity seems to be worrysome.	3.397655444133028
In complex fractures with comminution in the roof of the acetabulum the prognosis remains uncertain even in cases where initial anatomic joint reconstruction can be achieved.	3.2441695118367506
The discussion on the results of open spinal surgery, in particular, on complications as a result of open surgery, e. g., the so-called post-discotomy syndrome, has led to the development of less invasive methods, especially for treatment of lumbar disc prolapses.	4.476689940258601
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are based on a variety of intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal spinal disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis.	4.295739759466182
Since the 1970 s, various methods such as mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and, in part, endoscopic intradiscal procedures have been developed and also used clinically.	3.424806787494744
The clinical results vary from 30 % good/very good results to almost 100 % good/very good results, depending on the author and study.	3.034242829336482
It is obvious that not many prospective randomized studies using either conservatively or surgically treated control groups have been conducted.	3.033202968947649
The results of these studies on intradiscal therapy methods are often analyzed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospective studies of a single method, which often have large case numbers, but do not always meet the demanding criteria for scientific study design.	3.0510609790566297
To attain good results, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only be used to treat select cases of lumbar disc disorders according to strict indication criteria.	4.07099288982015
At the present time it can be concluded that, in comparison to endoscopic und microsurgical methods, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be restricted to a small number of cases.	3.6603972640172246
A 58 year old patient with hepatitis virus C (HCV) infection had a secondary polyclonal IgG-IgM cryoglobulinemia with a benign 20 year course.	3.1551954356813714
Clincally the patient suffered from progressive pigmented purpura (PPP).	3.370375078175484
Histologic evaluation revealed a lymphocytic vasculitis.	3.354096757896611
Food containing tartrazine trig- gered flares of the PPP, as demonstrated with controlled oral provocation testing.	2.7697379630183847
In most of the previously described cases of HCV and type III cryoglobulinemia, the typical cutaneus finding was palpable purpura with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.	3.1236781069471404
Normal aging is associated with changes in body composition, thirst perception, renal function, and the hormonal regulatory systems involved in the maintenance of water and sodium balance.	3.964415029428758
The presence of many diseases and drugs common in the elderly can interact with the impaired homeostatic systems to result in clinically significant disturbances of water and sodium with accompanying symptoms, morbidity, and mortality.	3.167231114896912
These disorders, which include dehydration, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, urinary frequency, and urinary incontinence can either be prevented or promptly recognized and appropriately treated by understanding the physiological changes and clinical circumstances which put the elderly person at increased risk for deranged water and sodium balance.	2.972173190674134
Although valvular stenosis may be evaluated adequately by measuring transvalvular pressure gradients with Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, these methods have failed to provide reliable and accurate quantification of valvular regurgitation.	3.1624165562443176
In recent years the development of magnetic resonance imaging has broadened the diagnostic spectrum in cardiology, since it allows assessment of ventricular volumes without geometrical assumptions and the non-invasive quantification of blood flow within the heart and great vessels.	3.7085083234400344
The purpose of this overview is to evaluate "established" diagnostic tools and to show the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of valvular heart disease.	3.5962060029029943
Solvent induced polyneuropathy and encephalopathy have been acknowledged quite recently as occupational diseases in Germany.	3.0671196944665624
For compensation first of all the diagnosis has to be proven.	4.127818833091628
For differential diagnosis other known causes as well as non-organic mental diseases must be taken into consideration.	3.365671576840483
The causality between proven exposures and diagnosed disease has at least to be probable.	2.9610475696469414
To evaluate causation extensive experience of the experts is needed.	3.2818815091518734
Possibilities and limitations of sensitive diagnostic measures such as neurographic, neuropsychologic and neuroimaging examinations are discussed.	3.094812408363764
The prognosis of toxic polyneuropathy and encephalopathy is in general favorable if exposure has stopped.	2.859372842560286
Standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine.	3.7893653322907426
Spondylosis deformans, osteochondrosis and uncovertebral arthrosis are well depicted by such images.	2.9428680935761427
Whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms.	3.946804061756913
Special projections (anteroposterior oblique radiographs, lateral radiographs in flexion and extension) may be the next step.	3.6904469612898545
For many abnormalities, mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon, MR imaging has become the standard procedure, largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution.	3.60054128501024
CT can be used instead of MR imaging if the latter method is not available, and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities.	4.261333487953941
Scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for MR imaging or CT. Myelograms and myelo-CT can no longer be considered routine imaging methods.	3.6220844356523
A number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context.	4.091031404332694
We report on three years of experience with a new method of a simultaneous endoscopically assisted anterior release in the prone position, combined with transpedicular posterior scoliosis correction and fixation.	3.287706669628597
In 60 cases this simultaneous approach yielded substantial advantages.	2.9632222026305346
True derotation of the apex - even in the thoracic spine - is achieved.	3.730143632445799
In cases of total canalicular occlusion or the total absence of the lacrimal apparatus the functional restoration requires the repair of a newly created lacrimal system.	3.3381333958430783
The intraoperatively reestablisted lacrimal drainage from the conjunctival sac will be maintained by a plastic tube.	3.0692993147630667
Beside other criteria the influence of the used inserted materials polyethylene or silicone should be evaluated.	3.4486940134998334
A prospective, randomized and controlled trial is conducted to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting in high grade symptomatic carotid artery stenoses.	2.9086505517423134
Magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines.	2.9503159208987357
However, the patient is exposed to static as well as to time-dependent magnetic fields and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.	4.0189869359570185
In 1997 the Strahlenschutzkommission, the German Radiological Protection Commission, passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics.	3.578208651587513
In this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given.	2.7826236949324548
In the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed, as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields, the gradient fields and the radio-frequency fields.	3.150710509313912
Additionally, advice is given for the protection of high-risk patients, personnel, and the general public, together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers.	4.384543257833307
Granuloma faciale is known to be difficult to treat.	4.552965457719085
Cryosurgery is an effective and minimally invasive therapy for this granulomatous inflammation of the skin.	3.910519048997344
It should be considered as an alternative to dapsone.	5.162672939395216
The results of early conversion of war fractures by the application of AO osteosynthesis in A group (n = 32) of the injuried, were compared with B group (n = 187) of injuried, treated definitely with external fixator.	3.812001845814397
There were statistical evaluations and X-ray observations of healing in both groups, as well as the appearances of the most frequent complications such as: Pintract infection, osteitis, pseudoarthrosis and reoperation.	4.052158261132777
Statistically less significant appearance of complications in A group during 2th and 6th month (p < 0.001) was observed.	3.567547350426772
In 12th month of observation, these differences statistically disappeared.	2.8777019660243144
Healing observed by X-ray in 2th, 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups.	3.2836526352004776
Since 1993, 30 patients with acute intraarticular distal radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	2.7829334179993936
In 12 patients (40%) concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed.	4.137500317089959
According to Geissler we found grade I-tear in one patient, grade II in three, grade III in six and grade IV in two patients.	3.3799523904710043
The eight individuals with grade III-and IV-lesions additionally revealed marked instablity intraoperatively.	3.2036035179993174
Therefore, operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and scaphocapitate arthrodesis.	2.852984519076695
Seven patients out of this group (87.5%) were followed up clinically and radiologically 3 years postoperatively, on average.	3.778986105591088
Clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability.	3.0978038815639923
Objective grip strength was measured using a Jamar tester and compared to the contralateral wrist.	3.8447074037868187
Radiological evaluation consisted of the posteroanterior and lateral view as well as stress views in radial and ulnar deviation.	3.5514131246645246
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and Cooney scoring system as well as the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	2.2473492961501007
According to Gartland, 100% of our patients showed an excellent result; these rates were 86% using the Jakim score and 60% using the Cooney scoring system.	3.013766552552241
According to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result.	3.8443237980535443
Open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard.	3.6265594179617127
Arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases.	3.555135395424337
Therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization.	3.2665214727166485
This prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization.	3.8246784968749457
In 1991 the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest with Doppler sonography was accepted by the Medical Council of the Bundesaerztekammer as one of the methods able to shorten the waiting time for fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of cerebral death.	3.3982610598468863
A survey was undertaken to determine how frequently Doppler sonography has been used since that time in certifying brain death.	3.244713614579058
A total of 400 questionnaires were sent out to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.	2.7212728295400077
In all, 226 questionnaires were returned.	2.8271967329183263
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography has been used to certify brain death, mostly combined with other methods.	3.2733438665990664
The question of whether false positive results have been observed was answered five times in the affirmative.	3.115792563574292
The background to these cases was clarified by telephone calls.	3.4476956006329735
In order to indicate pitfalls, the examiners reported borderline situations which in part did not fulfil the prerequisites.	2.761154156155526
In none of these cases had the diagnosis of brain death been based on ultrasound data.	4.483844977294722
Doppler sonography for the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest has been used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments in Germany as an additional confirmatory test and rather seldom as the only method to shorten the waiting period.	3.9222035454795527
We report on a 64-year-old man who died within 1 h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency.	3.309177887288635
Autopsy showed as cause of death a clinically unknown coagulase-negative staphylococci-induced left-sided endocarditis with perforation of the aortic and mitral valve.	3.5475080106897487
Infective endocarditis by coagulase-negative staphylococci in native valves is a rare event.	3.4924036104248124
The macroscopic appearance and histological findings are presented and discussed.	3.3875226813249566
Thrombolysis therapy in childhood and adolescence has brought about numerous case reports, but no controlled studies over dosage and duration of therapy have been published to date.	3.9601442717794826
The myringotomy perforations should have a diameter greater than 2 mm to ventilate the middle ear for approximately 3 weeks.	3.1998906379386587
Comparison by skin epiluminescent microscopy of 60 malignant melanomas and 130 junctional and compound naevocellular naevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 characteristics.	2.9432665600168453
The following microscopical in vivo signs that can be defined by histopathological examination were found only in malignant or premalignant melanocytic lesions: digitated radial streaming, greyish-blue reticular patterns, opaque gypseous alabaster lacunas, brown/black dots on a blue/greyish background, pseudopodia at the periphery and blue-in-pink areas.	2.7650691628291013
Nevertheless, specific epiluminescent phenomena of histopathologically defined malignant melanomas are still unknown.	2.8151168927017163
Therefore, diagnostic evaluation of malignancy is based mainly on microscopic assessment of combined details of morphology and colour of melanocytic tumours.	3.1504860054776733
The present study examines the relationship between different psychological variables (including anxiety, depression, locus of control, expectations of pain intensity and social support) and postoperative pain, analgesic consumption and satisfaction with the pain management in a study sample of 67 patients.	3.366603712229031
Clinical experience of 11 patients with CHARGE association is reviewed.	3.00243809355279
The study comprised six girls and five boys.	3.0316993863491324
All presented with congenital heart disease.	3.564975899281621
Eight had bilateral choanal atresia.	3.418118316010027
Nine patients suffered abnormal pinnae or deafness.	3.0489262026070514
In addition to major abnormalities, further anomalies of the orofacial region and the upper airways occurred in all patients.	3.1446873210237793
All children exhibited velopharyngeal incoordination and swallowing problems often resulting in recurrent aspiration pneumonia.	2.6899826061710863
Three patients had cleft lip and palate.	2.7816298226166314
Both micrognathia and high-arched palate were present in two patients.	3.7754518588429162
Facial palsy was observed in six patients.	4.14163378524734
Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate specialities.	3.428209331812537
The anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible.	3.1830371878439685
In our experience, the transpalatal approach is far more satisfactory than the transnasal.	2.8813420751074026
It gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair.	3.3735046911804902
After the child has grown stronger, a long-term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training.	3.414000623307325
Thrilling are especially those situations, when people have to make ethical decisions.	3.306666201050076
Issues of medical ethics crop up not only in hospital series, but often in genres where this subject is hardly to be supposed: comedies, westerns, love stories and gangster movies.	3.015954454481868
Enacting these conflicts means offering a solution, and in doing so films refer to moral values and - at the same time - function as seismographs for the social relevance of bioethical topics.	3.377727397622598
But it is possible that ethical principles of good decision-making fall victims to the drama of the story.	3.221450881883058
Analysis of the portrayed conflict is similar to a case discussion in bioethics and represents a helpful adjunct to the procurement of analytical and communicative competences.	2.7925753967215776
Several experimental studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrate a decrease of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.	3.097767040750062
Proliferation or clonogenic tumor cells most likely is the major mechanism underlying this phenomenon.	3.4434305091214603
Important progress in radiation oncology might therefore be expected from inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment.	3.091679837169323
Possibilities to minimize the time factor are briefly discussed.	3.739041658463355
Inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by inhibition of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation, or by pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis are scientifically interesting but currently not proven to be effective to counteract the loss of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment of fractionated irradiation.	3.063674415551707
At present, the only established approach is to complete radiotherapy within a short overall treatment time, e. g. by accelerated fractionation and by prevention or compensation of unscheduled treatment gaps.	3.1575533141153262
Technical innovations and software improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution sonography (US) have definitely influenced the diagnostic imaging of rheumatic diseases.	3.2373057333499533
For MRI, improvements in surface coils, dedicated low-field systems (0.2 T), and software improvements (shorter acquisition times and refinements of fat suppressing techniques) must be mentioned.	3.479286120418455
For sonography, the main innovations concern the development of higher transducer frequencies (7-15 Mhz) and power Doppler imaging.	3.7118272284614697
Clinical evaluations have shown that MRI and US are most useful in cases of suspected rheumatic disease with negative plain film radiographs and for documenting the course of the disease, diagnosing of early rheumatoid arthritis, making a differential diagnosis in clinically unclear rheumatic diseases, investigating vascularization, and quantifying pannus formation.	3.5163345153971606
In order to improve diagnostic efficacy the role of MRI and US in the management of patients with rheumatic disease should be reconsidered.	3.965005145567934
In addition to renal elimination and gastrointestinal metabolism (amylase; splenic and hepatic dextranase) colloid plasma solutions like dextran and hydroxyethyl starch deposit in tissues, especially in the reticuloendothelial system (RES).	2.7240344410270763
This tissue storage is limited in time (weeks to months), is influenced by the employed solution and other factors (lysosomes) and has usually no clinical importance (no RES blockade).	3.4792899043436543
We report here a case study of a patient with sepsis (lung, liver and kidney failure) who had an overload of the RES with colloids while being treated with dextran (molecular weight 40000 and 70000 daltons) and hydroxyethyl starch (mw 450000 daltons, molar substitution 0,7).	2.9268195171805016
In the late seventies and early eighties the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) became epidemic among young menstruating women.	2.7957691049855775
A strong correlation was found between TSS and the rising popularity of hyperabsorbent tampons.	3.0602976167638842
Exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus is seen as the main mediator of TSS in controlled clinical trials.	3.4592419639789065
Menstrual and nonmenstrual forms of TSS are differentiated.	3.3663073324047965
The nonmenstrual form is comparatively rare and has a high rate of mortality rate.	4.2356992867070975
Several studies showed that the overall incidence of menstrual and nonmenstrual TSS is approximately 1-3 cases per 100 000 persons.	3.5194949968559786
The severe form of the syndrome leads to multiorgan dysfunction.	3.555502226775238
The streptococcal TSS (STSS) caused by group A Streptococci is clinically similar to the staphylococcal TSS.	3.1458056709157094
Both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci produce the exotoxin TSST-1.	2.849085390180435
New methods allow the detection of TSST-1 production.	3.321584383350964
However, due to the low incidence of TSS, this method of detection has not yet been taken up in the routine diagnostic procedures.	4.047345756648051
This report focusses on the emergence and spread of S. aureus with special clinical and epidemiological significance.	3.0593963267173483
Results from typing MRSA originating from different clinical sources in all Germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the mecA gene to clonal groups of S. aureus which have been until now sensitive.	3.061136454027442
These newly emerging MRSA are still sensitive to a number of other antibiotics.	3.6523825217329486
This results in less broad resistance phenotypes of currently disseminated MRSA.	2.7869582358752942
Worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by S. aureus possessing secC and not tst.	3.4716604312661428
Background: For cataract surgery in this country retro- and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method.	3.6627011577683235
It totally stops eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain.	4.0366295612550624
Especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications, but the potential risks can be severe.	4.135345494244731
In the past sponge anesthesia could not be used on patients with difficult cataract surgery due to the insufficient anesthetic effect.	3.898334562273764
In patients with coronary artery disease, it is controversial whether cardiac arrhythmias result from acute subendocardial ischemia.	3.6315156068453236
The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia.	2.8319276688711152
The immunopathogenesis of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated.	3.2919401543157534
Therefore, the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area.	3.6014257823587164
During treatment of lung tuberculosis disordered breathing with hypoventilation during REM-sleep, hypoxemia and persistent hypercapnia during daytime were found.	2.868606077917533
This complication in myopathies is caused by weakness of respiratory muscles and leads to negative features (like pulmonary hypertension, daytime-sleepiness, growth failure or further impairement of the muscle disease).	3.254554093667298
Diagnostic steps in disorders of breathing during sleep in children with neuromuscular disease are shown.	3.6112312209281856
Aortic dissection with no entry or false lumen flow was recently identified as intramural hemorrhage of the aortic wall (IMH).	3.1745473534214894
Analysis of the literature revealed 209 cases of in vivo diagnosed IMH reflecting 17% of all dissections, whereas in autoptic studies this condition is found in 4-13%.	3.7302623269186244
Transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and aortography (to rule out dissection) have been applied for diagnosing IMH in 57, 49, 43 and 38% of the cases, respectively.	3.6207765670343157
However, diagnostic accuracy of each modality is not available to date.	3.3819845981185894
In 34%, IMH involves the ascending aorta (type A).	3.01110003226131
The average age of patients with IMH ranges between 55 and 65 years; 65% are males.	3.495823018188741
In 12%, IMH was associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.	3.3684140112797305
With 87%, arterial hypertension is the predominant risk factor for IMH irrespective of its location.	3.614433128563077
As suggested by the term "mediastinal apoplexy" IMH may - similar to cerebral apoplexy - result from hypertensive rupture of the vasa vasorum in the aortic media.	3.0990599075762373
With 97%, the majority of patients present with acute chest or back pain similar to classic dissection.	3.6062658258586247
Mediastinal widening is found in 83%; signs of hemothorax/pleural effusion are present in 38%, acute aortic regurgitation in 26%, pericardial effusion in 23%, acute neurologic deficits in 12%, and pulse deficits in 5%.	3.244927857092258
In 18%, IMH progresses to dissection and in another 15% to rupture.	3.4426616308731437
In 25% and 28%, respectively, dissection and rupture occur in the ascending aorta and in 12% and 9%, respectively, in the descending thoracic aorta.	4.478361273282289
With surgical repair, mortality of type A IMH is lowered to 18% compared to 60% with medical treatment (p<0.01).	3.4677451337454985
In contrast, with 8% mortality associated with medical treatment, prognosis of type B IMH is more favorable without surgical intervention, the latter associated with a 30-day mortality of 33% (p<0.05).	3.7155307826676163
Thus, IMH is a potential precursor of dissection and should be managed like dissection with undelayed surgical intervention in patients with type A IMH and with medical treatment in type B IMH.	4.172585291446396
We report on 3 exemplary case studies of patients with myelomeningocele who are under regular care in our outpatient clinic, and discuss the clinical and diagnostic problems and the therapeutic concept of fractures in patients with myelomeningocele.	4.638275403285984
Our case reports are in accordance to previous publications; they show that signs of confined and systemic infection and variable X-ray signs with often extensive reactive formation of callus make the diagnosis of fractures in myelomeningocele patients difficult.	3.2846490055237623
Fractures often occur without pain or trauma.	3.260982615096218
Background: Since the end of the 1960ies, accidents have been identified as the most common cause of mortality in children and account for considerable childhood morbidity in industrialized western countries.	3.9711469642006416
In contrast to traffic-related accidents in older children and adolescents, which were consequently registered and documented, no epidemiological data exist about home injuries and accidents during the first years of life in Germany.	3.512413326229777
This report presents data on accident-related hospitalizations in a cohort of 10271 infants, who participated in a prospective vaccine efficacy trial in Germany from 1991 to 1994.	3.2878736396801624
The indications for electrophysiological study were disabling palpitation, syncope, or presyncope, intracardiac conduction disturbance, and bradyarrhythmia.	2.6833169524667038
In one patient the efficacy of oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated by repeat electrophysiological study.	3.655918128921648
Atrial overdrive stimulation was performed in patients with atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia.	4.579257186663899
On the basis of the result of electrophysiological testing, 25 patients were believed not to require any treatment, 16 patients received new drug therapy, 7 patients underwent catheter ablation in a second session, 2 patients had either a pacemaker or an ICD implanted, and 1 patient continued to receive the drug therapy that had been tested.	3.5282599095224327
Atrial overdrive stimulation resulted in a regular sinus rhythm in 66 patients (69%).	3.3277485190632534
Except for one patient in whom atrial flutter could not be terminated, atrial fibrillation was induced in the remaining 30 patients.	4.052557450686945
After the procedure, patients were monitored for 30 min in case of overdrive stimulation, and for approximately 3 h after electrophysiological study or 6 h if additional coronary angiography had been performed.	3.9586229725396826
Severe complications were not observed.	3.250544079019425
In 10 cases minor hematoma occurred at the puncture site without serious sequelae.	2.869930257594305
- Outpatients electrophysiological study as well as atrial overdrive stimulation are feasible and safe in a selected group of patients.	3.600692923535446
Endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects.	3.93144158379207
A retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long-term results.	3.312165268369996
A total of 128 implants were inserted, 110 implants in the periorbital, 12 implants in the mastoid, and six implants in the paranasal region; 113 implants were short craniofacial Brånemark implants, and 15 implants were dental implants.	3.0770721163565047
The success rate for implant survival was 94.5%.	3.170559032194072
Long-term results were promising and more than satisfactory, leading to a large indication for these endosteal implants.	3.292067210560162
The term "Ecstasy" includes a group of different methylenedioxyamphetamines which produce hallucinogenic activity, stimulation and the so-called 'entactogenic' effects.	3.2468872333117775
- "Entactogen" is usually translated as "producing a touching within" or "creating an internal contact" and refers to the special psychotropic effect of this substances.	2.881716075901241
Entactogens have been reported to make users aware of previously unconscious feelings and experiences.	3.5054028394334553
The "entactogenic" effect is the most typical of the psychedelic effects n 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA).	3.584360502715267
MDMA induces euphoria and acts stimulating, but the most common effect of MDMA is a heightened sense of "closeness" with other people.	3.567220029773197
The negative effects, especially depression and a general sense of anxiety, may endure after the acute phase of ecstasy.	3.4526222792514734
Ecstasy is not a novel substance.	4.658997347283585
However, the rapid spread connected with the arising techno-scene and the increasing prevalence of ecstasy-use world-wide is unprecedented.	3.0421553701406077
Cisatracurium - one of the ten stereoisomers of atracurium - is an intermediate long-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.	3.1709082058512954
After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to either receive 3xED95 or 5xED95 of cisatracurium or 3xED90 of vecuronium prior to intubation as a bolus.	2.213880727051562
After oral premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam anaesthesia was induced with thiopental (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5%-2%).	3.4527928134718957
Six minutes after administration of thiopental, patients received the muscle relaxant.	3.686984367310819
Six minutes later 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	2.161552909964846
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	2.1747056104515066
Changes of heart rate or blood pressure >20% compared to baseline were defined as clinically significant.	3.3074629730386853
After application of the study drug, median values of blood pressure and heart rate were stable.	4.277405002692316
For each muscle relaxant, there were several patients who had statistically significant cardiovascular changes.	3.711737384805221
After 3xED95 cisatracurium, 3 of 21 patients exhibited haemodynamic changes >20% (2 exhibited hypotension and 1 tachycardia), while in the high-dose cisatracurium group 2 of 21 patients demonstrated a tachycardia that was predetermined to be statistically but not clinically significant.	3.61198673729556
In the vecuronium group, 2 of 20 patients sustained statistically significant hypotension and 1 patient had statistically significant tachycardia.	3.6215062928481854
The frequency of all individual cardiovascular changes after the application of the muscle relaxant was not dose-dependent.	3.4651437032259405
After the administration of cisatracurium in two different doses (3xED95 and 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) only minor cardiovascular changes were observed.	3.0754670784534777
Both drugs proved to be safe for use during induction of anaesthesia in patients ASA I-II.	3.3034980983013154
With regard to its cardiovascular effects, cisatracurium shares with vecuronium the requirements of an ideal muscle relaxant.	3.0510866157686767
Between June 1993 and September 1995, 18 distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail.	3.3309862632715177
The operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch.	2.7484370519623464
Follow-up was available on all patients and averaged 18.3 months (range 6-32 months).	3.6972106912291887
All fractures healed with an average time to union of 12.4 weeks (range 8-16 weeks).	3.808901857984766
Bone grafting was not necessary in any case.	3.465403651383134
Sixteen patients achieved almost the same ROM as they had had before the injury.	3.214032860792273
One patient developed a varus malignment and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy 20 months post trauma.	2.9065007679104653
There were no infections or nonunions.	2.8936777954480504
The retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of dia- and supracondylar femoral fractures.	3.6934254557585757
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogenic (AAA) bone is an osteoinductive preparation of completely demineralized bone matrix.	2.6042193140157663
It has been clinically applied for years.	2.895637139970935
In an experimental study in rabbits, we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with AAA bone.	3.7406082903907234
Two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits.	3.572590039507165
A cell-excluding PTFE membrane was wrapped circularly around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum.	3.4431803699248467
The posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane.	3.1015371168088195
Thus, two compartments were created selectively, preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants.	3.1977501706365965
For each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative CT (pQCT) scans.	3.175646498246413
Implantation of AAA bone led to new bone formation in both compartments.	3.353486599788452
Contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost fourfold increase in bone volume.	3.584392294798535
Although bone formation showed interindividual variations, the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the Student's t-test for paired samples (P < 0.0001).	3.2055364141810543
The data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized.	3.1571325311799217
In osseous augmentations with AAA bone, the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant.	3.7414464570832893
Shielding from the periosteum, e.g., by cell-excluding membranes, leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of AAA bone and should therefore be avoided.	3.409208776239619
Computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in Europe.	3.2708496373981104
Reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern CT scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes.	2.998953466646152
The lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low-dose CT owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma.	3.4123348533052993
Undernutrition, particularly protein undernutrition, contributes to the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture, by lowering bone mass and altering muscle strength.	3.417819439654413
Furthermore, the rate of medical complications after fracture can also be increased by nutritional deficiency.	3.975159749057755
The IGF-I system appears to be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to osteoporotic hip fracture in elderly and to its complications.	3.7160528131553905
In the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin D supplies, protein supplements increasing the intakes from low to normal, raises IGF-I levels, improves the clinical outcome after hip fracture, and attenuates the decrease in proximal femur bone mineral density in the year following the fracture.	3.1684321461411424
This nutritional approach is associated with a significant reduction of the stay in rehabilitation hospital.	4.387571755819516
This underlines the importance of nutritional supports in preventing and healing osteoporotic fractures.	3.2614843792098576
The article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised.	4.035080034770836
The chances for a refinancing of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the realm of public law.	3.0679850591814635
With the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects.	2.791887495088415
Simultaneously it gains normative significance.	3.2846042695756386
This is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions, and further in the context of the discussion concerning the revitalisation of local social policy for the elderly.	3.7094433383451313
Precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the municipalities may be excused from their responsibility to form, preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly.	3.1350508637072863
A comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens (p53, PCNA, Ki67), DNA flow-cytometry and ultrastructures of neoplastic cells from 120 cases of laryngeal cancers.	2.788510584134367
Clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority (T3, 43%; T4, 18%).	3.804332047687654
A 5-grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei.	3.7588444942098587
Positive staining was obtained in 70% for p53, 57% for Ki67 and 80% for PCNA.	3.0663241963409145
Sixty-two percent of the cases were DNA-diploid and 38% DNA-aneuploid.	4.160111964423747
The DNA-diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei, preservation of wide margins of nuclear heterochromatin, enlargements of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei.	3.4647364124151223
A frequent finding was euchromatization of chromatin.	2.978778371503924
Dense chromatin appeared in the form of small clumps spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei.	3.3717197802687355
Enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found.	3.379990540855099
The antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds.	3.1662869907323907
Until twenty years ago, aspirin, phenazone derivatives and acetaminophen had been used as standard remedies for intercurrent harmless pain conditions in connection with infections, trauma, small surgeries, but also for tension headache and other painful conditions.	3.411087215936616
During the last decades, this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2-arylpropionic acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation.	3.9469408494680436
Some of them (e.g.	2.289848536130918
ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) have been given over-the-counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses.	3.5446610588973577
Nevertheless, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions.	3.3349021804518677
A 38-year-old man presented with an intracranial extra-axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma.	3.311920649854805
Meningeal melanocytoma is a rare, benign melanotic tumour of the leptomeninges occuring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults.	3.781211050561745
It shows characteristic cytologic features with isomorphic epitheloid or spindle-shaped cells, often with prominent nucleoli and a variable content of intracytoplasmic melanin.	3.0374294971756695
It usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate, necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies.	2.8193066093040393
Its immunohistological profile with S-100 protein-, vimentin- and HMB-45-positive tumour cells is similar to that of (primary or metastatic) malignant melanoma.	3.3557132561563767
This differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications.	4.122020364439964
Therefore, everyone dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare, but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma.	2.976609588110834
A 54-year old, obese woman suffered from massive symmetrical swelling of the face, especially of the upper and lower eyelids.	3.89150462352862
Initially the swelling occured intermittently, but after 2 years it was permanent and progressive markedly limiting her visual fields.	3.050990949356849
Neither laboratory findings nor imaging procedures provided any firm evidence of an underlying cardiac, renal or endocrinological disease.	2.9930505533893377
There was no suggestion of a storage disease.	2.915913325978266
Skin biopsy showed foam cells and granulomatous inflammation, so the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having a monosymptomatic Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome.	3.196807312407935
Treatment with clofazimine 100 mg daily was initiated.	3.092370867109532
Regular follow-up visits over 7 months revealed no evidence of recurrence.	3.741724552923485
The patient died a sudden cardiac death a few months later.	3.5864485483016857
The relatives refused an autopsy.	3.3700622086149026
The definite cause of her facial swelling remains unclear as we discuss the differential diagnostic possibilities.	3.5308591323993204
An 81-year-old patient had prolonged competitive neuromuscular blockade with train-of-four ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively, after two successive anaesthesia procedures (enflurane-N2O/O2; vecuronium-succinylcholine-sequence) for transurethral prostate resection.	3.0866353916179543
Although antagonism with neostigmine was promptly successful after the first, 65-min period of anaesthesia (1.5 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation, 3 mg vecuronium), repetitive and chronologically staggered administration of neostigmine after the second, 30-min period of anaesthesia (1 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation) had hardly any effect, so that the patient had to be ventilated mechanically for a total of 4.5 h. Laboratory analysis revealed homozygous, atypical, plasma cholinesterase (790 U/l; dibucaine number 23; genotype E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|).	2.707282670656557
This retrospectively confirmed a succinylcholine-induced phase II block in both instances, as had already been suspected following the second anaesthetic procedure.	3.106086163707546
The degree of block transformation, and thus the available time, are decisive in explaining the diverse effects of antagonism here.	3.1850506196647945
It must be assumed that a complete phase II block developed after the first succinylcholine exposure owing to the longer duration of anaesthesia; the purely competitive component (train-of-four ratio 0.1) was easily antagonized by neostigmine.	3.115351345898152
At the time of the attempted antagonism after the second, shorter period of anaesthesia, however, block transformation was still incomplete (train-of-four ratio 0.5).	3.3317068981640365
The administration of neostigmine therefore rather intensified the depolarization segment of the mixed block, so that repeated attempts at antagonism then inhibited any further block transformation.	3.052372628702527
The Ph1-negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) are described, and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given.	3.2963861113051074
These are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2,331 patients with CMPDs among a total of 34,160 patients referred between 1 January 1989 and 30 June 1994 to the Bone Marrow Registry.	3.2870645167574035
These cases of CMPD break down into the main groups as follows: CML 23.2 %, megakaryocytic myelosis consistent with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia 22.3 %, essential thrombocythemia 22.1 %, and polycythemia vera 20.4 %; 12.0 % of cases were unclassifiable.	2.5967181220458118
Histological progress in each group is characterized by (1) increasing number and pleomorphy of megakaryocytes, (2) increasing fibrosis, and (3) excess of blasts.	4.0078291977678
These three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy.	3.7284552738778243
Therefore, it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively.	2.8770919919656817
A staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced.	3.9051313637263743
Its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic biop-sies.	3.742462825654582
Chondral and osteochondral lesions as well as bone bruises of the ankle are caused in the most cases by trauma and are localized almost exclusively at the talus.	4.188841940033116
For diagnosis, operative management and follow up, magnetic resonance imaging was useful, which can be further improved by application of intravenous or intraarticullar contrast enhancement (Gadolinium).	3.7626239066739973
In adults operative therapy is favored.	3.273055403325342
Due to new techniques, arthroscopy became an important alternative to arthrotomy.	3.215405209898319
According to the stage of the disease, drilling or curettage, removal or fixation of the fragment, autologous bone transplantation or osteochondral graft can be performed.	3.399179185731585
All procedures can be managed arthroscopically.	4.093959882302583
General Psychotherapy isn't a new type of therapy, but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically-oriented psychotherapists.	3.78318420696311
The contents of this model are defined.	3.821690243892967
Arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods.	2.888088775103265
The procedure rules should be joined together by a theoretical conception of psychological functioning, from which their relative significance and prescription conditions can be derived.	2.840928388561809
A consistency-theory based model of psychological functioning is sketched, from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other.	3.1855007807578266
The advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed.	4.000030187217047
In the Federal Republic of Germany, no data existed regarding the frequency of open heart surgery for excision of cardiac neoplasms.	3.394017014104095
Therefore, a standard questionnaire concerning heart tumors was sent to all 77 German heart centers performing cardiac surgery.	2.9236465746411073
Although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer, randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates.	3.462563211063529
All randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage III and IV disease.	4.21955344394533
In our opinion, this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials (maximum 18%).	3.6744809645402556
estimate that a 40%-50% complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen.	3.6518338810084106
To date, such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been attainable in resectable T2-T3, N0-N2 disease.	2.8483858447625785
Therefore, we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages.	3.2960631992972793
Patients (pts) were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin/5-FU prior to surgery and radiotherapy (arm A, 70 pts) or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy (arm B, 74 pts).	3.3992357993242224
Patients were classified according to primary tumour site and neck disease.	2.873395075611393
The observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer (CR: 43%, PR: 37%, NR: 15%, PD: 5%).	3.244751534419767
After a follow-up of 12-96 months overall survival was 58% in arm A and 45% in arm B (n.s.).	2.9203566681408644
Disease-free survival in arm A (61%) is statistically significantly better than in arm B (43%, P=0.03).	3.517294524880915
Therefore, we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and tonsils and stage T2-T3 and N0-N2 disease prior to surgery.	3.755292481421505
Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery has evolved as a reliable method to perform left internal mammary artery (LIMA) bypass surgery to the LAD.	3.49498774897614
This novel technique represents a synthesis of known approaches to coronary surgery using sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation and limited access techniques in general thoracic surgery.	2.9766247401837225
Applying specially designed tools for both harvesting the internal mammary artery and mechanically stabilizing the anterior surface of the heart during anastomosis, this approach is gaining widespread acceptance.	3.515089817449672
A steadily growing number of patients with proximal LAD lesions are submitted to cardiac surgery and the procedure is performed with increasing success rates, now approaching 98% short term patency.	3.844614502584529
Our experience and the treatment results (debridement, drainage and external fixation) are presented.	3.7308310522694352
The methodology, complications and final results are also given for 15 patients.	3.4198857831829583
Consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as spongioplasty or internal fixation conversion methods.	3.599967152661982
The time to consolidation without complications was 28.6 weeks (24-36) and with complications (deep infections, chronic osteomyelitis) 40.8 weeks (28-68).	3.34081327127845
In total, there was one poor result with angulation, shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent fistulation.	3.3870743412744706
The average follow-up was 22.7 months (1-34 months).	3.525543184257737
Our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation.	3.882155593385459
Under war conditions, primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results.	2.9637789855550523
Minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly.	3.3686017504241033
Introduction of the computed tomography index CTDI and the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) has led to standardization of the dose description in CT examinations.	3.0119122297902323
Despite the use of these dose parameters, many different dosages are reported in the literature for different CT methods.	3.887423623294579
In addition, there is still a wide range of radiation dosimetry results reported for conventional CT, helical CT, and HRCT used in chest examinations.	3.3082748477681743
The variations in dosage are mainly due to differences in factors affecting the dose, i. e. beam geometry, beam quality, scanner geometry ("generation"), and operating parameters.	3.444855110015161
Recent studies calculating differences in factors affecting dosage and CT dosimetry and using similar operating parameters, show similar results in CT dosimetry for conventional and helical CT. On the other hand, dosages for HRCT were greatly reduced.	2.862276671884884
Central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients.	3.524826262930645
In most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli.	3.4651998732092784
Despite the introduction of hypocoagulative drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about 10 % in trauma patients.	3.70226719928629
Estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too.	3.6661274548093905
In haemodynamically symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated, mortality rates of up to 93 % are reported in literature.	4.264679654099096
After introduction of the heart- and lung-machine in the surgical concept of therapy, survival rates have increased significantly.	3.996266401390046
We report on three cases of successful surgical embolectomy after CPR.	2.853708698721793
In a review of literature current concepts of treatment in central pulmonary embolism are discussed.	3.9605474165771533
Imaging of tumors of the pancreas may have a series of significant implications for surgical decision making.	4.008055701149585
First of all verification and localization of a suspected tumor is crucial.	3.3096606652032867
Later on, accurate staging of local tumor extent and of distant metastases is necessary for evaluating the indications for surgical intervention.	3.5302744604489353
If histologic proof of malignancy of a pancreatic lesion is needed, different imaging techniques can be used for percutaneous biopsy of the tumor.	3.652986845196084
Finally imaging is required in patients with a pancreatic tumor if an obstruction of the common bile duct is treated with palliative intent by endoscopy or transhepatic intervention.	3.70648873182478
A rational and efficient selection from all the imaging techniques currently available requires a clear-cut definition of what is needed for surgical decision making in each individual case.	3.144841726215174
Thereby one has to take into account whether the tumor arises from the exocrine or from the endocrine tissue of the pancreas.	3.795014024026567
In spite of the importance of skin diseases in Africa south of the Sahara, dermatology is insufficiently represented within the established primary health care systems.	2.9520633552359903
Aim of this study was to find out whether an integrated dermatology project could reduce the prevalence of dermatoses.	3.225013964179681
Magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be a sensitive method for diagnostics of the red bone marrow, the composition of which changes physiologically and during pathological processes.	3.5217454599533164
However, the interpretation of MRI in patients with disorders of the red bone marrow is very difficult.	4.639047155357213
The aim of this study was the characterization of the proton spectrum of healthy bone marrow and its age- and sex-dependent changes to obtain a data basis for measurements in patients.	2.9402936621047946
We report a case of a 26-year-old patient, a tilelayer by profession, with a history of a fall from a height of 5 meters with blunt thoracic injury and resultant left atrial rupture.	3.133517718612249
The emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 3 points) with no recordable blood pressure.	2.9805487525146086
After two hours of resuscitation at the site of accident and at the closest emergency traumatology unit a marginal blood pressure was seen.	3.3613784590243188
With a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the nearest cardiothoracic surgical unit.	3.1575238405099104
On arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro-femoral cannulation was supported by a heart-lung-machine circulation.	3.3110315172952838
Through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated.	3.7698220771629685
The heart was effectively emptied and with deep hypothermia with a reduction of oxygen consumption by all organs especially the brain was taken care of.	3.388572240073483
The patient could be discharged from hospital on the 18th postoperative day in absolute good health.	3.0946642101788626
Since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary, there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families.	3.6635179081992097
The specific features of mitochondrial genetics, however, hamper straightforward definition of recurrence risks as in Mendelian diseases.	3.3590666413947714
Empirical risks were recently provided for MELAS and MERRF syndromes and for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.	2.9061228198800553
In MELAS and MERFF, higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the mothers' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring.	3.3638688527895293
Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring.	2.9568850260354442
As Leigh syndrome is found with maternal, autosomal recessive or X chromosomal transmission, the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling.	3.427624893546416
Prenatal diagnosis was reported only in one case of mitochondrial disease so far, and in our opinion it remains questionable because of the uncertain correlation of the proportion of mutant DNA in chorionic villi and in  clinically relevant tissues such as brain.	4.2936917237816274
An accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by Matthias Grünewald in his painting "The Temptation of St. Anthony", which is part of the Isenheim altar piece (1512 - 1516), which is now exhibited in Colmar, Alsace.	3.0781235242712377
The term Sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative eponymic designation "Grünewald naevus".	2.7636246486414136
The most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic TNM classification.	3.520310437224411
In recent years conservative therapies such as preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy are used more often with limited tissue evaluation resulting in insufficient or even inaccurate staging data.	2.8276592631156867
Thus, more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary.	3.1573137089321914
This article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine) used for breast cancer staging.	3.3130871682404686
Furthermore, results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging.	3.6613083322908446
The lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot.	2.969528084563547
The equinus (a contracture of the triceps surae muscle), the abduction and clubfoot deformity are the most common ones.	3.6784244011632397
The present paper describes the deformities and stresses the functional relevance for the patient.	2.7991840014667084
Therapeutic principles of the conservative orthopaedic means are described with special emphasis on the need of an adequate height of the aide and the foot position.	3.6965323746195797
Casting and the application of Botulinun toxine are described having a major side effect of muscle weakening.	3.8118523105063296
A combination of the different procedures, surgical interventions included, need to be selected for each patient offering the best management for each individual problem.	3.673150063345783
Still's disease was originally described as one form of rheumatoid arthritis in children beginning with fever and other systemic symptoms.	3.5850226621234214
In rare cases it may also begin in the adult and is then referred to as adult-onset Still's disease.	3.142771597993721
The diagnostic criteria include typical rash, arthralgias, bouts of fever, and leukocytosis, as well as lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, liver dysfunctions, non-infectious angina, and absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies.	3.240181221101999
We report two adult patients with longstanding disease whose exanthema guided us to the correct diagnosis.	2.91335363954684
The rash is a finding with high sensitivity.	3.7348621255474583
It is characterized by red macules with distinct borders and is evanescent.	2.833815648734254
During an acute flare of the rash, gentle friction induces erythematous, isomorphic (Koebner) phenomena, which, as we describe here for the first time, may persist longer than the remainder of the fleeting rash.	2.961606389048195
Objective: Patients in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) have a high incidence of nosocomial infections which often lead to septic shock and death.	3.4110101714804935
Since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult, it was recommended to obtain routine nose/throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient.	4.157417459566431
Methods: In 1435 patients of our cardio-surgical ICU, routine nose/throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro-organisms and resistance to antibiotics.	2.7882057515346634
Of these 86 patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation, and additional blood cultures were obtained.	3.236482395176508
Antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose/throat swabs, or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative.	3.3028247955095744
Results: Of the 86 patients with systemic inflammation, 29 had blood cultures positive for microbes.	3.2338887574362176
Of these 29 patients, 18 received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose/throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab.	3.4368177852840724
However, in only 11 of the 18 patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes.	3.3247772193798815
While positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response, routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity.	3.7471906831137436
Conclusions: Routine nose/throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22% of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation.	3.372126975911316
In addition, in almost 40% of the cases organisms detected in the routine swabs and blood cultures were not identical.	3.5836401436948933
As a result, we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier, specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients.	2.7334261710335634
The influence of defensivity, measured by validity scales of personality inventories (MMPI-K, FPI-R, GIESSEN-Test) on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in 309 patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy.	2.646055811745605
In general, psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity.	2.862856318093557
25% of patients, who denied psychopathology at admission, did so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up, demonstrating an "especially good outcome" (means).	3.114654369921459
Relative improvement (effect sizes), however, was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales.	3.3355416546243433
- Results are discussed with regard to prior hypotheses about the influence of defensivity.	4.473013238181463
In our study we tested 2 different rapid assays for cardiac troponin t (TropT-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,2 ng/ml and TropTsensitive-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,1 ng/ml) in 75 chest pain patients.	2.574207948942186
Additional to the emergency ECG (3-lead) we acquired a 12-lead ECG.	3.8930988278946663
The TropT-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 11% (specifity 94,3%).	2.8717396014295367
The TropT sensitive-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 62% (specifity 100%).	2.7886695753903434
Despite the great number of publications during the last 10 years concerning the indication, technique and results of operative treatment of acetabular fractures, conservative treatment still has an important role when considering the therapeutic possibilities.	4.119120279174784
Because of the modern techniques of radiological imaging and improvement of diagnostic facilities, a more defined indication for treatment becomes possible.	3.3596688169650544
Conventional X-rays, completed by special projections like the Ala and Obturator view, and a CT scan allow determination of the fracture type (the Letournel/Judet classification or the AO classification).	3.5523215348973953
The most suitable treatment can then be adapted to the individual circumstances of the patient, i. e., age, general condition and overall severity of traumatic impairment.	3.181667736644735
Determination of the intact part of the weight-bearing dome is important in selecting the most adequate therapeutic procedure.	3.4748264605645107
The larger the intact roof arc, the better the prognosis.	3.1972820877059362
Together with the X-ray controls following axial and facultative lateral extentions, the indication for conservative treatment can be confirmed.	3.6710039943953476
Early active motion of the injured limb, followed by walking exercises with partial weight-bearing, are important aspects of nonoperative treatment.	3.778977651574231
Conservative treatment is recommended in non-displaced fractures or in fractures with little displacement, transverse fractures of the lower region or severely comminuted acetabular fractures with no possibility of reconstruction.	3.693904571127392
Our clinical and radiological follow-up of 97 patients with acetabular fractures from the years 1981-1990 showed that the majority were treated conservatively (approx.	3.776003868640205
The functional result after an average observation period of more than 70 months was good or excellent (based on the Merle d'Aubigné score).	3.6235083984849474
We feel it is important to look at operative and conservative treatment of acetabular fractures as two complementary non-competitive therapeutic methods.	3.3376209927111398
The choice of treatment should be based on an exact diagnosis considering fracture type, the individual circumstances of the patient, and application of the necessary diagnostic facilities.	3.9215181187993475
Conservative treatment can lead to excellent long-term results.	3.586576493982829
Problem There is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients.	4.3495574747998145
The literature on these patients reports that mobility, endurance, trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity.	3.209860047123574
Chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons.	3.3077657681598707
Methods Our study group consisted of 90 disabled CLBP patients (44 female, 46 male; average age 42 years) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8-week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support (instruction, endurance training, strength exercises, behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy).	3.112893928939885
Initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons (44 female, 63 male, average age 41 years).	3.0164947260674753
The patients were investigated before and after treatment, and at intervals of 6 and 12 months.	4.422629498929785
The reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison.	3.4732705665424635
Physical assessment included a medical examination (mainly diagnosis of radicular or nonradicular pain), changes in the lumbar spine revealed by X-ray studies according to Herron and Turner [50], rating of physical impairment according to Waddell [117], flexibility, length of hamstrings muscles (SLR), test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the Swiss group of Spring [102] and isokinetic measurements (LIDO Back), tests of lifting capacity (LIDO Lift), and (in part) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer (CASE 15 Marquette).	3.101562404263967
Results Physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced SLR (shortened hamstrings) and decreased spinal mobility.	3.355843988197277
Patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals.	3.5747590081736265
The results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group, whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group.	3.7869839688806213
In principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines.	3.7251844600815014
Cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients.	3.52869013242964
At the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly.	3.3013990122576833
In many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group.	3.2900818124389537
With time, however, training effects gradually decreased.	3.9038791924743212
The success of treatment (return to work, absence from work, pain reduction, use of medical care) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment.	4.5622761575801
Conclusion Study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain.	4.283818274757171
The only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance, in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group.	3.753868352769385
However, even CLBP- patients with long-term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program.	3.290162931169298
Back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy.	3.721353068800935
Because of loss of condition during the time after treatment, regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary.	3.5830184950895294
The dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency-dependent.	3.4771217033643502
To date, this has still not been fully investigated or understood.	2.9248447631956247
There remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution.	3.629563178429859
The presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser-Doppler vibrometry at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens.	3.037285853236128
Motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical equations.	3.0440407739550293
Using a sound stimulus, the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured, and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by Fourier transform.	3.118653120846492
Results were used for verification of the computer models.	3.706442850365799
In the current investigations these models were refined and allow for the detailed investigation of the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain, facilitating the optimal design of passive and active middle-ear implants.	3.1167324705137935
Problem: Postoperative nausea and vomiting remains an important problem.	3.523498524047961
Many risk factors have been identified; however, the importance of postoperative analgesic technique and patient expectation remain poorly defined.	4.023898656000903
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are probably not only unintended, toxic side-products of oxygen metabolism in mammalian cells, they also have several important physiologic functions including antimicrobial killing, regulation of cellular proliferation and growth, and regulation of vascular tone.	2.9948393070908215
ROS are generated within the vessel wall by several mechanisms, including a vascular type of a NAD(P)H oxidase.	3.561116616284889
ROS formation can be stimulated by mechanical stress, environmental factors, the peptide angiotensin II, cytokines, native low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and in the presence of catalytic metal ions.	3.9817290054760313
Their ability to modify LDL, react with endothelial-derived nitric oxide subsequently forming peroxynitrite, and amplify the expression of various genes important for leukocyte recruitment within the arterial wall are the basis of the oxidant injury theory of atherosclerosis.	2.9101836838917836
In animal studies, antioxidant therapy (probucol, butylated hydroxytoluene, N',N'-diphenylendiamide, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase) have been successfully used to prevent fatty streak formation, and to restore impaired nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation.	2.9611176648147115
In man, antioxidant therapy (e.g., supplementation with vitamin E) clearly increased the resistance of LDL to oxidative modification.	2.9231819396792127
Case-controlled and prospective clinical studies suggest a relation between baseline antioxidant plasma levels and/or antioxidant supplementation and risk of cardiovascular events.	3.489033397800898
In one secondary prevention trial (randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled), vitamin E supplementation reduced significantly the risk for non-fatal myocardial infarctions.	3.412939770579043
Before general recommendations can be made, results of further large-scale trials should be awaited.	3.6053316091681062
A 36-year old man suffered an isolated head injury with a fracture of the skull, epidural and subdural hematomas as well as brain contusion (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS): 5 points).	3.747015509794036
The hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.	3.1666887213294364
Because of high intracranial pressure (ICP) a barbiturate coma was necessary.	2.9232096873111204
Additionally, the patient demonstrated acute lung injury (ARDS) due to pneumonia 8 days after trauma.	3.690648088571361
The patient recovered slowly and was transferred to neurorehabilitation on day 57 after injury.	3.052294612880042
During the following 12 months the patient developed a significant deficit of hip motion (extension/flexion: right: 0 °/10 °/20 °, left: 0 °/10 °/30 °; external/internal rotation: right and left: <5 °/0 °/<5 °; abduction/adduction: right: 10 °/0 °/25 °, left: 10 °/0 °/10 °).	3.1796875854223328
X-rays and CT-scanning revealed severe heterotopic ossification (HO) of both hips with ancylosis (Brooker type IV).	2.8525303320097586
Resection of HO was carried out in a two stage procedure using Smith-Petersen approach.	3.2631434936808827
The prophylaxis for recurrence of HO included preoperative single-dose radiation (8 Gy) and postoperative treatment with indomethacin (150 mg per day).	3.476192243565792
The patient revealed 15 (left hip) and 12 (right hip) months after surgery the following range of hip movement: extension/flexion: right: 5 °/0 °/90 °, left: 5 °/0 °/100 °; external/internal rotation: right: 20 °/0 °/30 °, left: 20 °/0 °/20 °; abduction/adduction: right: 30 °/0 °/40 °, left: 30 °/0 °/40 °.	3.1378729453658
No recurrence of HO was observed in x-ray.	4.002350137194476
The patient is able to work in his profession as farmer.	3.773989922441281
Gastric teratomas are rare and mostly benign.	3.60663109258941
A malignant, aggressive solid tumor must be excluded.	3.50613486398682
We present a 6-month-old male infant with a history of bleeding of the upper gastrointestinal tract.	4.109120017747586
After in toto excision the histopathology was that of a benign gastric teratoma.	3.254821820418944
Our method of reading the diagnosis and the subsequent therapy are described.	3.83063595542907
The aim of this prospective study was to assess the clinical and prognostic relevance of patent foramen ovale - in contrast to risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources - in 208 patients with cerebral ischemic events.	3.3451953743097818
All patients underwent neurological examination (Doppler, CT, NMR) as well as transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography.	3.4555235010990666
A patent foramen ovale was found in 75 patients (36%).	4.029185346840249
With regard to risk factors for atherosclerosis patients with closed resp.	3.2857561728404705
Cardioembolic sources showed significant differencies for atrial fibrillation and atrial septal aneurysm.	3.4066194880215646
Multivariate analysis of risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources revealed hypertension and diabetes as age dependant risk factors in patients with closed foramen ovale.	3.263737628044155
In patients with patent foramen ovale the use of oral contraceptives was found as an independant risk factor for cerebral ischemic event.	3.3071051874931046
Patients >60 years with cerebral ischemic events had more often a closed foramen ovale.	3.1627978450042638
Dependant on age patients with closed foramen ovale showed a higher frequency of hypertension and diabetes.	3.629955349527213
In addition these patients revealed more often atrial fibrillation.	3.101647202380617
Patients with patent foramen ovale had fewer risk factors for atherosclerosis or cardioembolic sources but presented more frequent the use of oral contraceptives or atrial septal aneurysm.	3.081438316436347
A retrospective study of 86 motorcycle accidents that occurred in the year 1992 is reported.	3.097638872159832
Examination of the case histories supplemented by telephone conversations yielded the following results: 90.7% of our patients were male and their average age was 28.8 years; the age group between 25 and 30 years was the most frequently involved (27.9%).	3.42749865452438
Most motorcycle accidents happened during weekend trips out in the summertime.	3.011971612936563
Special injury patterns were found for injuries of the upper and the lower extremity.	4.6316197235199645
Injuries of the upper extremity most frequently took the form of fracture of the distal radius (18.8%).	3.804880800013738
The average stay in our hospital was 35.4 days.	3.184664297003678
In 23.4% of cases the patients had to change their job after the accident.	4.0338900938140325
More than half the crashes happened with motorcycles with between 500 and 750 cc stroke volume.	2.582033761304636
Over a third (34.5%) of the patients had held their driving licences for more than 8 years.	3.6659879740812458
A plea is made for more preventive measures, such as better driving instruction, better road conditions and legislative changes, against motorcycle crashes.	3.2333901785322383
From the aspects of cost and the rate of complications it is reasonable to strive for a surgical treatment as soon as possible after the crash.	3.49442504396499
At the moment there is no consensus about the pathogenesis of RSD.	4.445421548785323
In 1942 Paul Sudeck suggested that the signs and symptoms of RSD may be provoked by an exaggerated inflammatory response to injury or operation of an extremity.	3.2727984368403664
His theory found no disciples, as most physicians believe that RSD is initiated by an hyperactive sympathetic system.	3.017750129834124
We performed various clinical and experimental investigations, including the effects of antiinflammatory treatment.	4.046647286989572
The results of these studies support the theory of Paul Sudeck.	2.914254157865341
Erectile failure after radical prostatectomy is a common postoperative disorder.	4.14775434682503
However, nerve-sparing technique provides in about 50-60 % erections sufficient for sexual intercourse.	3.311772265403491
Damage to the cavernous nerves or vascular injuries are responsible for erectile dysfunction.	3.05549616210508
Alprostadil is most commonly used for self-injection monotherapy or in combination with other vasoactive drugs.	4.105337118922367
Intraurethral administration of alprostadil failed to reproduce promising early results.	3.039054469310247
The oral drug Sildenafil showed to be effective in patients with partial erections, however, it failed to work after non nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.	4.083397412700449
Negative pressure devices and penile prosthesis can be considered as alternative therpeutic options.	3.6435779323490056
Autologous N. suralis transplantation during radical prostatectomy might further improve erection rates in the near future.	2.858186680839736
Pregnancy causes substantial changes in the cardiovascular system: cardiac output (40%-50%) and blood volume (40%) increase whereas systemic peripheral resistance and arterial pressure decrease.	3.9047999392523263
The rise in progesterone and estrogen levels accompanying pregnancy stimulates the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system.	2.894215370496051
Increased prostaglandin production follows renin activation; simultaneously, the arterial vessels show diminished angiotension sensitivity.	2.9226535930671598
The result is pronounced vasodilatation.	2.8399474455678333
Heart disease remains the most important nonobstetric cause of maternal death.	3.9243103173610967
The physiological changes in the cardiovascular system during pregnancy influence cardiac diseases in different ways.	2.9833409177156436
Pregnancy, labor, and delivery appear to be well tolerated in gravidae with an atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patents ductus arteriosus.	3.1529113034214045
Sometimes congestive heart failure occurs and appropriate medical therapy is necessary.	3.5143056328836533
Pregnant women with uncorrected cyanotic congenital heart disease (Eisenmenger's syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot) constitute a high-risk group because of right ventricular insufficiency and hypoxic attacks.	3.220418986006381
The consequences for anaesthesia in parturients with congenital heart disease are discussed.	3.325919698117823
The symptoms of acquired mitral or aortic stenosis are aggravated by the physiological changes in the cardiovascular system during pregnancy; the clinical symptoms of valve insufficiency are ameliorated by vasodilatation.	3.0160124013942986
Peripartum cardiomyopathy clinically shows similar features to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	2.9669794512760235
The basis of treatment is the same as that of congestive heart failure, with the therapeutic spectrum ranging from diet to heart transplantation.	4.02193044741186
Women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tolerate pregnancy, labor, and delivery surprisingly well.	2.9995704827148115
Vaginal delivery is possible, but epidural anaesthesia is contraindicated.	3.8246460171766667
Hypertensive disorders associated with pregnancy are classified into three groups: chronic, treatment, and preeclamptic hypertension.	3.4414016766034665
Whereas chronic and transient hypertension do not affect the outcome of pregnancy appreciably, pre-eclampsia presents a potential danger to mother and fetus.	3.15518232259323
Pre-eclamptic hypertension is accompanied by low cardiac output and plasma volume.	3.830788196582799
An upregulation of angiotension receptors enhances vascular reactivity, with the consequence of high peripheral resistance.	3.3984550029628116
For antihypertensive therapy hydralazine, -methyldopa, and magnesium sulfate are the drugs of choice.	3.029972838222459
A generalised recommendation of anaesthesia for the pre-eclamptic gravida cannot be made because both general and epidural anaesthesia have risks of severe side effects.	3.2355620719389715
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaws (DentaScan) is the method of choice for the radiographic assessment of the mandible and maxilla.	4.237060061939888
It is instrumental in delineating the relationship between bony lesions and the adjacent anatomy.	3.439888335295228
Therefore, this technique allows precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.	3.577576988945508
Using it, distinct characterization of pathology including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions can be obtained.	3.199642169059868
The histopathology of bone marrow in primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is described, with reference to the FAB classification.	3.669203214754991
Variants such as hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic MDS are recognized from their histopathology and must be incorporated in the FAB classification.	2.7636841821351923
The clinical significance of hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic variants is illustrated by the survival rates and leukemic transformation in these patients.	2.810447364003651
Histopathological classification according to the FAB system corresponds with cytological classification, as proven by the distribution of the subtypes, blood values, leukemic transformation rates and survival times.	3.507626043037119
A 58-year-old man developed an extensive pilomatrical carcinoma in the left axilla.	3.4455215677852653
Clinically, a squamous cell carcinoma was suspected.	3.6620347393665655
Histological examination revealed the presence of proliferating basaloid cells with many atypical mitoses and mass necrosis infiltrating into the subcutaneous tissue.	3.126589928237578
The tumor was removed by micrographic surgery with a 2 cm safety margin.	3.625707759173079
Histological examination of 2 regional lymph nodes as well as further diagnostic procedures ruled out metastases.	3.7835817712603865
We review the clinical and histopathological differences between pilomatricoma and pilomatrical carcinoma, as well as the published cases of the malignant variant.	4.098533246177874
Introduction: Recent studies evaluating lay people and health care professionals about their process-quality checking the carotid pulse demonstrated poor diagnostic accuracy and more time needed than suggested in international guidelines for CPR.	2.858198969025741
So far there was no scientifically prooved data about the quality of checking the breathing.	3.854067049587534
Study objective was the evaluation of the  effectiveness of checking the breathing in  an emergency situation with four different groups: lay people (L), EMT /Paramedics (E), medical students (M), physicians (P).	3.5384065149683317
Taking into account the increase in worldwide human migration, leprosy is of growing importance in the differential diagnosis of dermatological diseases encountered in Central Europe.	3.038552783734478
We report on the case of a young man from Ghana who developed hypopigmented maculae and plaques on his trunk and proximal limbs.	2.5699660229389245
The diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy could be made in consideration of the histological pattern of infiltrating leucocytes and detection of numerous acid-fast mycobacteria on skin biopsy.	2.968585088227477
The results of the physical examination as well as routine laboratory and immunological parameters were consistent with this form of leprosy.	3.7712392372839822
Due to glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency, treatment with dapsone was contraindicated.	3.1626608114106625
With high-dose rifampicin and clofazimine therapy, the skin changes cleared over the course of 11 months following a leprosy reaction type II (erythema nodosum leprosum) that developed during a phase of discontinued therapy due to low patient compliance.	3.5879462849195134
In the last few years two placebo controlled studies (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Study) analyzed the effect of systemic thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute hemispheric stroke.	2.795338568836959
Both studies showed a positive longtime effect for the rt-PA treated patients.	3.4373269196704794
The number of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was higher in the rt-PA treated groups.	3.3701936840441227
The results determine possible clinical or neuroradiological predictors of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with rt-PA therapy.	2.976614031245186
The role of enteroviral myocardial infection in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy could only be substantiated after the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in-situ hybridization) in virological diagnostics of dilated cardiomyopathy.	3.8488658766440094
By using histological and especially immunohistological techniques for the detection of myocardial inflammation in patients with the tentative clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, a differentiation between inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of the WHO classification 1995 (31) was made.	3.8500991619128895
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis in association with cardiac dysfunction and is diagnosed by established histological and especially immunohistological techniques.	3.3614710815733853
The combination of histological, immunohistological, and molecularbiological techniques enabled a subgroup analysis of the incidence of enteroviral myocardial RNA in patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy in comparison to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	3.6981997236143953
The Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy, until the unity almost unknown in West-Germany, represented the most important form of therapy in the former GDR.	3.5265944581796624
Its development, its conception of the relevant relationship between group-dynamic and psychoanalytic concepts and in particular its reception of psychoanalytic concepts are discussed.	3.123100961907731
This raises the question of defining the position of this therapy form with the focus on the controverse about its proximity to psychoanalytic therapeutical concepts.	3.551733217912862
Even if we take into account that in the GDR there were very reduced possibilities to articulate psychoanalytic and particularly drive concepts, in our view the Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy cannot be considered as a psychoanalytical form of therapy.	3.252008696406686
It represents a specific therapeutical development of the former GDR which is strongly oriented at social norms.	3.541712755365049
It is first of all oriented at the attitude change reached by the group, that means, at the manifest, conscious behaviour of the patient and therefore focusses at the normative level of behaviour regulation in groups in the sense of interactional group therapy.	3.356459502680732
The authors view this form of therapy as a "historical compromise" in the field of psychotherapy under the circumstances of the former GDR and in this way they take into account both its advantages and its weaknesses.	3.5974827073691267
In a prospective study of central fractures of the talus, radiological data (plain radiography, CT, MRI) were scrutinized in terms of correlation with histological findings (biopsy taken at time of screw removal).	3.5040237048626834
The study looked at nine fractures in eight patients aged 14 - 48 years.	3.132327893841062
There was one fracture of Hawkins type I, one fracture of type II, four fractures of type III, and three corpus fractures.	3.6713866022384654
All were operated on within 24 h after injury; seven had screw fixation, two had adaptation with K wires.	3.247262806575944
The patients were kept non-weight-bearing for 14 - 53 weeks.	2.9868498970314197
Duration of follow-up was 2 years or more in all but one patient.	4.207439661283382
In the final radiograph the talus was intact in four patients, while four showed a partial avascular collapse; in one patient, a partial collapse was doubtful.	3.604716782838408
Histology taken 16 - 52 weeks after injury showed osteocyte-free original bone in all cases, with deposition of new bone varying in extent.	3.3674691121569897
Hawkins sign was partially positive in six patients, positive in one, and negative in one.	3.9338306892176607
Decalcification as well as fracture healing can be better followed by CT than by plain radiography.	4.382699693202775
MRI appeared normal in five patients, partially pathological in two, and abnormal in one.	3.5839570241812844
A positive Hawkins sign and normal signal behavior can be seen as prognostically favorable signs.	3.290261287550893
However, in the case of a central talus fracture, even with a favorable course osteonecrosis of at least a part of the talus with gradual replacement by new bone occurred.	3.8969081659193643
Vascularization of the central talus seems to be disturbed more frequently than is reflected radiologically.	4.447040232973975
Purpose: To assess the value of functional magnetic resonance urography for the noninvasive postoperative evaluation of renal transplants.	3.250038125295422
Methods: A saturation inversion projection sequence allows the selective imaging of strongly T 1 weighted signal from the MR contrast agent.	2.820809465429753
A coronal slab leads to images comparable to conventional urography which can be acquired as a sequence with four images per minute.	3.131823346445185
Results: 15 patients with urologic questionable findings after renal transplantation were studied.	3.2325818726653974
FMRU revealed in 6 patients normal findings, in 6 moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis without any urodynamic relevant obstruction.	3.81912930606625
3 pathologic findings, ureteral leak, ureteropelvic-junction obstruction and ureteral stenosis were diagnosed and consequently surgically treated.	3.0151658482083157
The imaging quality in all studies was diagnostic and urologically relevant.	3.344304246372596
Conclusion: FMRU can be used as a noninvasive technique for the assessment of renal transplant in cases with suspicion of complication in the excretory system.	3.913160000391349
The infection after intramedullary nailing is a severe complication, which is hard to eradicate.	3.956602636277944
The results of reaming the intramedullary canal after removal of the infected nail were evaluated in our investigation.	3.49368607278392
From 1984 to 1991 fifty-five patients with infected intramedullary nails of the lower extremity were included in this trial.	3.5876815794969246
Twenty-one patients had an infection of the femur.	3.8659754353615705
Thirty-four patients had a primary infection of the nail, twenty-one patients had multiple operations with periods of infection prior to nailing.	3.7608746666015325
All patients had signs of a chronic osteitis and sinus formation.	3.278165864988663
At the time of the follow-up the success of the procedure was evaluated regarding recurrence of infection, range of motion of the extremity and patient comfort.	4.071892292637352
The mean time of observation was 10,1  +/-  4,9 years.	3.861603263623046
At the time of the follow up all fractures had healed.	3.2585478468258957
85 % of the patients performed full weight bearing.	4.83684879043134
32 patients (91 %) had good or excellent ROM of the adjacent joints.	3.5753831789470687
The discussion about the therapy of the posterior cruciate ligament persists.	4.531642515581009
Conservative treatment, augmented repair, and reconstruction with autografts are discussed.	2.9810915909079587
From 1993 to 1997, 49 patients with posterior cruciate ligament rupture had repair Trevira ligament augmentation of 3 mm.	3.4048227115280465
There were 21 isolated and 28 combined ruptures.	2.91371291910839
In 5 cases bony avulsions were refixed by screw or additional hook plate.	2.6133447624356294
Investigation of 36 patients, in 15 cases with isolated ligamentous ruptures was made.	3.6734114697022027
Osseous avulsion had good results in all cases.	3.816214483929317
Isolated posterior cruciate ligament rupture showed good stability in 7 of 15 cases and instability of 2 + in 8 cases.	3.784561264384995
The medial range Lysholm score was 76.8 (+/- 21.6), the OAK score showed 2 very good and 5 good results, 3 fair and 5 bad results.	3.643254816622763
Using the IKDC score led to 3 very good and 4 good results, 2 fair and 6 bad results.	3.3097532045558733
Using subjective criteria, 10 patients described results as very good or good, 2 fair and 3 bad.	3.476618339396811
We think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft.	4.275501112296007
For this study, data from 24 departments of dermatology (19678 patients) were evaluated retrospectively and separately for 1995 and 1996.	3.772447003055452
With decreasing frequency, nickel, fragrance mix, balsam of peru, and thimerosal yielded positive reactions most often; suprisingly high numbers of positive reactions were also seen with amerchol L-101 and palladium.	2.727801979104153
In men, percentages of positive reactions were markedly lower for nickel, fragrance mix and balsam of peru than in women.	2.786508669959677
Younger patients reacted more often to thimerosal and older ones to topical medical preparations.	2.873822576557245
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in patients with hand eczema.	4.5634391905987215
A comparison of positive reactions obtained in distinct geographical regions was problematic because of differences between test populations.	3.0298858338150048
The spectrum of allergens found in officeworkers was similar to that of the whole test population.	3.3349432949564464
Patients with positive reactions to nickel and fragrance mix had more positive reactions to unrelated allergens than the total test population.	3.0323368191365025
Sex- and age-adjusted frequencies of sensitization revealed a decrease in reactions to nickel and an increase in reactions to mercury allergens from 1995 to 1996.	3.615866882163035
The clinical relevance of mercury reactions was often not apparent.	3.408816965919146
Differentiated lists of allergens can be used to improve the quality of diagnostic and prophylactic procedures in allergic contact dermatitis.	3.8258352390139967
Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (BT) induce a localized, long-lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the BT dose administered and that is free of major side effects.	3.475962811378426
With this profile, BT can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle hyperactivities.	3.586465043758026
These disorders occur frequently in patients in institutions for neurological rehabilitation.	3.4423386149523645
They are difficult to treat with conventional methods, can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system.	3.258306969654795
In the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of BT in rehabilitative neurology.	3.0945724253209566
Regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome, five main indication groups are identified: (1) improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles; (2) relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles; (3) improvement of patient care; (4) avoidance of sequelae in joints, tendons, ligaments, and teeth; (5) various special indications.	4.042771255918262
Myocardial infarction shows a circadian pattern with a maximum in the early morning hours.	3.8460871979870483
In patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), it is assumed that apnea-associated changes of hemodynamics, blood gases, and rheology lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep.	3.6852177928053456
This investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without SRBD.	4.784374666852549
Currently no serological marker for the monitoring of uveal melanoma and its metastases is available.	3.441929038753247
The novel tumorassociated antigen Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is expressed in the uveal melanoma and it's metastatic lesions.	2.836818825449825
Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with shortened action potential duration (APD) and reduced atrial refractoriness.	3.183452055832114
Remodeling of ion currents responsible for AP morphology has been proposed as a major mechanism in persistent AF.	3.1342087705370383
In the present study we investigated the activity of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel and the mRNA transcription of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel subunits in patients with persistent AF compared to patients in sinus rhythm (SR).	3.1081986858897896
Right atrial appendages of 10 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF were used for myocyte isolations to record L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa,L) by the patch-clamp technique.	2.8801587507078947
Right atrial appendages of 16 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF served as sources for determining the mRNA expression of the L-type Ca2+ channel 1c-, 2/-, a-, and b/c-subunits by semiquantitative RT-PCR.	2.762178428879121
ICa,L density was reduced by 70% (p < 0.001) in AF patients compared to the sinus rhythm group.	4.216000867921191
Cell sizes, expressed as cell capacitance, were identical in both groups.	2.797545240162874
mRNA expressions of the 1c-subunit and the b/c-subunits were reduced in AF patients by 18.9% (p < 0.05) and 77.7% (p < 0.005), respectively, while mRNA transcriptions of the 2/- and the a-subunits were not significantly different between SR and AF patients.	3.333789304825496
A decrease in the availability of functional L-type Ca2+ channels in AF patients, due to reduced 1c-subunit and substantial lack of b/c-subunit transcription seems to contribute to the shortening pf APD and refractory periods in AF, thereby favoring increased atrial excitation rate and perpetuation of AF.	3.0477355900664738
34 patients aged 3 months to 20years underwent transcatheter-occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils (Cook).	3.0930793891451764
Eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a Rashkind-occluder; 7 patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition.	3.4862220303556963
Only 6 patients had a large ductus with a diameter between 3 and 4 mm; all had systolic-diastolic murmurs.	3.5450516083461756
The ductus was closed in 24 patients using artrial access only, in 6 patients via a venous, and in 4 patients both via venous and arterial catheterization.	3.912946515963324
One coil was used in 23 patients, 2 coils in 9, and 3 coils in 2 patients.	4.10905044186621
There were no complications of the intervention.	3.102903997257876
Within 24 hours 31 patients (93%) had complete closure of the ductus and 32 patients (94%) after 6 months.	3.4277322579604794
Coil-embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick, safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation.	3.364709448425159
The volume of preoperative screening investigations for outpatient anaesthesia ranges from few, selectively ordered investigations to extensive routine diagnostic procedures.	2.93100457801439
It seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs.	3.472110930441667
The purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient.	4.747796440125745
As shown by a number of studies, preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance.	3.7255707423718825
Abnormal laboratory results in otherwise healthy patients rarely alter the anaesthetic management of the patient and are not related to perioperative complications.	3.9042329742971975
Extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care budgets.	3.0091870979777555
A more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable savings.	2.950821664426404
To achieve costeffective evalulation an efficient organisation of properative assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on-day-of-surgery-cancellations.	3.1806682311272785
The anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary.	4.390971397076718
According to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease.	3.838610444486834
Careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated.	3.273907187841238
The botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst.	3.6058325235554105
The origin of the BOC can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue.	3.3584236324685817
The BOC is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible, as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between 60 and 70 years.	4.866715127465944
Most of the 11 published articles of BOC have shown high rates of recurrence.	2.891893158408368
Histopathologically the BOC is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin, nonkeratinized epithelium.	2.966261490518731
Clusters of glycogen-rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular thickenings of the cyst lining.	3.3291635367484864
For the clinician, the differentiation of the BOC from the keratocyst and ameloblastoma is relevant.	3.1692702720432027
One case of a large BOC (65-year-old male, BOC regio 33-45, diameter 5 cm, radiographically and histologically multilocular) is presented with a review of the literature, including the therapeutic management, and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed.	4.215901825995465
The immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin (CK) 13 implicates the histogenetic origin of the BOC from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands.	3.0000260759141857
The expression of CK 19 and the lack of expression of p53, as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the BOC, may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst.	4.104389315022632
Within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill, we examined 83 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program.	3.37012264736819
The course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3-year period by means of annual follow-up examinations.	4.169488574519867
The sample comprised 44 men and 39 women with an average age of 35 years (SD +/- 8,5).	3.59896104064886
The majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization.	3.6587623956256206
After 3 years, 22% of the patients were integrated into the general labor market, 26% had sheltered employment, 23% were still in work therapy, and 29% were unemployed.	3.88771791902469
Besides the patients' subjective expectations, early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration.	3.4358331296426274
Outpatient work therapy is a contemporary, effective organizational form of sociotherapy.	3.603481988335234
Objective: Based on personal observations the neuromuscular blocking potency of atracurium was supposed to be diminished in purulent intrathoracic diseases.	3.0221874639782507
This hypothesis was tested in a prospective clinical trial.	3.9683939866334033
Aim of study: Goal of this survey is to give an overview of anaesthesia for caesarean section in Germany.	3.679433664689924
Ultrasound contrast agent is used in color Doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels.	3.1825517563832997
We present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained.	4.458848081706139
Up until now, 30 patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus, tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined.	3.7422151603499163
Conventional B-scan sonography was supplemented by non-contrast color Doppler flow imaging.	3.3333511926698285
Depending on the indication, 2.5 g Levovist in bolus or 4 g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of 300 or 400 mg/ml.	3.0526001065756114
The administration of the contrast agent was tolerated by all patients without any side effects and in all cases led to a remarkable enhancement of the Doppler signals.	4.446103557194848
About 15 to 30 s after injection, an enhancement in perfused vessels was detected.	3.148438228707862
The fractioned injection of 4 g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than 10 min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent.	4.038094978682133
The general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83% of the cases.	3.1662642978488305
The lymph-node-supplying vessels were identified in 8 of 11 patients after the injection of contrast media.	4.065065989638552
Additional information, which was gained in 17 patients, increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept.	4.44980824964728
In three cases, the examinations with the signal enhancer resulted in a change in therapy.	3.984208715684094
By applying signal enhancer in color Doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded.	3.416756629419253
Non-syndromic neurosensory recessive deafness (NSRD) is one of the most common human sensory disorders.	3.014469633122762
Mutations in the connexin 26 gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic non-syndromic deafness in different populations.	3.2425098848718155
Laser-induced thermotherapy is an in situ ablation method for the local treatment of liver tumors.	3.628979488868818
The basic prerequisite for induction of adequate treatment volumes for clinical use was the development of a thermostable application system.	3.6966798104589236
In an ex vivo test series, the specially developed application system (diffuser tip) with 5760 J had a higher thermic loading capacity than the Ringmode applicator with 4200 J, thus enabling the induction of significantly larger lesions with a volume of 7.6 cm3.	2.8217680780462677
The results of a further in vivo test series demonstrated that the lesions were subject to a four-phase connective-tissue organization within a 6-month period.	3.4803116637887763
Furthermore, the same laser energy (4200 J) was associated with a significantly lower lesion volume of 2.5 cm3 in the in vivo than in the ex vivo test series.	3.4766620586723436
The influence of liver perfusion on the inducible lesion volume was examined in a further animal experimental study.	3.2473833629345354
By temporarily interrupting hepatic blood perfusion (Pringle's maneuver) during laser application, the effective volume could be increased to 50.3 cm3 (P < 0.01) using an optical beam splitter.	3.027953582320002
These results show that the technical prerequisites for reliable clinical application of laser-induced thermotherapy have been fulfilled.	3.5437403170115123
A total of 222 urogenital specimens were investigated with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction (Amplicor test) for the direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis.	3.0848798133372646
The results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique.	3.027332478829907
Using cell culture a urogenital C. trachomatis infection could be detected in 72 of 222 patients.	3.6464682672716524
The Amplicor test yielded a positive result in 83.	3.2813655102020447
The specificity of both techniques was 100% when the specimens for which neither both nor either one of the tests gave positive results were considered.	3.3459391982432765
In accordance with other studies, this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will supersede cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of C. trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital chamydial infections.	3.4340741259146466
Incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear.	3.684009031663952
Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is characterized as an acute, protein-rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure.	3.9247392421694816
In contrast to NPE, cardiac complications are frequently observed, most consistently in patients with subarachoid hemorrhage.	3.5061023575902186
Typical ECG changes are repolarization abnormalities, similar to those observed in coronary heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias.	4.044488712395076
The CK-MB may be slightly elevated; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left-ventricular function.	3.1071902206628437
Pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis.	3.015834542361871
Cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines.	3.28610072112317
For adequate treatment, close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions.	4.62204573485222
Benign, non-parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or CT scan.	3.2393468860975636
Due to the location of the cyst in the porta hepatis with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma, operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm.	3.416470293283712
This review summarizes briefly pathophysiology, clinical definitions, pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic procedures and principles of therapy and prophylaxis of ischemic stroke.	3.602979634884628
Ischemic stroke is defined as a localized lack of cerebral perfusion mainly due to cardioembolic or arterial-embolic occlusion of cerebral arteries or hemodynamic or microangiographic reduction of cerebral blood flow.	3.2522784966453586
We focused on pathophysiological mechanisms with potential clinical relevance as the role of oxygen and glucose concentration, the therapeutic time window, the role of excitatory neurotransmitters, Ca2+-influx, free radicals, and the development of ischemic brain edema.	4.199924837883473
Based on this data the need of an urgent initiation of diagnostic workup and therapy is emphasized.	3.114126887553506
This includes the early basic management with monitoring of blood pressure, ECG, oxygen and blood glucose concentration, and the balance of the water and electrolyte supply.	4.214826872734241
Since specific therapeutic and prophylactic interventions are based on an exact diagnosis with respect to the pathogenesis, the need of an urgent diagnostic workup including clinical examination, laboratory baseline, vascular ultrasound, cranial CT-scan, ECG, and echocardiography is emphazised.	3.8863490208037574
Based on these results appropriate management of certain pathogenetic stroke subgroups is discussed.	2.619697951847431
New data about the effectiveness of basic care, treatment of edema, neuroprotective agents, and thrombolysis is presented.	3.685977540438566
Indications for the therapy with intravenous heparin, vitamin K-antagonists, antiplatelet drugs, and surgical procedures are summarized.	3.92798166439323
Longitudinal osteocutaneous defects of the sternal region including the caudal third were reconstructed in 15 patients during a 3-year period by using the "vertical (VRAM)- and transverse rectus abdominis muscle" (TRAM) flap.	3.3843940874862324
The majority of the defects resulted from chronic osteomyelitis after previous cardiothoracic surgery or were due to former therapy of breast cancer.	3.003862068804944
Three VRAM/TRAM flaps were primarily transferred as free flaps with microvascular anastomosis in the axilla region.	2.8932204996849102
Nine out of 12 pedicled VRAM or TRAM flaps required an additional microvascular anastomosis because of imminent venous or arterial insufficency ("supercharging").	2.7771843017016278
Therefore, operative technique and operating time of the pedicled and free flap for reconstruction of longitudinal sternal defects are comparable.	3.4208128128004502
Adequate reconstruction and rehabilitation was achieved in 11 cases.	4.206660355278952
In 2 patients revision and partial secondary defect coverage was required.	2.8262778752003164
Two male patients died postoperatively due to their preexisting condition.	3.6692418401974725
The introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections.	2.686798794257016
Lengthening and shortening is achieved by changing the length of the fixator telescope.	3.751535657273369
Axial corrections are performed by additive or subtractive techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures.	3.1183187178753404
Translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal "double angulation".	4.042094716427088
Derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the "ring part" of a hybrid frame.	3.958497051253487
Unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the nintramedullary nail.	3.1843612434438784
Background: Morphological changes in the corneal surface after PRK may result not only in refraction fluctuations and reduction in visual acuity, but also in changes of contrast sensitivity.	3.565957985300981
The aim of this study was to investigate whether PRK has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars.	3.0482554635048937
Calcifying obliterative atherosclerosis isolated within the descending thoracic aorta causing subtotal vascular occlusion was associated with symptoms such as in aortic coarctation in a 56-year-old patient.	3.081928137505154
Remarkable in this unique case is the atypical and isolated manifestation of atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic aorta, as well as the tumorous extent of luminal calcification.	3.409375123811407
Differential diagnostic considerations had to include calcifying tumor of the aorta, remnants after aortitis or secondary calcified aortic dissection.	3.373215271239356
The osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be drainaged permanently or healed through an endonasal access.	3.204932340728671
We review 8 patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique.	3.5248839572067405
The frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision, the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue.	3.5898704413701665
The anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants.	2.879993484082954
All patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ENT-examination and radiological assessment by CT-scan or MRI.	3.1734946495330885
The overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent.	3.1692327485704985
There were no serious complications nor any recurrence.	2.9230584003229794
The cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration.	3.5257871794166715
We present the case of an infant with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, in whom keloids developed at the sites of intracutanous bleeding within 6 months after the illness.	3.153352587961884
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs to the category of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA).	2.9029797610545685
The clinical picture is characterised by progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	2.765484093840828
Other common signs are slow saccades, external ophthalmoplegia, and pyramidal tract signs.	3.0147527918095536
The disease is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene for ataxin 7 on chromosome 3.	3.4745252809745186
SCA7 is a rare disorder.	4.906119251285538
The first case in Germany was described only recently.	3.386976719857685
We report two additional patients, father and son, with the molecular genetic diagnosis of SCA7.	3.298444146835911
The father carries a trinucleotide expansion of 42 CAG repeats, the son 51.	2.948430095172882
Normal alleles range from 7 to 35 CAG repeats.	3.2296082200183833
Both patients show the typical picture with progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	2.933218507979193
We found a pronounced anticipation (earlier disease onset in subsequent generations), which is highly characteristic of CAG repeat disorders.	3.1662347267026405
In the following contribution the under-proportional participation rate of older workers in vocational training is analysized.	2.688882019918817
Regarding the changes concerning the organiszation of vocational training to more job-integrated, self-directed and computerbased learning the consequences for training opportunities, motivation to learn and performance possibilities as well as institutional basic conditions to optimize the participation of elderly workers in further training are discussed.	3.00793916333798
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most severe arbovirus disease transmitted by ticks.	3.4853605942460884
The mortality of the central European form is 0.7-2%.	3.7163733008909103
Active immunisation is recommended for endemic regions.	3.672026945915502
We report on 4 patients with TBE aquired in Middle-Hessen between 1994 and 1997 (2 in 1997).	2.9781864768963886
After repeated CSF and serum testing the TBE-specific antibodies were found in all 4 cases.	3.666742692578565
In one case there was also evidence for a prior infection with borrelia burgdorferi.	3.217014034425911
The results of the initial CSF-analysis were atypical in 2 cases (high cell count of 136 cells/mm3, total protein up to 1.5 g/l).	3.156549984179011
The endemic region for TBE has expanded in northern direction into Middle-Hessen, a region in which Lyme borreliosis is also endemic.	2.8135886960734866
Thus, true double infections are possible.	3.088048911196171
This and the initially frequently atypical CSF-findings make the differential diagnosis difficult.	3.476137612964592
Therefore, repetitive CSF and blood examinations are recommended.	3.3167440872556546
Nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of asthma.	4.207347582473737
Although they are chemically different, there are many similarities in their mechanism of action.	3.4615050799594567
In provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests (allergen, exercise), but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as So2 challenge.	2.9566284790397632
Very few studies compared the two drugs.	3.5492268261491464
In children, only one study was done, showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium.	3.276772071362279
Thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil, the other being proven effect of steroid- sparing, which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium.	3.2320147733845435
Both drugs are recommended as first-line agents in mild persistent asthma.	3.4410021778415287
The evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy-induced benign changes following surgery and/or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology (cCT/MRI) or function (SPECT/PET).	3.274427478567125
Current literature and the present data of our own patients demonstrate the diagnostic efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in the detection of recurrence and in-vivo grading.	3.4002514295773576
Thirty-nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow-up were studied by FDG-PET and IMT-SPECT.	3.4886898020563577
Thirty-four of 39 patients showed recurrences; in 12 cases even a change in the grade of malignancy was observed.	3.5676894916660866
All high-grade recurrences could be confirmed by either methods.	4.15413000781676
IMT-SPECT showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low-grade tumors at recurrence.	3.9426367678162513
In contrast to IMT-SPECT, FDG-PET supports sufficient in-vivo grading.	2.8352798599943836
Both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radionecrosis.	3.943949373631047
In conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade.	3.148343597557253
Histopathology revealed a dystopic papillary carcinoma in a thyroglossal duct cyst.	2.8887646332442505
Worldwide only about 150 cases are known.	3.6434626312300686
We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic procedures employed and included tumor excision, bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy.	3.155341688775436
No abnormalities in the thyroid gland but a metastatic carcinoma was uncovered in an ipsilateral lymph node in the jugular foramen area.	3.469494993495901
A preoperative 99 Tc-thyroid scan and MRI study had not shown any evidence for a malignant tumor.	3.3427786799706434
The therapeutic approach advocated in literature is controversial but the intraoperative findings in our patient supported our decision to choose a relatively radical but not mutilating therapy.	3.1333361288289097
Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) is a pleiotrophic growth factor in carcinogenesis and regulars multiple cell functions.	3.693359215703285
We wanted to evaluate the diagnostic meaning of TGF-1 plasma levels in patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer.	3.5820232640361778
In 242 patients (group I) the blood was taken before any prostate manipulation and biopsy.	3.5875435234228625
The TGF-1 plasma concentrations were almost similar in the group of patients with a prostate cancer (n = 157) and patients with a benign prostate hyperplasia (n = 85; 14 258 pg/ml versus 14 658 pg/ml, SD 10 516 pg/ml).	3.949495897028828
There was no significant difference between the patients with a PSA-progress and without PSA-progress after.	3.3874272972283435
Our results suggest that TGF-1 plasma levels can not be used to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia.	4.014146847114413
The aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria.	3.4097059611054057
Moreover, the patients' motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined.	4.078880912957026
228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies (ins), food intolerance (food), drug hypersensitivities (dru) and urticaria (urt) were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments.	3.0809684500189856
Patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance.	3.3854176247679644
Patient education was the favourite technique for the patients (food 78%, urt 57%, dru 24%, ins 17%), followed by relaxation treatment.	3.673098717197572
The most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self-responsibility, a feeling of helplessness and social limitations.	2.9339889695296013
If strong indication criteria are applied, psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group.	3.7402878949592697
In spite of that, the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support.	3.539661201112898
The definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp.	3.1171740327362634
At present all non-physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors, are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature.	2.942562963202687
Many pesticides or insecticides or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and pollute our surface water.	2.8177474931682087
Here they may cause severe estrogenization of aquatic life.	3.3827006767849355
Only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water.	3.545266930076561
On the other hand, weak estrogens present in plastic ware may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health.	2.496337944344987
On the other hand, many plants produce socalled'hyto-estrogens', particularly soy products are rich in phyto-estrogens but their high consumption in Asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer.	2.6883159246307162
Many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto-estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of climacteric complaints.	3.2576895601840583
Hence, not all endocrine disruptors must be harmful to human health, in fact, some of them (clearly phyto-estrogens) may have beneficial effects.	3.3202501768040733
Counties and states have to adjust the infrastructure of their reportable disease notification systems to meet the demands of the new legislation.	3.236259019809185
An increased demand for human resources at the non-medical staff level is anticipated.	3.3927453372047998
Continuing education programs for medical and non-medical staff at public health offices are mandatory.	3.6156155773754883
Physicians in private practice, hospitals and diagnostic laboratories and leaders of nursing homes are target groups for special information.	3.1150937117575346
A timely review and epidemiological evaluation of all notifications forwarded by county health offices has to be performed at the state level.This is a prerogative for immediate response in case of non-localized increases in reported disease incidence.	3.8104187161561214
The author advocates the development of an epidemiological rapid reaction scheme (epidemiological fire brigade) in which public health physicians at the county, state, and federal level cooperate in a gradual response to outbreak situations according to actual demand.	2.8267972593273436
We report on an 8 year old boy and a 12 year old girl with intermittent peranal loss of blood and mucus, impaired defecation and recurrent abdominal pain.	3.3908827816174116
On endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only, whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically.	3.73488581321846
Biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae.	3.314585918747783
These clinical, endoscopical and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.	2.9990403319710413
Only 26 paediatric cases (age at diagnosis 6-9 years) have been published so far.	4.287247434124738
The interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis (mean: 3,7 years, range: 1 week to 9 years) is remarkably long in childhood cases.	3.4794076618498453
Pathogenetically an internal rectal prolapse with secondary ischemic lesions is assumed.	3.1865599013868695
There is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease.	3.0969127666210037
The ulcers ars often resistant to different medical and surgical options.	3.394167879858132
Discussion: Pediatricians should be aware of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in order to make an earlier diagnosis and to prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and concerns of patients and their parents about more severe illnesses.	3.577496237265382
A typology of chronic illness in childhood and adolescence is developed.	3.3255256150135204
In a comparative analysis of 29 studies, maximal androgen deprivation (MAD) was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation.	3.626370153053495
Thus, MAD cannot be regarded as the new gold standard.	3.3448962828259168
Most trials focus on quality of life which - given the palliative aim of the treatment - deserves special attention.	4.306117921787067
This aspect has not yet been evaluated, however, in the largest multicenter study, Intergroup study 0105.	4.5091471164910955
In patients with advanced bone metastasis or severe pain, MAD treatment should be begun because of the flare phenomenon.	3.8028161198467263
The synergistic effects of LHRH agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated.	3.2846977475637615
Since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum-PSA levels under MAD does not delay progression, the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not MAD should be begun.	3.4532891117020776
A case of generalized maculopapular rash and local indurated plaques following s.c. injections of either low-molecular-weight heparin or conventional (high-molecular-weight) heparin to a 75-year-old woman is reported.	2.808573970230768
This rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed.	3.9147873473379637
Perioperative morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery are mainly due to cardiovascular complications.	3.530440188023835
Therefore, perioperative risk assessment is crucial to avoid these adverse events.	3.498420963098709
In patients above the age of 40 years, the ECG is a basic investigation, often providing hints for cardiovascular diseases.	3.466276435217862
Stress testing and, in special cases, stress echocardiography or scintigraphy (the latter only in those patients, in which exercise is impossible) can detect significant coronary artery disease.	3.4849712093535987
The vascularization reduced the perioperative risk in particular in those patients with unstable angina or severe coronary artery disease.	3.9751282327410906
However, prophylactic revascularization the stable patient does not improve overall outcome, because the risk of the revascularizing procedure must be added to the risk of noncardiac surgery.	3.8598864944447877
Other diagnostic procedures like echocardiography, chest roentgenogram, routine scintigraphy, halter ECG or halter blood pressure measurement do not add information to the perioperative risk assessment, although these techniques might be very relevant in evaluating other coexisting diseases (heart failure; valve lesions, in particular aortic stenoses etc.)	3.198029212767997
and can be useful to improve medical treatment preoperatively (e.g.	3.758261920540179
normalization of blood pressure).	4.52543179034836
A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old woman who had been suffering from interstitial cystitis with Hunner's ulcer for 10 years.	2.8274898387176757
Up to now, only 7 cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis have been reported.	2.8744647937582912
Although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far, the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation.	4.293253460655706
After conservative management had failed, a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed.	2.8993781022297833
The characteristics of interstitial cystitis, verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed.	2.9698803761213832
Introduction: Abdominal actinomycosis is an uncommon disease.	3.73507835918988
Nevertheless it should be considered in case of unclear tumor-like abdominal masses.	4.70759242901841
Methods: We report a case of a 49-year-old patient with an intrauterine device.	3.898300895055703
After sonography, computerized tomography, gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy the preoperative presumptive diagnosis was a carcinoma of the transvers colon invading the abdominal wall.	3.252717566062318
Pathological examination after a right hemicolectomy surprisingly revealed an actinomycosis.	3.1153207538896077
Results: Based on this case diagnostic tools and therapeutic options of actinomycosis of the colon are discussed.	3.845460826094889
Conclusions: This case illustrates the importance to consider the possibility of actinomycosis when finding an unclear abdominal mass.	3.563394698930535
After a surgical excision an abdominal actinomycosis requires antibiotic therapy.	3.0320795101893143
Long-term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenias requires integration of many therapeutic approaches, co-operation of several professions, and regard for the views of patients and relatives.	3.5772490105623254
This review deals with practical aspects of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive resp.	2.812411436637479
psychological treatments, social resp.	3.627154685937126
milieu therapy, rehabilitation, interventions based on the concept of Expressed Emotions (EE), psychoeducation and work with relatives.	3.33758109946403
Continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration.	3.8868745182677564
Indications for adding on antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed, as well as treatment of negative symptoms, depression and management of treatment-resistant symptoms.	3.437400299017497
Psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient.	3.886118713116768
In the context of a stable long-term relationship, the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action.	3.8009484484115656
Effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited.	3.667099169807882
The best results are achieved by social skills training.	2.7934367301643626
Social therapy, which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient, is of paramount importance.	4.435381999301228
Improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long-term social rehabilitation.	3.4442291824522404
Interventions based on the EE concept are highly effective, but are rarely used.	3.7351332607212555
Programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective.	2.934229481333971
The functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained, the integrative role of case-management is stressed.	3.7058017310485907
The effect of a locally applied peppermint oil preparation on tension-type headache was examined in the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study for the first time.	3.188354867725538
The preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and to the corresponding placebo.	3.7501596222589644
The liquid test preparation contained 10 g of peppermint oil and ethanol (90 %) ad 100 (test preparation LI 170, Lichtwer Pharma, Berlin); the placebo was a 90 % ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil were added for blinding purposes.	2.710484910245544
The reference preparation contained 500 mg acetaminophen; the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance.	2.9910019349944394
The study included the analysis of 164 headache attacks of 41 patients of both sexes ranging between 18 and 65 years of age, suffering from tension-type headache in accordance with the IHS classification.	3.3930621412134894
Four headache episodes per patient were treated in a double-blind, randomized crossover design.	3.1840459450426124
Each headache attack was treated by the application of 2 capsules of the oral medication (1000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo) and the cutaneous application of the oil preparation (peppermint oil or placebo solution).	4.00109978443019
The oil was spread largely across forehead and temples which was repeated after 15 and 30 minutes.	3.044783061313804
Using a headache diary, the headache parameters were assessed after 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes.	3.312652679206013
Compared to the application of placebo, a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes (p < 0.01).	2.942202639402887
This significant clinical reduction of the pain intensity continued over the one hour observation period.	3.839548480106449
Acetaminophen, too, proved to be efficient compared to placebo (p < 0.01).	3.480415467464699
There was no significant difference between the efficacy of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution.	2.3367794588900748
Simultaneous application of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution leads to an additive effect which remains below the significance threshold, however.	2.660421676780169
The patients reported no adverse events.	3.0829333414088684
This controlled study showed for the first time that a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution efficiently alleviates tension-type headache.	2.9840557305129685
Peppermint oil thus proves to be a well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative to usual therapies.	4.166040855224349
The positive results of several multi-center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years.	3.3536004980243095
It was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease.	3.2966539644924326
To improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice, a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the German-speaking European countries.	3.8823662253387328
The aim of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge, compare the results of recent clinical trials with the experience from other  therapeutic options and assess their clinical evidence.	3.475559215933782
Dislocated metacarpal V fractures, fixed by percutaneous Kirschner wires or other implants near the metacarpophalangeal joint, often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings.	2.8613863015769083
We therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to Foucher.	2.800031964310927
Twenty-five patients were operated on in a 3-year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined.	3.842632638232843
Six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction.	3.250356450867475
One patient suffering from an early stage of Sudeck's dystrophy was healed, and no other complications appeared.	3.7397095777086093
Three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment.	3.635774802883197
We therefore recommend intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal V fractures.	2.841303202639579
Aspiration of toxic substances, foreign material, bacterially contaminated secretions, or water (near-drowning) either immediately leads to cessation of respiration or to impaired ventilation due to airway obstruction, it causes hypoxia due to surfactant dysfunction, and pulmonary infection might develop.	2.858847516347955
Respiratory insufficiency is the resulting consequence which needs immediate and appropriate therapy and intervention.	3.163599722057269
The knowledge of risk factors that promote aspiration injury is important for its prevention and limitation.	3.4815218977101425
Mortality varies between 3 and 70% depending on patients studied, and on the nature and amount of aspirated material.	3.564116350622492
The major cause of death is acute respiratory failure.	3.0633329739669053
The onset of injury to the lung after aspiration is very rapid.	3.232502777970165
Therefore, therapeutic interventions like bronchoscopy are often too late.	3.070485159914318
More importantly, oxygenation should be monitored continuously for timely institution of mechanical ventilation.	3.2816137255910554
Antibiotics should not be given routinely but a calculated regime is neccessary when signs of infection develop.	3.225822620077908
Prognosis in near-drowning considerably depends on early rescue and successful resuscitation.	3.161879129558451
A rapid onset of cerebral hypothermia during the accident can help to increase the ischemic tolerance of the brain and makes it neccessary to continue advanced life support until rewarming of the near-drowning victim.	3.397789495474522
Anticipation of individual outcome in unconscious patients is difficult.	3.669693352817033
The overall mortality of near-drowning is about 11%.	3.102356790484793
Pathophysiological aspects, diagnostic procedures, pratical management and possible prophylaxis of aspiration injuries will be discussed.	3.274952708081872
Background: Semiquantitative classification of corneal topography after penetrating keratoplasty has the potential for focusing information about the areal dioptric power of the cornea.	3.7530218952543137
The purpose of this study was to objectify the procedure of manual semiquantitative classification using a Fourier transform of corneal topography power data and to correlate both methods.	2.828871581909728
Recently, professional anaesthesiologists organizations, have set up recommendations for intraoperative monitoring.	3.060637333479491
Hypoxaemia appears to be an important pathophysiological mechanism, and this is why oxygen monitoring is given a high priority in safety standards in anaesthesia.	3.6210199520432442
However, no reduction in mortality has been definitively shown to follow the use of any monitoring device in randomized, controlled trials.	3.5793023037880958
Four techniques of oxygen monitoring are discussed and evaluated.	3.706325641255042
Oxygen monitoring during inspiration can be recommended, although its implementation will probably prevent only a few anaesthesia-related deaths.	3.732558434299935
Pulse oximetry is certainly highly recommended, but also has some deficiencies which are not sufficiently well known considering the popularity of this technique.	3.8060545288073997
Transcutaneous PO2 is considered mainly for historical reasons.	3.277109814406196
Near infrared spectrometry is a new technique offering noninvasive and continuous monitoring of intracerebral oxygenation.	3.6758477857017913
The increasing frequency of stent implantation into coronary arteries is based mainly on assumptions.	3.380281604622372
One of these assumptions is that stents may prevent restenosis.	2.8548216916260185
Stents can prevent restenosis as has been shown in two randomized studies (Stress I and Benestent I), but only in large (> 3.0mm) vessels with short denovo lesions.	3.5885419898959383
Despite the very tight selection of patients suitable for stent implantation in these two studies, the advantage for stents remained small (about 10% less restenosis) and appeared to decrease with time following intervention.	3.3221816239628006
There is increasing concern about the extension of stenting in an "unrestricted strategy".	2.8684464808537014
This concern was expressed in the ACC Expert Consensus Document which was published recently (JACC 28, No 3, September 1996: 782-794.	2.878380414488311
Based on the lack of data for most of the presently used stent indications the expert group recommended a more selective strategy for the implantation of stents into coronary arteries.	3.4919199548154967
Removal of the arterial sheath immediately after PTCA is desirable for patients, reduces the medical staff's workload, and may decrease hospital costs due to a shortened length of stay.	3.716184869244387
Although the safety and efficacy of the hemostatic systems used especially for the above purpose have been sufficiently documented, inadvertent intraluminal vascular occlusion is theoretically possible.	2.971934822453783
While partial or complete arterial occlusion in conjunction with the VasoSeal collagen prototype device has been previously reported, similar complications occurring with the Angio-SealTM device were not published.	3.0025526783205074
In this report, we describe a 54-year old female patient (height: 150 cm, weight: 42.5 kg) who was transferred for PTCA following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.	3.1122015054566945
Immediately after PTCA, the Angio-SealTM device was deployed utilizing standard technique.	2.7453676354229533
No difficulties were encountered during device deployment, however, immediately following device placement active arterial bleeding occurred.	3.448381744935743
Due to the inadequacy of hemostasis, heparin was reversed with protamine to avoid further hemorrhagic complications.	2.607253104495783
Following this, the desired hemostasis quickly occurred, but the patient soon complained about symptoms suggestive of an acute occlusion of the right femoral artery.	4.4374847626522005
Unsatisfactory attempts as lysis resulted in the patient being transferred to vascular surgery.	3.6074974108731652
The complete Angio-SealTM system (anchor including collagen) was located intravasculary, and removed during surgery.	2.9439457237631697
Deviations in the axes can be physiological or pathological.	3.1440140922866826
During growth, the axes of the lower extremities undergo significant changes.	3.792732356381125
The femoral neck-shaft-angle decreases from 150 ° on average at birth to 120 ° on average at the end of growth.	3.381089975290684
The lower leg is bowed in a varus direction at birth.	2.9219645799883978
On the basis of an extensive literature search (DIMDI, MEDLINE - status at June 1992), the causes of contact urticaria so far known are displayed in tables.	3.072796069154103
The contact urticariogens can be divided into (1) chemically defined substances and (2) chemically undefined biological materials.	3.84848320639676
The causes most frequently encountered in 16 professions are given.	3.3901694820259745
Numerous agents are known for medical professions (physicians, nurses, dentists and dental technicians, veterinary surgeons).	3.0190430860330673
Today, the most frequent single cause of contact urticaria is probably the presence of latex proteins in rubber (gloves, condoms, tubes, balloons, etc.).	3.305031262930795
When testing is performed a stepwise approach is recommended for safety reasons (rub test, prick test, scratch chamber test).	3.113858635013106
For some contact urticariogens a commercial radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is available.	2.8503664992916034
In the cases reported in the literature it is not always possible to decide definitely whether the pathogenetic mechanism was immunologic (IgE mediated) or non-immunologic (toxic or pseudoallergic).	3.440704611177964
When there is a high degree of sensitization (e.g.	3.0983053369958884
to latex) professional activities must be severely restricted, or even completely discontinued in rare cases.	3.126515800682791
Purpose: To find and describe potential MRI criteria of nutrient vessel canals of carpal bones.	2.7550427179308827
2-Agonists are being used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine because of their antihypertensive, analgesic and sedative properties.	3.4951781028446094
Platelets bear 2-receptors on the cell surface.	3.5383392676825896
The present study examined whether in vitro incubation of blood with the 2-agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine decreases 2-receptor density and hereby influences platelet aggregation.	2.959956276054549
Prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians.	4.004279613067245
Acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain.	3.7454823387152922
The basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia, the clinical symptoms, the diagnostic tools and the preclinically available therapeutic options.	4.45406691745216
Time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30-60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in 3 to 6 hours.	3.6456288850160425
With 30% of patients dying within the first hour of ischemia mostly due to ventricular arrhyhtmias every effort needs to be made to shorten the delay between symptom onset and start of reperfusion therapy.	3.6362563690730796
The present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of preclincial diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or PTCA.	3.6340965656022686
The aim of surgical intervention in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the achievement of normocalcemia and euparathyreosis.	3.8147375506096006
Despite improved diagnostic procedures containing comparatively modified pre- and intraoperative methods to determine the position of the parathyroid glands and the most efficient operative technique including minimal-invasive surgery thereof, success cannot be guaranteed.	3.5409582155695345
Therefore, we should strive to avoid reintervention by ensuring a hemorrhage-free, atraumatic, anatomical-orientated operation and providing positive preconditions for reoperation.	2.7715697647916135
Success is based on the four pillars of the HPT surgery: history, embryology with anatomy, neck surgery and experience.	3.2981615029695384
By means of this principle and the results of surgical treatment in 1634 patients with pHPT from 1982 until 1998, we demonstrate a standardized operative technique of pHPT.	3.294443727601685
A 67-year-old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome.	3.638710203098763
Biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary glo-merulopathy on light and electron micros-copy.	3.058113688141639
Other non-nephritic causes of a nephrotic syndrome (e.g.	2.7830083316734866
amyloidosis, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, light-chain glomerulopathy, cryoglobulinaemia, collagen-III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy) could be excluded.	3.0693027681960485
Besides the case report, differential diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulopathies is presented.	4.133835473495482
Two patients were infected with sporotrichosis; one had the fixed cutaneous form, the other the lymphocutaneous form.	3.109662549915286
Sporotrichosis schenckii was identified in both with a culture from a tissue biopsy.	3.4262647507123787
Both patients were successfully treated with itraconazole, one received 100 mg and the other 200 mg itraconazole daily over a 3 months period.	3.2813174477302183
Abstract   Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent that has recently been shown to be effective in ameliorating disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) as indicated by clinical and MRI data.	3.1362638263674656
However, the role of mitoxantrone in escalating treatment of patients with frequent and severe relapses and with rapid progression of disability is less clear.	3.4497423829161824
In this retrospective analysis we report on 15 patients with severe relapsing-remitting (9 patients) and secondary progressive MS with superimposed exacerbations (6 patients) treated openlabeled with mitoxantrone in our Clinical Research Group from July 1994 to October 1998.	3.3008271089880528
Eleven of these patients (73%) were treated with azathioprine, interferon-beta-1b or cyclophosphamide before.	4.374415137825637
The patients received mitoxantrone over a period of at least 12 months (19 +/- 6 months) with a single dose of 10 mg/m2 monthly for the first three months.	4.7779296613534905
Thereafter, infusions were repeated every 3 months (total dose 141 mg +/- 45 mg).	3.267689783113594
The annual relapse rate could be significantly reduced from 3,0 +/- 1,5 in the year before therapy to 0,5 +/- 0,5 during therapy.	4.003725397225099
Nine patients (60%) were stabilised, while four patients (27%) showed an improvement of disability.	3.7883950367266963
The treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects.	2.8760372993230576
These results although retrospectively obtained confirm previous trials showing that mitoxantrone may be useful in MS patients with frequent and severe exacerbations and/or a rapidly progressive course of the disease who have had other immunomodulatory medication.	3.482803343487105
Interstitial cystitis (IC) represents a rare and complex inflammatory bladder condition in which diagnostics can be challenging.	3.2364551142689764
Strict NIH criteria for its diagnosis were designed for research purposes.	3.4585947154933407
Their routine application would miss large proportions of IC patients.	3.0868443249453623
When IC is suspected, history and physical exam are followed by an evaluation of long-term voiding diaries.	4.109134432313207
Large voided volumes (functional capacity >250 cc) or longer micturition intervals (>2 h.), absence of nocturia or symptom-free periods reduce the likelihood of IC.	3.1311453443669492
Further exclusion diagnostics include urine tests (infection), cytology (in-situ carcinoma), ultrasound (calculi, bulks, anomalies) and urodynamics in selected cases.	2.7922523224108255
Bladder capacity measurements under sedoanalgesia are of limited value, since functional low-volume bladders can be mechanically extendable.	2.9417324415278037
Cystoscopy under general anesthesia represents the diagnostic standard procedure for IC during which 90% of IC-patients present with characteristic mucosal glomerulations after bladder distension.	3.13716787616592
Biopsies are recommended for exclusion of malignancy.	3.8582387263682096
Potassium-leak testing plays no relevant role in routine diagnostics due to its poor sensitivity.	3.294140417334621
Similarly, complex determinations of novel IC markers (histamine, tryptase, cytokines, growth factors, substance P, nitric oxide) are of no relevance in clinical settings and should be restricted to research projects.	3.3598112752979605
According to semiotics, which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of signs, objects, and interpretants, pain is considered to be a sign (significant) with very different meanings (significance) either as a naturalistic symptom (of disease) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context.	3.340970275111582
When following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms.	3.705964079563061
In Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body.	3.478829237136242
Especially in the Corpus Hippocraticum dating from the 5th and 4th century B. C. this materialistic and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed.	2.6240643153787477
Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception.	3.0106054372888678
It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor).	3.0278013437843416
He also coined the term µK to characterize an attack of migraine.	2.917437977412359
On the other hand, pain was designed as a multi-dimensional symbol by the famous Graeco-Roman epic poets.	2.783296014082155
In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B. C.), pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the hero's leg like an identification tag, whereas in Virgil's Aeneids (1st century B. C.) pain symbolizes weakness and defencelessness which can only be alleviated by the goddess Venus.	2.686201377849393
In this article current indications and limitations of neuromuscular monitoring are reviewed.	3.1810276361525758
Attention is mainly focused on detection of residual curarisation.	3.120470882718836
New insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed.	3.3551804858169993
Surprisingly in this context, despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring, its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine.	4.176277403260188
A lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring.	3.5956773405177103
Three patients presented with an acquired green discoloration of their scalp hair.	3.3335046179576264
History revealed that all of them swam regularly in private swimming pools.	3.1043610102392982
Examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed that the green discoloration was caused by an excessively high copper content of the hair.	3.8558327235470014
This exogeneous discoloration is characteristically related to the uptake of copper from private swimming pools.	3.1360119882103232
A 62-year-old female patient presented with bullous, intensely itching cutaneous lesions, which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease).	2.8869536850525863
Therapy with DADPS was unsuccessful.	2.9929392406796804
Because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly, a lymph node biopsy was taken.	3.2332703164289356
Histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis: angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-type T-cell lymphoma.	3.814715842663327
Intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma.	3.1689532770312137
These skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations.	3.7395672071175086
This case report is the first report of AILD with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature.	3.2052764473008164
Background: The procedures for prophylaxis and treatment of keratopathy following facial palsy with lagophthalmos are unsatisfying from the functional point of view.	2.9561559495944474
The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0.2-T MRI unit and a 1.0-T MRI unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament.	3.5271130169152456
Twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent MRI of the knee on both 0.2-T and 1.0-T MRI units.	3.97340834491005
Three independent observers evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.	3.7703245157505787
Frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities, and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic.	3.1457898211463733
Sixteen of 24 patients had signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament on the 1.0-T unit; the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 15/16 (93 %) patients and secondary signs in 7/12 (43 %) patients.	3.142480554265349
In 8 patients the 1.0 T unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament; in these patients the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 1/8 cases (12 %), and secondary signs in 3/8 cases (37 %).	3.498662586879037
Observer agreement was very good for the 1.0-T unit and fair for the 0.2-T unit.	3.1849581006835517
There is no substantial difference between 1.0-T units and 0.2-T MRI units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament.	2.8629249875247234
In the visualisation of secondary signs, 1.0-T units are superior to 0.2-T units, and there is a surprisingly high rate of false-positive results with the 0.2-T unit.	3.9771121586184504
As to the reproducibility of the results, the 1.0-T unit is far superior to the 0.2-T unit.	3.675603498425768
Purpose of our study was to develop a reliable model to define clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) being at low risk and at high risk for occult retroperitoneal metastases based on pathohistological and immunohistochemical parameters in order to stratify the therapeutic approach.	3.579617197633888
3-5 paraffin-embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks of 149 clinical stage I NSGCT were available from all patients and were analyzed for histopathological features associated with pathological stage: presence/absence of vascular invasion, presence/absence of tunical invasion, percentage of each histological cell type present in the primary tumor.	3.254084527294912
Immunohistochemical expression of MIB-1, p53, bcl-2, cathepsin D and e-cadherin was evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring ystem.	2.9751519381328775
Statistical analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.	3.1840339889939546
Percentage of embryonal carcinoma [%EC (p < 0.001)] and presence of vascular invasion [VI (p < 0.0001)] were the most significant independent risk factors associated with pathological stage II disease.	3.753938945095833
Combination of %EC and VI allowed correct prediction of final pathological stage in 88 % of patients.	3.1423490226166995
Cut-off values including both variables identified correct pathological stage in 131/149 patients (88 %).	3.1623485510480274
Less than 45 % EC and absence of VI correctly identified pathological stage I disease in 91.5 %; more than 80 % EC and presence of VI correctly predicted pathological stage II in 88 % of the patients.	3.2500215805969117
%EC and presence/absence of VI appear to be reliable prognosticators to identify both patients at high risk and at low risk for occult retroperitoneal disease.	3.680398017217858
P53, bcl-2, MIB-1, cathepsin D and e-cadherin did not appear to be of prognostic value in clinical stage I NSGCT.	3.2385501271461967
In the framework of rheumatic illnesses, the lungs and pleura are often observed to be involved.	3.5517089547567493
Dependent on the basic illness in question, conditions of the bronchoalveolar system, vessels, lymphatic system, and pleura that have developed differently inter- and intraindividually can be diagnosed in toporegionally variable forms and combinations.	3.1838409672361228
In the causal pathogenesis, the initial (auto-)immunological alteration of the alveolar septa plays a role.	3.4787373886945008
When the monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts are activated, as a result of a chronic inflammatory process there is increasing reparative proliferation, which finally leads to the nonspecific end stage of irreversible interstitial fibrosis.	3.4255169379494577
The incidence and manifestation forms of lung changes show certain differences dependent on the underyling illness (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic scleroderma, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, Sjögren syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease).	3.0323870298842537
In addition to vasculitis and granulomatosis of the lung, therapy-induced lung changes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis since almost all basic therapeutic agents can cause this type of lung condition.	3.4774115467698676
Good knowledge of the parameters from the viewpoint of possible therapeutic measures is indispensable, as is close cooperation between the treating physician and the pathologist.	3.7189472600980094
Scintigraphic imaging identifies pathophysiological processes; in other words it assesses regional perfusion, permeability, leukocytic accumulation and bone turnover.	3.0388287994596266
These processes precede morphological changes and this accounts for the high sensitivity of nuclear medicine procedures as well as the low specificity for the differential diagnosis of different diseases with similar pathophysiological characteristics.	3.904882099915567
This review (1) describes and evaluates the currently used scintigraphic procedures, (2) suggests their differential use in certain clinical settings in comparison with alternative radiological methods and (3) addresses new developments in diagnosis using nuclear medicine procedures.	3.633186816990098
In summary, we advise dynamic bone scanning as a primary scintigraphic investigation.	2.9703900766983917
A negative scan excludes osteomyelitis in most cases.	3.196696714406844
The comparison is made with conventional radiology and clinical history.	3.3237367169409904
In cases with short clinical histories ( = granulocytic inflammation), leukocyte scintigraphy should be the next diagnostic step; in chronic processes (lymphomonocytic inflammation), gallium scintigraphy is advisable.	3.0061385721846077
Other scintigraphic methods might be of additional use in experienced hands.	3.4608437949163835
SPECT is useful for clarifying inconclusive planar scans of the head, spine and large joints.	3.6418342561236767
To assess the clinical effectiveness of glaucoma therapy with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation, 106 eyes (51 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma, 22 eyes with secondary glaucoma, 10 eyes with narrow-angle glaucoma, 23 eyes with other glaucomas) of 87 patients were treated.	2.8996812599856487
Using a diode laser coupled with a fiberoptic probe, ending in a focusing tip, all eyes were treated with 24-30 spots over 360  ° and 2.8-3.6 J of energy, 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus.	2.982370271180381
The intraocular pressure was obtained over a period of time until 8-24 months after operation.	4.312617120446691
Additionally, morphological changes of the ciliary body were observed in 25 eyes by means of ultrasound biomicroscopy.	4.198878803061557
Our objective was to determine the efficacy of ESWL treatment in children and the extent of auxiliary measures.	5.260006793809384
In a retrospective analysis we investigated number of auxiliary measures and the stone-free rate in children after ESWL treatment.	2.7956565173650083
We report a 44-year-old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures.	4.077821720962648
Histology revealed the diagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma.	4.388669994694897
This tumor represents a special entity of nephroblastoma that rarely occurs in adults.	2.802371253706082
There is no unanimous opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor behaves differently.	2.7440277407898117
The question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open.	3.3218637307844654
The decision depends on the given case.	3.802206537649247
Nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue.	3.8865972857235005
The safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows fingerlike spread into the surrounding tissue.	2.9630142176775824
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is a non-invasive method of recording quantitative data from gas exchange and ventilation for the evaluation of oxidative metabolism at rest and during exercise.	3.6549441669791607
An incremental exercise test measuring gas exchange, ventilation and lactate release was performed in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders.	4.197356260073635
At rest as well as during exercise patients with mitochondrial disorders differ from healthy subjects with regard to gas exchange and ventilation parameters.	4.019591161708432
During exercise, the decreased oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle and early activation of anaerobic metabolism in these patients are mirrored by a reduced anaerobic threshold, reduced maximal oxygen uptake and reduced oxygen pulse.	3.332863816688767
Our study shows that CPX is a sensitive and practical clinical screening method of investigating mitochondrial disorders.	2.937892855154439
Monitoring of pH of the esophagus is a routine diagnostic procedure, whereas until now pH-monitoring of the hypopharynx has been used only for scientific research.	3.627473682956649
In the present study a critical evaluation scale was used to record the results of 112 patients who underwent pH monitoring to determine possible reflux.	4.0996322841936115
Since high refluxes often remain unnoticed clinically, further study is required in certain cases.	3.44637622280649
The extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx.	3.206692635171028
In such cases 24-h pH monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of "gastric laryngitis".	3.6043050760610083
The occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes.	3.342623009709426
In babies and infants, these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia.	3.1840344941267698
Viral infections and/or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults (adult giant cell hepatitis, AGCH), which is much rarer.	3.83214434897786
In some of the cases, there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses.	3.5158405725244384
Giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of HIV infection.	4.528550493541368
These both indicate an infectious cause.	3.256221742884927
However, the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees.	3.1700329658446544
Apart from our case, only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis A infection could be demonstrated serologically.	4.35141743094362
In addition, the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient.	2.987740260234694
This autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient, especially since a hepatitis A infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here.	3.394060969472995
In patients with a significant elongation of the ACL we propose a new therapeutic regimen.	3.936052516361371
After mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the ACL we pull the bone block with the attached ACL distally.	3.0552156633378567
Thus the ACL is easily tightened.	3.2287784477683914
In accordance with this method, we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the ACL: the tibial insertion is mobilised, the bone block with the attached ACL removed from the joint.	4.4888624530946455
Ex vivo sutures are placed into the ACL, the ligament is pulled back into the joint, and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block.	4.204064972499751
Methods: In a retrospective study, 60 couples, members of a self-help organization, were studied at the average of 5 years (2-215 months) after their loss.	3.615122085021396
Depression, anxiety, physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires.	3.3602744827569153
A community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls.	3.402118985918922
Results: Average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample.	3.7714848892749835
Men and women coped differently with the loss: Bereft mothers were more depressed and ruminated more about cause and preventability of the death than fathers.	2.870775540963017
They expressed their grief more openly and found it more helpful to speak about their loss.	2.779697292736135
The presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss; an early subsequent pregnancy was fraught with increased anxiety.	2.9100737767110547
Conclusions: The self-help group serves an important function as a coping resource; the pediatrician plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families.	3.371308049662711
A 63-year-old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine.	2.9185624459825537
This reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema.	3.507457045632214
We discuss the signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine-induced livedo reticularis.	3.4194420188206642
Despite the diagnostic criteria of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, the term borderline has been used in a non-specific way for a long time.	4.1314145141845975
For our investigation we constructed a questionnaire, which contained the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder (BPD), plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder.	3.690798006447099
800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria, which they thought were typical for the BPD.	3.499874624013834
By using the operational diagnostic approach for ICD-10 and DSM-IV a disorder was diagnosed from each of the 162 received questionnaires based on the marked criteria.	3.4213941133596535
92,0% of the questionnaires contained marked criteria for the diagnosis of the BPD by ICD-10 and 96,3% by DSM-IV.	3.5020388041898336
In addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis.	2.949302148682774
This is a sign for the difficulty to separate the BPD from other personalitiy disorders or the schizotype  disorder by using operationalised criteria.	3.004425686748862
Looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality  disorders, e.g.	3.1279945690074547
for the BPD which has been discussed by many authors for years, modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered.	4.164467163376166
Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior.	4.021569981419033
The efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has been questioned.	2.8121809047323967
Opened and controlled investigations have shown risperidone is effective for reducing self-injurious behaviour in mentally retardation.	3.2307478169296835
We report about 3 mentally retarded patients which were given open-label riperidone for 12 weeks.They participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the repititive behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule (DAS).	2.7796868203356944
Purpose: To test the capabilities of vacuum core biopsy (VCB) in the diagnosis of mammographically indeterminate lesions.	3.458846424111412
Materials and Methods: 120 patients (131 lesions) were examined using VCB with 14G or 11G vacuum core.	3.11168942466389
Radiologic information systems (RIS) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are becoming increasingly widespread.	3.05212679264804
This leads to new demands on the integration of the individual, formerly independent information systems (RIS, modalities, PACS).	3.3459682485699163
Possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced.	2.8145172671438936
Besides the detailed description of different realizations of system communication, its role in the PACS at the university hospital in Freiburg is explained.	3.18376245461919
The integration of different information systems still requires the use of proprietary interfaces.	3.882303366151889
An appropriate integration generally has been realized in Freiburg.	3.1270353846769425
In the near future DICOM basic worklist management will standardize system integration and render an interdepartmental workflow concept possible.	2.6912692234597158
Even though an available communication standard exists, not all problems in the RIS-modality interface are solved.	3.040960976136464
Different data models in the various RI systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard.	3.0449673967533206
Thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard.	3.0412195832757036
Background: Denecke developed 1957 a surgical strategy consisting of three or four operative steps for rehabilitation of patients with unilateral paralysis of IXth and Xth cranial nerve.	3.2964608405599956
These four steps are the following: myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle, resection of the paralyzed pharyngeal wall, medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord and fixation of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall which can be facultative.	3.6528736223550458
Reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient.	3.543536876528614
Methods of navel reconstruction are found in the literature but do not provide an elegant solution to the problem.	4.199419811649341
Our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure, by creation of two opposing trapezoidal skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body; the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the linea alba.	3.0389972327032764
Reconstruction has been successfully carried out in this way after melanoma excision in 7 patients.	3.614183727085357
Mammography is an established diagnostic procedure for breast cancer.	3.8936793726973495
Data concerning screening mammography are available from nine prospectively controlled trials, the largest series being presented from Sweden.	3.1367850077744333
Mammographic screening leads to a significant reduction of breast cancer of 30 % in women ages 50-59 years.	3.919124955892799
In younger women (40-49 years) the benefit accounts to only 20 % and has not proven to be statistically significant.	3.609937862560386
Nevertheless, the major advantage of mammographic screening is detection of the non-palpable tumor <= 10 mm in size.	3.7602493958511714
The treatment of these small breast carcinomas leads to long-term survival rates of >= 90 %.	3.8552535961086547
Mammographic screening programs have been introduced in the USA, Canada, Iceland and Sweden for women in their 5th decade of life.	3.112822644039845
Starting yearly lifelong mammography-screening at the age of 40, the theoretical cancer induction by radiation exposure does not exceed 0.1 %.	3.0587189843587574
Under highly qualified conditions, it should be possible to minimize false-positive and false-negative screening results.	3.3873675433703174
In Germany, screening-mammography is only introduced in patients at high risk for breast cancer.	3.3533829395029437
Based on medical data, mammography must be a part of screening for women with an average risk - starting at the age of 40, although there are still open questions needing further clinical research.	3.4131381976689963
Upper lid closure in facial nerve paresis induced lagophthalmos is often improved by implantation of gold weights.	3.111404616107903
However, the tolerability of gold implants has not always met expectations.	2.8022613824622864
We therefore investigated whether results could be improved by implantation of well-tolerated platinum implants.	3.2439753887402807
Methods to determine the mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures are valuable tools in wound healing research.	3.307137166243406
So far standardized testing procedures have not been defined in the surgical literature, which reduces the comparability of results from different authors.	3.641162861442811
Therefore we suggest a modified tensile testing procedure which follows German industrial standards (DIN 53 455).	2.7076482810491105
The experimental set-up includes an universal testing machine and special clamps.	2.9038634736233147
The dumbbell-shaped specimen consist of freshly prepared pig skin and the suture which is to be tested.	3.3624923486472493
Well-known mechanical properties of surgical sutures and wounds were used to approve the precision of the experimental set-up.	3.3756735935948283
Reproducible analysis of all tested sutures and wounds (n = 120) was possible.	3.565703949885573
We recommend testing procedures adapted to industrial standards to obtain comparable results in determination of mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures.	2.7238006484182042
Abstract  An infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to a large variety of complications affecting almost every organ system.	3.299395638351647
With the increasing numbers of HIV infections, some authors have reported an occasional association between an infection with HIV and arterial aneurysm.	3.2231526288454395
However, complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare.	3.250425491204453
Partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance.	3.025280057183904
It may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation.	3.199605703099856
Although this is well established, nasogastric tubes are commonly used, because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure.	3.5112462357302663
A new technique for fixing orogastric tubes was tested in a prospective study in 11 preterm and term infants over a 4 weeks period.	3.222432972053644
There was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in 7 patients.	2.9926598684315295
The orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in 3 patients and only 1 patiend aged 15 weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube.	3.553193230388807
On the basis of a 3 days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86,2% for all patients and 92,5% for patients below 8 weeks of age.	3.3164743534710106
Mesenchymal neoplasms of lipogenic differentiation are the most common soft-tissue neoplasms in adults.	3.9106274633567075
In recent years a number of "new" entities and variants have been described.	3.4902257266806656
Their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy.	3.2251065743078624
Chondroid lipoma, myolipoma, and purely cutaneous spindle-cell/pleomorphic lipoma are biologically benign neoplasms which may mimic sarcomas morphologically.	2.9025960145196184
Despite high-grade morphology cutaneous liposarcomas carry a favorable clinical prognosis.	3.3314779046185934
Spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour (well-differentiated liposarcoma) and must be distinguished from dedifferentiated liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma.	3.361922790559706
The advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes.	3.261030602101668
The intracranial space is divided into two large compartments by the tentorium.	3.568383564518836
The hydrostatic pressure of spinal fluid is responsible for buoyancy of the brain within these compartments.	3.6204206852544227
In patients with craniectomy this equilibrium is exposed to atmospheric pressure.	2.8591358307581216
We report on four cases of reversible herniation after either bilateral or unilateral decompressive craniectomy performed for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and failure of conservative ICP treatment.	2.7452048579170594
All four patients had survived a severe neurological disease (encephalitis, subdural haematoma, stroke) which required craniectomy to control raised ICP.	2.867778506860818
All were successfully weaned from the ventilator and awake and CT scans showed no space-occupying lesion anymore.	3.14737361223825
The patients showed a typical "sunken pattern" at the trepanation site.	3.1182265427432023
All patients developed clinical signs of transtentorial herniation (i.e.	2.77646839688407
unilateral dilated pupils, deteriorated alertness, and extensor posturing) shortly after either diagnostic or presumed therapeutic lumbar puncture.	2.8035215684750736
One patient developed herniation a second time while in the typical 30 ° upright position.	2.99245116055386
After craniectomy, transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased ICP.	3.8723550290850324
It is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure, which is enhanced by changes in the CSF compartment following lumbar puncture.	3.755563285503206
Acute therapy in these cases is quite simple; it requires flat or even head-down positioning and early cranioplasty.	3.357916755167831
Diseases of the oral cavity, floor of the mouth, and nervous system can be accompanied by disturbances in tongue movement during swallowing.	2.891204722226702
These disturbances can be diagnosed by videosonography whereby the examiner has to evaluate extensive video documentation of lingual motion.	3.3026555382629055
It was the aim of this study to facilitate this evaluation by the application of a reproducible computer-assisted quantitative analysis procedure.	3.4213189750497497
Video sequences of 56 healthy adults and 19 patients with dysphagias of different etiologies were analysed.	3.5494010842522874
A numerical estimation of swallowing movements was carried out in abstraction from the structures imaged (bolus, air, muscles of the tongue, floor of the mouth, hyoid, etc.).	2.8811498775003725
Intensity changes of the pixels within previously defined radial image sectors were quantified in relationship to time and depicted as sector curves.	3.084094597210466
The healthy adults demonstrated a characteristic pattern of two motion maxima that appeared within almost all sector curves.	2.879476715944586
These maxima represented bolus transport movements and the reset movement of the tongue.	3.251602242473282
Patients with diseases of the tongue or neuromuscular changes caused by disturbances of the central nervous system showed pathological deviations on videosonography.	3.6760290489542244
These appeared as local or general reductions in movement, slow speed motions, repetitive swallowing or unsorted additional movements of the tongue during swallowing.	3.0313617868860216
Clinically-used ketamine is a racemic mixture of two isomers, S-(+)- and R-(-)-ketamine.	2.873057832519767
Previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of S-(+)-ketamine to be three times higher than that of R-(-)-ketamine.	3.0101044487139013
It was the aim of this study to compare the effects of S-(+)-ketamine and racemic ketamine on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, recovery, and side effects in geriatric patients during total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) for orthopaedic surgery.	3.083676148227011
Forty patients over 60 years of age scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement were investigated in a double-blind, randomised design.	3.6221938682040995
For induction of TIVA, patients received 0.1 mg midazolam, 0.5 mg atropine, 1 mg/kg S(+)-ketamine or 2 mg/kg racemic ketamine, respectively, 2 mg vecuronium, and 1.5 mg/kg suxamethonium.	3.823680340208839
After intubation and relaxation with a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg per hour S-(+)- or 4 mg/kg per hour racemic ketamine was administered throughout surgery.	3.6626431997018685
In addition, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation were measured, and the time intervals between the end of ketamine infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were protocolled.	3.791641371585451
The incidence and assessment of dreams and other side effects were reported by the patients.	3.5455910416264147
Biometric data of the groups were comparable, the mean age of both groups being 68 years.	4.488833920316444
Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, ADH, ACTH, cortisol, and glucose as well as SAP and HR increased significantly (P<0.05) during the course of anaesthesia.	3.8264110203577557
The influence on lactate levels was not significant.	3.2825688930352754
There were no differences between S-(+)- and racemic ketamine with respect to these parameters.	3.2282791297699194
Three patients in the ketamine-racemate group showed severe arterial hypertension and were withdrawn from the study.	3.4800234294594787
Recovery clearly improved after administration of S-(+)-ketamine compared to the racemate.	3.851221967962769
Simple orders were followed after 2.0 +/- 3.4 versus 4.9 +/- 6.8 min (P=0.07), orientation with respect to person returned after 5.7 +/- 4.0 versus 14.6 +/- 10.0 min (P<0.001) and spatial orientation after 8.2 +/- 5.4 versus 17.4 +/- 9.7 min (P<0.001).	3.027978651205967
After racemic ketamine, 1 patient remembered a negative dream and 1 patient a positive dream.	3.555516636990493
In the S-(+)-group, 1 positive dream was reported.	3.4259232821559196
No intraoperative awareness was reported, and all patients would accept the same anaesthesia again.	3.282634219059271
With regard to endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, the pharmacodynamic effects of racemic and S-(+)-ketamine were comparable.	2.8427817378792097
Because of the significant improvement in recovery and the reduced quantitative drug load, S-(+)-ketamine offers a clinical advantage compared with currently used racemic ketamine.	3.0320881266185298
The closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying, if a free transplant is necessary.	3.18456969391433
Following the technique of Tillmann described first in 1908, several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined.	3.016826059309784
We report on 14 patients (ages 41-88 years) where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors (5 melanomas, 5 basal cell carcinomas, 1 keratoacanthoma, 1 trichilemmal cyst, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 skin metastasis) were successfully closed by this method.	3.0518975659183503
The diameter of the defect ranged between 4 and 8 cm (mean 5,7 cm).	3.862432548184167
Size and number of the rotating flaps (3 or 4) was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue.	4.144424901499688
The procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases.	4.043669616577732
Wound healing occurred without complications except in 3 cases.	3.570597150689647
2 patients (63 years, 70 years) developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps.	2.977801291889981
In a 74 year old man with a very large defect of 8 cm diameter, one flap of four underwent total necrosis.	3.1928136126631457
The cosmetic result was rated "very good" in 71,4% and "good" in 14,3%.	3.458369563022182
The "windmill procedure" is an important addition to the surgical approaches for closure of large defects on the scalp, particularly in young patients.	4.156699587906908
Despite systematic diagnostics, distinguishing between pulmonary emboli and tumors is difficult.	3.0784606747637624
We report a patient who was referred because of suspected embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery.	3.276498352555239
The operation was started with the intention of performing a pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy; however, intraoperative histology revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor.	3.056624812335932
Therefore, the left lung was resected with the use of extracorporeal circulation, and the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery were reconstructed.	4.789522313947158
A solitary right lung metastasis was resected 3 months later using stapling devices.	3.1395846665521523
Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with sarcoma of the pulmonary arteries.	4.445874139817123
Since, thromboembolic obstruction cannot be excluded preoperatively, patients with this type of disease should be treated at centers experienced with the broad spectrum of pulmonary artery surgery.	4.132539568140309
Only 28 cases are reported in the literature.	2.912277350547942
We treated a 20-year-old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies, one operation and one MRI; finally, phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins.	3.103203337248015
To avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed.	3.639836010236788
Hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages: (1) stigmatization of the patient; (2) the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion; (3) in many patients, the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect; (4) acoustic feedback when amplification is high.	4.27895512911017
Conventional hearing aids transmit sound into the ear canal via a small microphone.	3.365303775934662
Sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission.	3.3118436079140254
This along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned.	3.4544177600364394
In contrast, implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations.	2.812517031789271
The hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system bypassing the air.	2.8885919491247867
This implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane, the ossicular chain, the perilymph of the inner ear, or the skull.	3.8762151355381422
Corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines.	3.8152573530669236
For the majority of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) many available hearing aids often do not achieve satisfactory results.	2.994360685477217
For these patients partially implantable hearing devices have been developed, allowing distortion-free hearing and speech intelligibility that may be superior to conventional hearing aids.	3.2991831562694105
The external parts of partial implants, however, may result in a patient's stigmatization.	3.7956048332066876
Furthermore, they do not use the acoustic properties of the external auditory canal.	3.818110715354852
Recently, we published the successful development of the first totally implantable hearing device for the treatment of SNHL (HNO 46 [1998] 853-863).	3.710780848707389
Here we report the first implantations of this unique, totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients with SNHL: Implex TICA LZ 3001.	3.2317880991372516
The implant microphone is implanted subcutaneously in the outer ear canal near the ear drum.	3.0327632710111962
The signal is processed by a digitally programmable multichannel audioprocessor located subcutaneously on the bony skull behind the ear.	2.720186557893536
A piezoelectric transducer is coupled to the body of the incus and drives the ossicular chain by vibratory actions.	3.1451202920433783
Energy is provided by an implantable battery.	3.8635449177985186
Implanted patients describe hearing as being distortion-free and transparent.	3.513389123639423
Speech intelligibility and the hearing of music are improved.	3.2550700296233446
Patients may achieve better speech discrimination, especially in the presence of background noise.	4.1161568551289145
The aid can be used during sports, including swimming.	4.237241530223813
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the implantation of a totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients.	2.5164438082492038
These results encourage further implantations of the totally implantable hearing system in the course of an ongoing clinical study.	3.5993001313944744
Catheter ablation by means of radiofrequency energy (RF) is an established method in the treatment of various forms of supraventricular and atrioventricular tachycardias.	4.5487009853159925
In patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), the success of catheter ablation depends on the pathophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmia and on the underlying heart disease.	4.416404986828272
In the following report we give a definition of the terms nomenclature and classification.	3.1778716486763505
We find out, that the two terms are very similar.	4.247598629476128
They include the keys for diagnosis and therapy.	3.454030882924855
We propose a method to construct new coding-systems.	2.813846573226649
Furthermore we report about the existing coding-systems in Orthopaedics and Traumatology.	3.4315621576018205
We cite a list of national and international coding-systems.	3.1167972407717084
Because of the actuality we finally give a definition of the term "Indikationsspezifische Komplikation", which is of importance since the "5.	3.433657002048048
Änderungsverordnung" of the "BPFLV-95" within the classification of the "Fallpauschalen".	3.4646941176557835
"Fallpauschalen" are a system like the American DRG's (Diagnosis related groups), but not exacly the same.	3.706691278863012
Resection of a stenosing colon tumor in an 89-year-old male patient led to the diagnosis, unusual at this age, of an inflammatory pseudotumor (synonym: plasma cell granuloma) of the retroperitoneum and mesentery, which invaded the large bowel and showed infiltration of one regional lymph node.	3.3815440577228055
The etiology and exact nosological classification of inflammatory pseudotumors are not yet unequivocally settled.	3.1957353753668096
The recently published conjecture that such lesions of the retroperitoneum represent a separate entity with features of a malignant neoplasm is discussed.	3.4884981524572747
An example of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour (PFT) is presented for the first time in the German-language literature.	3.7064973648727535
The diagnostic criteria for this rare soft-tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood, which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur, include the plexiform structure which gives it its name, extensive siderin deposits and numerous osteoclast-like giant cells.	3.258431107650449
The development of the tumour described here, which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant haemangiopericytoma excised 7 years previously, indicates the possibility of induction of PFT by radiation.	4.264126024530763
The current increase in the cost of health care must be considered as a severe threat to the prehospital emergency services system.	3.9340428084386567
Two examples have been selected - the patient with polytrauma and the patient in cardiac arrest - to demonstrate the dilemma between a need for objective data and the requirements of emergency patients.	4.437014303619953
Study results obtained in trauma patients indicating that total prehospital time, including scene time, is correlated to patient outcome have led to the conclusion that at the scene treatment by emergency physicians may be dispensable.	3.7217201527818795
It has, however also been demonstrated that the time required for medical treatment at the scene is equivalent to 20% of the total scene time, thus representing only a fraction of the total prehospital time.	4.237076158601111
Correlating the total prehospital time or scene time to outcome therefore appears absurd.	3.283102022847944
The treatment principle of aggressive shock treatment in polytrauma needs critical reevaluation on the basis of results obtained by recent preclinical studies in patients with penetrating torso injuries.	3.719285113930605
Small volume resuscitation could not be demonstrated to improve outcome in polytrauma patients, although a slight improvement in patients with brain injury may be assumed.	4.154776826934286
Unfortunately, for ethical reasons randomised carefully controlled comparative studies can not be performed in polytrauma patients unless the patient is fully conscious.	3.7372807452757613
The importance of endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation in unconscious trauma patients becomes apparent under conditions of anaesthesia where the application of the endotracheal tube averts regurgitation, aspiration and concomitant morbidity and mortality.	3.192910409155515
The common causes of cardiovascular collapse and their pathomechanisms, as well as the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, have been widely investigated.	3.95612100675313
Nevertheless, various aspects of their application are still controversial.	3.2914943932876595
The most recent study results have recommended initial ventilation prior to thoracic compression.	2.793160386007874
New methods of assisting mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation, such as ACD CPR or vest CPR, have shown promising results in animal experiments.	3.1925892892399834
However, the importance of results obtained by preclinical randomised controlled investigations in humans need to be confirmed by further studies as to outcome.	3.6913240272328136
The efficacy of defibrillation in cases of ventricular fibrillation has been clearly demonstrated, particularly with a view to the interval between ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation.	3.954941694265683
It has further been demonstrated that basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves ventricular fibrillation and thus improves the chance of survival.	3.0507319366793744
The present generation of defibrillators has been further improved, particularly by the introduction of biphasic defibrillator wave forms, which may reduce the required energy, as well as possible complications, while offering an increase in the efficacy of defibrillation and a reduction in defibrillator size.	4.084447785327066
Scientific emergency medicine is responsible not only for the development and validation of new methods and concepts, but in particular for their application under quality control conditions.	3.845218571870021
Politicians require an improvement in the quality of the validation of emergency measures, although the instruments available for the investigation of these measures are known to be obsolete (experimental models, experimental design).	4.0266613341626165
Additionally, the financial support of research in emergency medicine suffers from being accourded low priority by public research funds such as the German Research Fund.	3.0961816445987256
However, in view of the rapid application of experimental results to daily practice it should be emphasized that patients also support research in emergency medicine via their direct financial contributions to the health insurance companies.	3.239289468190679
The prognosis in patients with gynecologic cancers depends not only on the stage but also on a wide spectrum of other findings.	3.8345347619324333
Cross-sectional imaging modalities, including sonography, CT and MRI, have increasingly been used for optimal treatment planning in gynecologic cancers.	3.4919391221818383
Their staging criteria are based on the well-established FIGO staging system.	4.5165217434306175
CT and MRI compete with sonography, which plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the female pelvis.	4.059526953710409
This paper reviews the role of sonography, CT and MRI in the staging of gynecologic malignancies.	3.570126013628409
It puts the emphasis on MRI, which has been established as imaging modality of choice in the preoperative evaluation of cervical and endometrial cancer, and which seems slightly superior to CT in the staging of ovarian cancer.	3.775399718196869
Extraabdominal desmoids represent one group of deep fibromatoses.	3.4271615942004043
These aggressive nonmetastasizing tumorlike lesions have a strong tendency to local infiltration, with a recurrence rate of about 40 %.	3.8161760500224964
Shoulder, chest wall, back and thigh are favored sites.	3.2067834022234805
By combination of different diagnostic procedures the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to only a few.	4.689062882941915
While in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy, nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation, hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important.	3.5184676027477475
Amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly.	3.715178685306143
We report on an eleven year-old boy, who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to Malawi.	3.098078276642913
Remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma-antigens.	3.142214763660718
Six weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting eggs of Schistosoma haematobium in the urine.	3.3775082479712384
Parasitological examinations of urine and faeces four months later were negative.	3.2411674722097064
There is still a significant lack of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for chronic pain patients in Germany today.	4.262346421189599
Most of all the treatment of low back pain and widespread pain syndromes or panalgesia is time consuming and complicated.	4.176019463497044
The main problem of anaesthesiological pain clinics is the increase of these complex pain syndromes in the last years.	3.6226473998839723
The definition of chronic pain is a contiuous noxious input modulated and compounded by the prolonged or recurrent nature of chronic state and further complicated by a multitude of economic and psychosocial factors.	3.1046752358410465
It is now clear that no one discipline or mode will suffice.	2.7362721357180644
Only a multidisciplinary and intensive approache will prevail, as discussed in this article.	3.133428913935047
Unfortunately these multidisciplinary pain units are nearly not existing in Gemany just as little as control of the effectiveness of pain treatment.	3.449356149580413
The use of somato-sensory evoked potentials (SEP) in supraaortal reconstructions has been well accepted.	2.9335069846367405
However, reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic SEP alterations differ widely.	3.09414812820799
In a prospective study we registered SEP alterations during 482 operations done on 419 patients between 1 July 1994, and 31 December 1996.	2.869783875312918
Incidence, risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated.	3.7512430896304685
In only 1.7% of cases SEP examination was inadequate.	3.035037074365986
During 406 operations SEP were altered minimally or not at all.	2.782201902679568
Significant changes were dedected during 65 interventions (13.5%).	3.0034120504158426
The clinical outcome was poor when alteration was found during carotid dissection (five events, three deficits).	2.891132486734475
Cross-clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations (81.5%); they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance.	3.037134752508377
As risk factor for cross-clamping ischaemia, only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified.	3.56993705373982
The pathogenesis of these structures is still unclear, but pathological secretion by neoplastic myoepithelial cells is supposed.	3.343634579761836
We present the case report of a 59-year-old woman with a myoepithelioma of the minor salivary glands in the smooth palate containing tyrosine-rich crystalloids as an example of this rare phenomenon.	2.849755821108639
Pseudoarthrosis and cubitus valgus as main complications following displaced fractures of the radial condyle in children can be prevented by open reduction and fixation by K wires.	3.3557752184198506
However, delayed union and stimulation of the radial physis with condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow as well as fishtail deformities of the distal end of the humerus are reported nevertheless.	4.019700202789971
To prevent those growth disturbances all primary and secondary (4-day X-ray control) displaced fractures of the radial condyle, i. e. those with a central gap of more than 2 mm, were prospectively treated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw beginning 1974.	3.5748610961862894
Sixty-six patients (41 boys, 25 girls) with an average follow-up of 10 years (2-22 years) sustained 28 primary and 6 secondary displaced fractures.	3.708484170524226
In 5 cases a K wire fixation was performed in view of the smallness of the fragment.	3.64069959611768
Two children with conservative treatment following overlooked displaced fractures showed condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow.	2.750102995162541
Screw osteosynthesis led to symmetric elbow angles and function in all cases, whereas fishtail deformities could be observed in 8 of 27 children, probably as a consequence of the remaining central fracture instability.	3.8879041180359417
Conclusion: Open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw prevents condylar overgrowth in displaced fractures of the radial condyle by guaranteeing fracture healing in anatomic position within 3-4 weeks.	3.0602041650529084
However, fishtail deformity can not be prevented by metaphyseal compression only.	3.404292530845695
A commercially available C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate was used for short-term prophylaxis before surgery in two patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema.	3.595431884156749
The patients suffered from recurrent subcutaneous and submucosal oedema of the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal tract as the result of a hereditary C1-INH deficiency.	3.3872384575659087
Both patients were receiving tranexamic acid or danazol therapy as oral long-term prophylaxis.	2.9426493653313517
Over the years the patients underwent several operations in regional and general anaesthesia, with mask ventilation or intubation.	3.5253896649477863
The C1-INH plasma concentrations measured preoperatively were always very low (0.02-0.06 g/l, normal range 0.15-0.35 g/l), despite the oral long-term prophylaxis.	3.4354568358018
Substitution treatment with 500-1000 U C1-INH was performed 1 h before surgery.	3.3714800858777583
No side effects were seen following the concentrate infusions.	3.056742335840539
With this substitution treatment no specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic oedema were recognized in either case.	2.9442634275101462
We suggest that infusion of C1 concentrate is an appropriate form of preoperative substitution treatment in patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema, in view of the lower risk of infection than with infusion of fresh-frozen plasma and the observed effectiveness.	3.78739111516205
This case report describes a 62 years old patient who suffered from therapy resisten atrial fibrillation for 12 years.	3.5055521756470083
She underwent "Cox/Maze-III-Procedure" during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved.	3.319391884922282
Two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm.	3.4903429825892314
Transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility.	2.9943760266679886
Therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics could be discontinued.	3.2554851188227882
Two cases of congenital wandering spleen with typical clinical course are reported:  An 11-year old girl had a two month history of intermittent abdominal pain predominantly after physical stress.	3.177230626064117
In upright position a palpable resistance could be identified as wandering spleen by ultrasound and scintiscan, and in this case splenopexy was performed.	3.553924725300297
An otherwise healthy 3-year old girl suffered from acute abdomen caused by torsion of an upside- down spleen with partial infarction.	3.5393401747920707
Diagnosis was made based on ultrasound and CT-Scan.	3.307810824270995
The extent of infarction could be evaluated by color flow sonography.	3.2669540797508545
After partial resection splenopexy in orthotopic position was performed.	3.0132997703371496
Discussion: In situations of intermittent abdominal pain as well as acute abdomen torsion of wandering spleen should be taken into consideration.	3.352157781456143
Monodisciplinary orthopaedic pain therapy no longer measures up to international standards.	3.146896235060976
In cases of chronic back pain, in particular, there is such a gulf between the clinical findings and the patient's subjective assessment that the symptoms cannot be attributed solely to so-called degenerative changes.	4.330476585554238
Back pain patients are in great danger of becoming fixated on somatic symptoms due to an excess of diagnostic procedures or incorrect diagnoses, of being treated purely somatically on the basis of associated findings, and of suffering irreversible damage from invasive management of such findings.	3.479154995023849
Despite the wealth of empirical evidence, it remains difficult to expand the everyday concept of illness and its causes to include not only physical and biological factors but also social and emotional disturbances.	3.1471352742596292
Particularly physicians with a purely biological concept of pain have not learned to take note of affective relational factors and incorporate them into their diagnostic assessment.	2.9000086315656097
The decision to undertake invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures then frequently represents the doctor's reaction to feelings of irritation or helplessness.	2.6907887280197644
The laboratory surveillance of measles in Germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation.	3.1770669495542814
Compared to data of the pre-vaccination era, the incidence of measles has been reduced, while a shift in age towards the group of 15-year-olds is observed.	4.352362259172991
Germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of eradicating measles in the European region by the year 2007.	3.5736748819145907
Apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking, the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot.	3.001062415769158
In order to effectively control measles, high vaccination rates of at least 90% are necessary by the end of the second year of life.	3.3356668591519756
In addition, laboratory surveillance has to be included to measure successful vaccination.	3.4416722528918657
Main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases, seroprevalence studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses.	3.7824062495443687
The Working Group Measles ("Arbeitsgemeinschaft Masern" - AGM) as well as the amended law on infection prevention are important instruments to make measurable progress towards measles eradication also in Germany.	2.916905729362602
We report on the activities of the National Reference Centre for Measles, Mumps and Rubella since 1991.	2.6411418377364004
The German data are compared to those of selected other European countries.	3.2369542166053433
The different methods that are available for the assessment and quantification of "brittle nails" and for the evaluation of various therapeutical approaches are compared.	4.447532620383227
At this time, measurement of the swelling properties is the best documented and most reliable method for studying the treatment of brittle nails.	3.8483416363928935
Reliable qualitative data can also be obtained by scanning electron microscopy.	3.868654677689944
Measurement of the transonychial water loss and assessment of thickness and density of nails by ultrasound have also been used successfully, but the methodology still has to be improved and the reproducibility, confirmed.	3.7970400350884286
The case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described.	3.6713999897854284
This combination of injuries is rather rare and only 25 cases were found in the literature.	3.597343787488206
The sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable, probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule.	3.4632141387750597
Immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result.	3.3884212976014427
The management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently.	3.2203070308520916
Surgeons' education, preclinical rescue structures, initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies, as well as diagnostic imaging, have progressed.	3.861105847698934
Plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of CT. Fast imaging techniques (spiral CT) have led to the inclusion of CT in the primary survey.	3.75748871047776
To minimize the risk to the patient during prolonged diagnostic time, algorithms have to be defined concerning structures, emergency room equipment and quality.	3.6284477227463525
Basics, state of the art and suggestions concerning management of multiple trauma patients are presented and discussed from the radiologist's point of view.	3.27415163326053
The importance of hepatitis C virus infection has been recently noted in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy.	3.5685525104060964
In a collaborative research project of the Committees for the Study of Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy, hepatitis C virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients (10.65) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in 42 of 663 patients (6.3%) with dilated cardiomyopathy; these prevalences were significantly higher than that found in volunteer blood donors in Japan.	3.1426831207852715
Hepatitis C virus antibody was detected in 650 of 11,967 patients (5.4%) seeking care in 5 academic hospitals.	3.120549938498355
Various cardiac abnormalities were found, and arrhythmias were the most frequent.	4.505525591438292
These observations suggest that hepatitis C virus infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases.	3.6895551591359945
Transdifferentiated retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) display enhanced contractile potentials and have been implicated in the development of tractional retinal detachment.	3.445685524804492
This study determines the activity of contraction-promoting factors, examines some involved mechanisms and evaluates inhibitors.	2.9299131749020964
Using an in vitro contractionassay, we demonstrated that collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells is effectively stimulated by serum, platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1.	3.124792999175863
Endothelin-1 and transforming growth factor-1 and -2 have a more discrete or marginal effect.	3.9216528508703306
Tractional forces promoted by these peptides are completely protein synthesis dependent.	3.1284921061484217
Contraction stimulated by serum is only partly dependent on de novo protein synthesis, suggesting different active factors and/or pathways.	3.499871517796732
Staurosporine, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, effectively inhibited collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells regardless of the promoter.	2.818870778349256
Revascularization in cases of recurrent occlusions following aorto-iliac vascular reconstructions, particular in high-risk patients, poses a therapeutic dilemma.	3.563978209947068
We report the case of a 78-year-old female patient who presented - after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries - with Leriche syndrome, resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease.	2.732878859810108
Due to the high surgical and anesthetic risk we implanted an axillo-bifemoral PTFE graft.	2.713185996467903
The preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high-grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid-subclavian bypass on the left.	4.2257001983790445
This stenosis was dilated and then stented by way of the proximal end of the axillo-bifemoral graft, which in turn was distally anastomosed to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery.	3.446517871967263
Postoperative angiography verified a good run-off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained.	3.0567345983159013
Duplex sonography 6 months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms.	4.479028753737123
These results demonstrate that, combined with intraoperative stent application, an axillo-bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results.	3.3514268781473713
Objective: Concerning the long-term somatic development of children born with very low birth weight and/or born very premature, there are varying and sometimes contradictory statements.	3.6813633494192826
A follow-up study was carried out on premature-born children from Thuringia and Saxonia at pre-school and early school age in order to investigate the long-term somatic development of these children.	3.5831877332410205
Anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group.	4.81587093649183
The combination of these two entities led to septic multiorgan failure in a 38-year-old woman.	3.0895690357609276
The patient was treated successfully by esophagectomy and postoperative lavage through a partially open abdomen.	2.7831246909797334
The lack of information regarding emesis, the leading symptom of Boerhaave's syndrome, caused delayed diagnosis: the triad of emesis, severe epigastric pain and emphysema of the skin was not established until 30 h after the onset of symptoms.	3.1864950977649653
For ethical and socio-economical reasons (cost-explosion in transfusion-medicine, patient's individual destiny), devepolment and consistent application of allogeneic transfusion sparing techniques in surgery is a chal- lenge to anesthesiologists, surgeons and blood-bankers.	2.8620840585129455
The combination of different techniques, i.e.	3.0030668661956375
autologous predonation, hemodilution, choice of anesthetic regimen, deliberate hypotension, application of anti-fibrinolytic agents and autotransfusion of intraoperatively saved blood allow for avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion even in patients presenting important intraoperative hemorrhage.	3.0525952181146665
Introduction: If the surgeon cannot find the tendon of the superior oblique muscle in the right place, he has to change his operative plans intraoperatively.	3.1834362034478865
Different procedures are recommended: reinsertion of the superior oblique in the right place, recession of the inferior oblique muscle, and operations on the vertical muscles of the same or the yoke eye.	3.4902214979385837
No quantitative recommendations on the surgical amount are mentioned in the literature.	2.9322010646756507
In 180 children (87 children belonging to a control group, 68 with fever of non-renal origin, and 25 with pyelonephritis) albumin and immunoglobulin G (markers for glomerular dysfunction), -1-microglobulin and  -NAG (markers for proximal tubular dysfunction) and apolipoprotein A1 (marker of 'postrenal' dysfunction) were measured in second-voided morning urine.	3.134509270593655
In children with fever of non-renal origin, glomerular dysfunction was encountered in 8.8 %, tubular dysfunction in 17.6 % and mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction in 14.7 % of cases.	2.6905983552822708
Among children with pyelonephritis, 28 % revealed glomerular dysfunction and 44 % mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction.	2.915384448268797
No case of solitary proximal tubular dysfunction was observed in children with pyelonephritis.	4.786740598519657
This may indicate that morphologic changes occur during interstitial pyelonephritis due to inflammation of glomeruli, resulting in glomerular dysfunction, while proximal tubular dysfunction may additionally be due to fever-associated function processes.	3.1363228431455656
Up to the middle of the 1970s, chemotherapy had only a marginal role in the overall treatment concept for cervical carcinoma, and surgery and radiotherapy are still the cornerstones of treatment today.	3.6578138111066467
There are indications for chemotherapy, which can theoretically be used as follows:	4.581692135051784
We compared a cw carbon dioxide flash-scanning laser system to an Er:YAG laser in laser skin resurfacing of facial rhytides.	2.774604679239071
In all patients, CO2 laser treatment showed a better cosmetic result whereas erythema and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation were less marked in Er:YAG laser therapy.	2.6769713813635034
A separation of the individual latex layers is a known complication of endotracheal armoured tubes manufactured by immersion technique.	3.4174966542601566
This can result in herniation into the lumen with obstruction of the tube.	3.458377232881275
Diffusion of nitrous oxide into the inner hernia considerably intensifies the obstruction.	2.9164126059349234
This can lead to life-threatening situations.	3.8067493324854955
We observed a similar herniation caused by layer separation with subsequent tube obstruction of silicolatex anaesthesia tubes used in paediatric circuit systems.	2.6836606128662783
This is caused by manufacturing defects and above all by damage incurred in reprocessing.	3.0057147722436537
A too-high drying temperature can cause premature layer separation.	2.9139840340144545
The tubes should never be processed more than 80 times.	3.4170232023641414
Routine examination of the tubes is imperative, especially at the predilection sites for layer separation.	3.4246540810625947
Severe aortic valve disease is a rare complication of coarctation in adults.	5.096557134473327
Between 1961 and 1990 aortic valve replacement was performed after or combined with the operation of coarctation in 24 adults (4% of entire population operated for coarctation).	3.4988125477964798
Bicuspid aortic valves were present in 2/3 of patients.	3.9521760182665293
Additional surgical interventions on the dilated aorta ascendens were performed in 8, mitral valve replacement in 2 and aorto-coronary bypass in 1 patients.	3.265232517165367
Early mortality was 224 (8%) and was similar in simultaneously (18) and staged (114) operated cases: 10 year survival was lower than in an age-matched group of 72 patients with aortic valve disease of similar severity operated during the same period (70% vs 88%, p < 0.01): 67 late deaths were cardia; 55 pts with preoperatively severely increased end-diastolic (> 199 mlm2) and 44 with end-systolic (> 90 mlm2) left ventricular volumes and 22 with ejection fraction < 41 % died late postoperatively.	3.283284182512008
Abstract  13 experienced addiction therapists provid-ed information about trauma experiences and comorbidity of 122 clients (26 women and 96 men) with opiate addiction and multiple substance abuse.	2.824520869353171
42% had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men.	3.628924003021509
The victimization primarely took place during childhood and prior to the begin of drug consumption.	3.268590386899826
26% of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder.	4.007161954494582
In comparison with individuals without trauma experiences, victims evidenced significantly more comorbid symptoms, they more frequently suffered from polytoxicomania and had more experiences with psychotherapy.	2.803734567689954
Nearly all drugs currently used during the course of general anaesthesia may lead to hypersensitivity reactions of various types.	4.239231651532709
Routine preoperative testing appears of little predictive value, in spite of the high frequency of so-called risk factors (atopy, other kind of allergy) among the evaluated group of patients.	3.4233417747197623
Careful allergological testing should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after any incidents of suspected drug intolerance, in order to discover the underlying causative agent.	3.832977791490847
RAST- and RIA-tests and/or mediator releasing tests may also used additionally.	3.73456907535949
For other classes of drugs (for example, volatile anesthetics and opioids) the clinical relevance of skin testing still remains uncertain.	3.38190555050214
For less severe incidents seen during general anaesthesia such as pruritus, or exanthems, skin testing seems to be less relevant.	3.3131170681988817
Nociception is a protective system of the body which prevents it from injury and tissue damage.	3.874228904903179
Human beings respond to noxious stimuli by moving away.	3.1382109933995923
They learn by pain to avoid these situations in future.	3.3669337662477066
Shortly after major injury, there is a limited analgesic period allowing the body to flee the area of danger, later on, emerging pain compels the body to rest and supports recuperation.	3.4265953689337705
While acute pain has a certain meaning, chronic pain does not.	3.4257563530410144
It induces a comprehensive suffering including loss of initiative, appetite and vigilance.	2.8552732227942257
It reduces life-quality, often accompanied by depressive moods.	3.3973870415227485
Acute pain causes changes in the central nervous system leading to an increased sensitivity of nociception (hyperalgesia).	3.991723888706566
During healing, the central processing of noxious stimuli is normalised taking minutes to weeks.	3.163666315283359
Sometimes, unknown factors initiate chronification of pain.	2.874607206033959
Changes on a molecular level in peripheral tissue as well as in the central nervous system induce "cellular early genes" [24], a synthesis of c-fos, c-jun and other proteins favouring the chronification of pain.	3.1554458084592034
All efforts have to be made to depress or interrupt such a development.	3.5648976051333428
One of the first steps to pain prophylaxis in a hospital is an optimal surgical technique: incision, extension, limited tissue damage and minimal invasive surgery should guarantee the smallest impairment of the nociceptive system possible.	3.3109485931067457
However, nociceptive input is intense and of long duration and leads to central sensibilisation.	3.1721128658874567
Postoperative pain has lost its function as surgery anticipates healing.	3.122160432525741
Pain induces a reduction of ventilation, circulation, digestion and increases the risk of other disorders.	4.025841271456477
There is need of aggressive pain treatment for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of late sequelae like permanent pain and increased reduction of function [10].	3.0987907649590016
This is of pivotal importance in patients with amputations or sympathetic reflex dystrophy (SRD).	3.507627726757122
Antinociception is best provided by regional anaesthesia technique with a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids which results in better outcome [2, 12].	3.7913939557271545
Hence, regional anaesthesia techniques are strongly indicated in those patients.	3.4848445144591067
Anand [1] demonstrated a lower morbidity and mortality in 45 newborns undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, when general anaesthesia was performed with high-dose sufentanil versus halothane supplementary doses of morphine.	3.803238871765464
Anaesthesiologists have to reconsider the quality of general anaesthesia: the antinociception of their regimen.	3.983475630172529
In diagnostics of erectile dysfunction there are different simple or large-scale procedures available.	3.2217671781914006
Refering to a three-step-scheme that makes difference in the diagnostics in I. non-invasive, II.	3.800800165103568
invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained.	4.0305192114532735
To the non-invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics, the physical examination and laboratory screenings.	3.471872917189844
The semi-invasive procedures include the intracavernous injection test with vasoactice substances, the doppler sonography and duplex or color duplex sonography, the corpus-cavernosum-electromyogram (CC-EMG) and other neurophysiological examinations.	2.8435211424525444
The third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological cavernosography and cavernosometry (DICC) and the selective pharmacological phallo-arteriography.	3.0064828509721284
The procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions.	3.429110655443901
Technological advances in the last two years in mammalian nuclear transfer techniques and the establishment of human embryonic stem cell lines formed the background of the International Workshop on "Embryonic Stem Cells and Nuclear Transfer Strategies" organized at the Gene Center, Munich, September 1999.	3.2187083315151224
The aim of the meeting was to bring together scientists working in the stem cell field and those working on somatic nuclear transfer techniques to discuss the present status and prospects of both technologies for basic and applied research and future use in medicine and livestock breeding.	2.9443480429498408
"Biology of Embryonic Stem Cells", "Nuclear Transfer Strategies", and "Stem Cell Differentiation - Cell Therapy" were the main topics of the meeting.	2.967508995825095
It became clear that we are far from understanding the processes involved in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and the mechanisms resulting in reprogramming of nuclei from somatic cells after transfer into enucleated oocytes.	2.851756138485931
However, data were presented that showed the enormous potential of the embryonic stem cell technology for tissue transplantation in the future.	3.2642913163561538
Before any use of this technology in combination with any cloning technology for human cell therapy will be possible, further research including animal models and stem cell differentiation approaches in culture (i. e., identification of differentiation factors, selective differentiation strategies, reporter gene assays) is necessary to understand the basic principles of pluripotent stem cell differentiation and the mechanisms involved in reprogramming somatic cell nuclei.	3.293366523397153
Certain fractures and/or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post-traumatic osteonecrosis.	4.315357942073512
Intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation, and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent hypofibrinolysis.	3.134356610926722
The aim of our study was to investigate the influence that serum of patients with preeclampsia has on t-PA and PAI-1 expression from human endothelial cells.	2.6722519343066886
For this purpose, we cultured human endothelium cells, gained from umbilical veins, for 24 h with sera of 7 patients with HELLP syndrome and 12 patients with preeclampsia.	3.2886632400160005
The sera of 12 normotensive pregnant patients and 9 non-pregnant women were used as controls.	3.107579414811557
We then determined t-PA and PAI-1 levels by ELISA, both in the maternal serum and in the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures.	3.152650608020811
While t-PA levels were significantly higher in the serum of patients with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome than in the control group (median: 8.0 ng/ml and 6.2 ng/ml vs 3.9 ng/ml and 3.1 ng/ml), levels of PAI-1 did not show any significant disparity among the different groups.	3.562925700135386
The increased expression of t-PA and PAI-1 from human endothelium cells after stimulation with the serum of preeclamptic patients must be considered as a sign of increased endothelial cell activation.	3.1969276769844255
Postoperative pain relief can be achieved by several methods, including the use of systemic opioids and regional anaesthesia with intrathecal or epidural opioids or local anaesthetics.	3.97556637549505
On-demand analgesia using a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) system is regarded as the ideal option for systemic opioid analgesia.	3.467300058426388
While PCA devices are not yet commonly used in all recovery units, the use of repetitive boluses on demand is still the most frequent form of administration in postoperative pain therapy.	3.908811810439751
The objective of the present study was to show if continuous infusion of the opioid tramadol could produce better analgesia than repetitive administration of boluses.	3.202699509992642
In a study under double-blind conditions 135 ASA I and II patients were assigned at random to group I (infusion group) or group B (bolus group) when they first requested pain treatment after abdominal surgery.	3.247019403547263
The patients in group I received an initial intravenous loading dose of 100 mg tramadol, followed by an infusion of 12 mg/h tramadol for 24 h; if necessary, repeated boluses of 50 mg tramadol were given.	3.6770750654980224
In group B the patients received a placebo infusion instead of the tramadol infusion; otherwise, the procedure was the same.	3.823939729007524
Pain relief was monitored by means of a VAS (visual analogue scale) up to 6 h after surgery.	3.6553614730854895
We investigated the retrograde assessment of analgesia by the patients after 6 h, how often repetitive boluses were required, and the amount of analgesics administered in 6 and 24 h. Results.	4.053963355159962
The pain relief was assessed as excellent or good by 76.5% of group I and 65.6% of group B; 19.1% of group I and 26.9% of group B assessed the analgesic effect as satisfactory; 4.4% of group I and 7.5% of group B complained of insufficient analgesia.	3.2944371473826193
In group I 69.2% requested only one or no repetitive bolus, compared with 40.3% in group B, while two or more boluses were demanded by 30.8% in group I and 59.7% in group B.	3.246869053135365
The average analgesic consumption after 6 h was 223.5 +/- 53.7 mg tramadol in group I and 176.6 +/- 63.1 mg tramadol in group B, respectively.	3.0125848092160257
After 24 h it was 449.5 +/- 66.0 mg tramadol in group I and 201.6 +/- 83.9 mg tramadol in group B.	2.842957972545233
While the consumption during the first 6 h was comparable, from then on the consumption in group I increased significantly.	4.041858328560297
Side effects were reported by 25% in both groups.	3.0629271746160485
They were clinically irrelevant and did not necessitate termination of the clinical trial in any case.	3.648383619293308
During the study period pulse and blood pressure remained within the normal range and did not show any significant changes.	3.14659812941879
The fact that the patients in group I requested far fewer repetitive boluses than those in group B and the assessment by the patients led to the conclusion that treatment in the infusion group is better than that in the bolus group.	4.5516233892063624
Concerns that a significantly higher consumption of analgesics would cause unwanted side-effects have proven unfounded.	3.7546876081619667
Six hours after surgery, when analgesia was evaluated by the patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups.	4.095339089522115
Not until the maintenance infusion had been administered for a further 18 h, was the tramadol consumption within the infusion group significantly higher.	3.5583225633823807
Thus, we should consider continuing unreduced administration of the maintenance infusion 6 h after operation.	3.399834413119024
The concept of tuberculid was introduced by Darier in 1896.	2.772730570400834
In contrast to "true" cutaneous tuberculosis, properties of the tuberculids were explained by an hyperergic response to myobacteria or their fragments released from a different site of manifest or passed tuberculous infection.	2.861956526361221
Key features include a strongly positive tuberculin skin test, evidence of concomitant manifest or past tuberculosis, and prompt response to antituberculous therapy The inability to culture M. tuberculosis or to demonstrate it microscopically from lesional biopsies, together with reports on tuberculid-like eruptions after BCG vaccination, supports this concept.	2.8038897691742366
Clinical manifestations are lichen scrophulosorum, papulo-necrotic tuberculids and erythema induratum of Bazin.	2.7901889488609424
The existence of tuberculids has been questioned, however, because the clinical and histological appearances are not always specific.	4.913298852506102
An increasing number of case reports on tuberculids, new immunological tests and molecular biology-based techniques for the detection of mycobacteria have shed new light on the tuberculid concept.	3.128493043588912
Case Report: A 20-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of a pneumothorax.	4.374218493394471
A secondary amenorrhea was coexisting.	3.255142431289782
On the abdominal wall and in the anogenital area a maculopapular exanthema was visible.	3.7418883226281916
Chest X-ray and HR-CT showed a interstitial lung disease with high probability of histiocytosis X which was confirmed by biopsies of lung and skin tissue.	3.561554469078124
The cause of amenorrhea was a histiocytic infiltration of the pituitary stalk.	2.9862197267335397
Conventional "consensus-treatment" for adults with vinblastine, prednisone and etoposide did not prevent relapsing bilateral pneumothoraces.	2.8276545089161886
Treatment was successful with the protocol as proposed by the international study for children.	3.2769575193075586
This treatment is characterized by higher dosage and combination with 6-mercaptopurine.	3.968989163124794
The prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor.	3.8578188973296443
The hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70-90% in patients with solid tumors to 75-90% in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95% in patients after bone marrow transplantation.	3.7487614911155904
The number of patients referred to intensive care units is however increasing, due to improvements in the general treatment of malignant diseases.	3.8792154099910108
This results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients.	3.0850750985347597
Since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified.	3.371108915501144
A reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures.	3.938636214285708
Patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with vasopressors is necessary and/or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present.	3.466799466866191
For these patients a withdrawal of further life support may be considered.	3.3197739899195757
Intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases.	3.8252418879956056
For other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making.	4.600191319867092
On the basis of a solution-oriented marital therapy, the different within-session effects of four different types of questions in systemic therapy (lineal, strategic, circular, and reflexive), as described by Tomm (1989), were tested.	3.1704560716989216
In this single case study, the method of plan analysis (Caspar 1989) was used to categorize the client's reactions to the four types of therapeutic questions.	3.8590399872163497
Lineal and strategic questions were expected to have a stabilizing and restraining effect on the system (i.e.	3.5165994914644627
the client, the clients' interaction, and the therapeutic interaction), whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change.	3.992692486092706
Interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife, who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change.	3.6771222453224413
Some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects.	3.31513641913284
Therefore, it is suggested that an interaction effect between questions and the motivation for change can be assumed.	3.570504723152797
Prerequisites for experimental study designs are extremely difficult to realise under prehospital emergency conditions.	3.1393612953474985
Results obtained in animal experiments always need validation with prehospital or inhospital patient studies.	3.016204101218373
Investigations related to emergency medicine are, however, an ethical obligation on behalf of the patient.	3.7184685834767452
A retrospective analysis of the available literature should be considered a prerequisite for prospective randomised and controlled studies.	4.726484250164118
Frequently, a pilot study or feasibility trial needs to precede the actual study.	3.269241622498079
Informed consent must be obtained for all patient studies.	3.3275026298144414
However, under emergency conditions informed consent cannot always be obtained due to unconsciousness, etc.	2.8621410220931134
Nevertheless, the following principles should be observed: (a) randomised studies are essential, even in emergency medicine; (b) they are ethically acceptable if the treatment provided for the study group is at least equivalent to the therapy for the control group; ( c) only these preconditions guarantee that the patient always receives treatment in accordance with the standard of treatment.	3.988322910421241
If the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give informed consent, the principle of deferred consent is acceptable.	3.1260969161523606
The deferred consent principle should be carefully documented.	3.296840087200681
A prospective randomized study represents the gold standard for an investigation, even under emergency conditions.	3.2788270268787083
There are different principles of randomization: telephone or telefax randomisation, etc.	2.784123356707638
Emergency medicine investigations need to be completed within a reasonable time frame which should, as a rule, not exceed 2 years.	3.7249931602384074
Otherwise, too many items might change without being noted.	3.0884223240586457
Curative treatment and the intention to treat are terms employed by ethics committees.	3.4559658242725053
If an investigation does not bear in itself additional risk factors, it does not necessarily have to be brought before the ethics committee.	3.8161412388225786
If, however, for example, the effect of obtaining blood samples is investigated separately for research purposes, the patient needs to be informed and sign the respective agreement.	4.514096480233182
In Germany the ethics committees have agreed to accept their respective decisions.	2.946563054329994
For multicentre and multinational studies, however, the ethics committees also need to accept decisions made by non-German ethics committees.	3.441381099971058
Not all therapeutic principles can serve as the basis of prospective randomized studies because they need to be considered the present standard of care (e.g., endotracheal intubation, etc.).	4.1538101473521225
In principle, the overall emergency physician protocol does not fulfill scientific requirements.	3.014750950537293
For all studies, particularly in the prehospital setting, an independent observer should be involved for documentation purposes.	3.278652717425381
Biases in emergency medicine studies focus on the variability of EMS, personnel qualifications, etc.	3.6183465388999596
This is in part why it is extremely difficult to prove efficacy and efficiency in emergency medicine.	3.164465250441203
New antifungals for oral therapy have improved the chances of healing onychomycoses.	3.2596838700190096
Nevertheless, in daily practice the failure rate is 20-30% both with itraconazole and terbinafine.	3.2856447837546523
In our investigations for the fungicidal effects of terbinafine, we could show that the same strain of Trichophyton rubrum or T. mentagrophytes in the rest period needs 1000 times higher concentration of terbinafine (2,0 to 0,002 µg/ml) for complete fungal killing as in the growth phase.	3.295928517843173
Thus resting fungi in the nail are not harmed, and if the concentration of terbinafine is lower than the MIC for the fungi, they can cause a relapse.	3.598755146808914
Itraconazole is a fungistatic agent.	3.4875156423376015
Its concentration in the nail plate must be higher than the MIC for the causative fungi for a long time - 10 to 12 months.	3.7245022872080935
The usual short-term treatment of onychomycosis over 3 months can be insufficient in individual cases such as patients with disorders, e.g.	3.113129318614945
circulatory disorders or slowed nail growth.	3.5179585518644525
This paper presents an algorithm for automatic switching between atrial tracking and nontracking pacing mode based on a "4 out of 7" concept: if 4 out of 7 atrial intervals are sensed below a critical value, mode switching (MS) is automatically performed.	2.885142615604684
The technical solution in Medtronic Kappa 700 dual chamber devices is explained together with an evaluation of advantages and possible limitations.	3.066362981542866
The "4 out of 7" algorithm offers a quick MS; by the addition of a "blanked flutter search" algorithm integrated into this concept, the detection of atrial flutter is facilitated in a wider range of programmed AV intervals.	3.202186770989172
With the increased rapidity of MS and sensitivity towards atrial flutter detection, there is also an increased propensity to switch to the nontracking mode in case of short atrial runs and frequent premature atrial beats.	3.355762728440385
Therefore, to optimize the MS function, programming of the device (e.g., activation of a time delay before MS) should be carried out individually with respect to the intrinsic rhythm and arrhythmia of the patient.	3.5796009204454267
Possible interactions between different programmable parameters should also be taken into consideration.	2.916002665128056
Some guidelines are presented in this paper.	3.2623007618191835
Finally, the use of extended stored diagnostic data seems to be crucial to evaluate pacemaker performance, incidence of atrial arrhythmias, and (as far as possible) confirmation of the stored data themselves by assessment of stored intracardiac electrograms.	3.481035375175
Between 1983 and 1991 ten patients with chronic frontal sinus disease underwent frontal osteoplastic flaps with fat obliteration.	3.2799158983102106
In order to judge operative success on a long-term basis all patients were called for postoperative follow-up.	3.39835515926846
They then completed a questionaire, in which they were asked about postoperative complaints.	3.937118714887152
Additionally, sinuses were examined by computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR).	3.049178834980177
CT scans showed complete obliteration of the frontal sinuses in all patients.	3.84271860331225
In these patients, two-thirds of the fat had been replaced by connective tissue.	3.185253768053807
MR was used in an attempt to show evidence for suppurative disease in the frontal sinus, but the MR images failed to correlate with symptoms.	4.52564333789118
Additional results could not be obtained when compared to CT.	4.671314150544828
Overall operating success could only be determined by clinical assessment and confirmed the value of the frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration.	3.8881790446363445
The objective of our trial was to evaluate the significance and usefulness of sentinel lymphadenectomy (SLNE) for the staging of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients.	3.490565552836305
The study presented illustrates the method and our results.	3.368421437293864
As has been documentated for melanoma, the first lymph node [sentinel node (SLN)] to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor is the expected first site of lymph-node metastasis.	3.405714455817745
The database presented includes 12 patients with operable breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes.	3.2746345089857596
In 11 cases the described method was applicable.	3.134927861446661
In only one case was there no correlation between the histology of the SLN and the axillary specimen.	3.391554678393186
Successful completion of examination of a large number of patients with a long follow-up has the potential of reducing the number of axillary dissections and of significantly reducing morbidity in the majority of breast cancer patients.	5.121879493129128
Background: Information on the extent and degree of the thermal effect produced is of great importance for control of the laser dosage in laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK) and for postoperative follow-up.	3.5059223145337666
We investigated on acute LTK effects which information images obtained by optical low coherence tomography (OCT) offer compared to those obtained by polarization microscopy.	2.9032067995406354
In cases with protected left main stenosis by previous bypass surgery or as an emergency intervention in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is performed as an alternative treatment strategy to bypass surgery.	3.5171456756434987
A review of 262 left main angioplasties revealed a procedure-related mortality in cases without protection of the left main coronary artery of 9.1% (4/44), in cases with partially protected left main stenosis by collaterals to either left coronary artery of 4.8% (1/21) and 0.5% (1/187) in cases with nonobstructed bypass grafts to either left coronary artery.	3.464048283465473
The risk stratification of the procedure can be evaluated by the proposed grading of left main artery protection.	4.2134228941767295
Hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure.	3.1060185914265315
There are a few reports of hypocalcemic children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism.	3.418114722128101
In all these patients, however, cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years.	4.829192837860389
In addition, other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism, e.g., convulsive seizures, had been present prior to cardiac symptoms.	2.9895441412355375
In this publication, Nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms, etiology and pathogenesis.	3.951562680388743
Clarification of the etiology is still pending.	4.168828059556797
Molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings.	3.6194565654644864
A case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist.	3.9890264860760687
Possibilities and problems in relation to therapy are demonstrated.	3.9817050300812293
The results of ankle arthroplasty have generally been disappointing compared to other forms of arthroplasty.	3.083666270442658
The present survey of results of ankle arthroplasty deals with the anatomical, the kinemasiological the biomechanical and the biological features of the ankle joint.	3.254320889430312
These features all seem important prerequisites for a successful total ankle prosthesis design.	3.289029160239955
From the study of the results displayed in the literature and those of my own series it can be stated that a modern ankle arthroplasty should respect the normal anatomy and kinemasiology.	3.712548257392575
Biomechanically it should work as a normal ankle joint i. e. cylindrical mobility, congruency and a possibility for normal torque within the ankle mortise.	3.2065970444502665
The prosthesis components should only be fixed in solid subchondral bone, and preferably without cement.	3.4463653335784854
Only compressible forces should act at the bone-prosthesis interface.	3.268437469375299
The axis of the ankle joint as well as of that of the hindfoot should be aligned to normal.	4.837440854976556
Meticulous surgery and special guide instruments are absolute necessities.	3.3923475555369804
Restoration of muscle power and gait postoperatively are essential for a good and lasting result.	3.431877060925458
The indication for ankle arthroplasty is mainly cases of osteoarthritis (primary or traumatic) and rheumatoid arthritis.	2.947207597750843
Contraindications are talus necrosis, Charcot joints, extreme osteoporosis, severe arteriosclerosis, and very aggressive arthritis.	2.9182703389320976
Mental disorders and neurological disorders may also be contraindications.	3.943781179572283
Furthermore, the patients should agree not to perform sports involving jumping and running or other ankle demanding activities.	3.115813845867729
The average annual failure rate should not exceed 1 % if these recommendations are followed.	3.181101345112654
Elbow flexion plays a key role in the overall function of the upper extremity.	4.3584490753170515
In the case of unilateral complete brachial plexus lesion, restoration of elbow flexion will dramatically increase the patient's chances of regaining bimanual prehension.	2.8459803550785168
Furthermore, depending on the type of reconstruction, stability of the glenohumeral joint as well as some supination function of the forearm can be restored to a varying degree at the same time.	3.8014893097406484
Depending on the level of brachial plexus lesion and/or reinnervation, different reconstructive procedures are available.	3.7744489777656822
Our concept is based on our experience with more than 1100 patients presenting a brachial plexus lesion between 1981 and 1996 and treated in our institution.	4.112932370059258
There were 528 operative revisions of the brachial plexus.	3.206916263632584
Some 225 patients underwent secondary muscle/tendon transfers.	3.1948311316646247
In 35 patients elbow flexion was reconstructed by bipolar latissimus dorsi transfer (n = 10), triceps-to-biceps transfer (n = 15), modified flexor/pronator muscle mass proximalization (n = 6) and multiple-stage free functional muscle transfer after intercostal nerve transfer (n = 4).	3.257159294916449
The official German guidelines for prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called the Robert-Koch-Institut, 12 years ago.	2.184099785338972
The recently published official "Guidelines for Prevention of Intravascular-Device Associated Infections" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	1.87819967319726
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the offical German guidelines.	2.078281191623347
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German-speaking anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide an update on the prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections.	2.520388040721241
We assessed the interindividual diagnostic variance of 39 experienced arthroscopists by the Kappa Cohen interobserver variation analysis using videotapes of eight different patients with different diagnoses.	2.9073590756477703
Arthroscopically normal findings showed a relatively acceptable interobserver correlation.	3.4544258348102934
In patellar alignment there was also great interobserver variation.	3.315140591831184
Clinical relevance: When comparing arthroscopic findings with other imaging techniques the above results should be taken into account.	3.0619207138638314
Furthermore, these results will affect the significance of medical expertise based only on pictures.	3.375177144372405
In addition, medical cost billing, which is based on arthroscopic findings, has to take into account that a wrong diagnosis is possible and therefore charges will be wrong.	3.820234383202053
Squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4% of all invasive carcinomas of the breast.	4.057398509426677
Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare, since they occur in less than 1% of all primary invasive breast carcinomas.	3.847294071451192
In order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin, especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell carcnoma from a different location.	3.729733216890507
Causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear.	4.013527074362941
Squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma.	3.725181144329066
Here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role.	3.192500238909295
The number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years.	3.079864038127589
These tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory pseudocapsule.	3.1774713486935844
The limited success of thrombolytic therapy and the high percentage of patients who have to be excluded from lysis has resulted in the alternative application of primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction.	3.894086144354237
Randomized studies so far available have shown a significant decrease of hospital mortality by primary PTCA as compared to thrombolysis.	4.0943578425260165
Adjuvant stent implantation and a wider administration of glycoprotein IIA/IIIB inhibitors may further reduce mortality.	3.0663895533892007
For logistic and financial reasons however, not all patients with acute myocardial infarction can benefit from this therapeutic approach in spite of the high density of health care in Germany.	3.8767671847136693
Primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction should be left to experienced centres and investigators.	3.144496343032611
Of utmost importance is a reduction of the present "onset-to-opening" times by information campaigns, an improved triage, use of transportation times for pre-hospital lysis and improved thrombolytic agents.	3.7075865944768114
Some 245,000 sporting accidents occur yearly in Switzerland.	3.0891317049340072
The social accident costs amount to approximately 1.8 billion francs per year.	2.779447301264997
Every second sporting accident occurs during a ball game.	3.1201365146617204
For the shown sporting activities, distortion is the most common type of injury among adults and contained fractures are most common in children.	3.646110902211008
As is to be expected, the number of accidents has grown along with the exploding popularity of snowboarding and in-line skating.	4.083729773574302
These new sporting activities show no unknown injury patterns which would demand new treatment methods.	3.0398485776364215
Abstract:  The combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex.	3.119762673515701
However, this method is technically pretentious and time consuming.	3.4641558561081953
Therefore, functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery.	3.5292584219677194
We report on a 15-year-old girl and her relatives with typical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII.	2.7384468218273437
Main symptoms of this disorder are fragile skin, easy bruisability, joint hypermobility, features suggesting premature aging, and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth.	2.8745857901074143
The inheritance of this type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant.	2.982578592242998
The acute liver failure (ALF) is a complex syndrome resulting from loss of synthetic and metabolic functions of the liver.	3.612499329854627
Despite recent advances in intensive care medicine patients with severe ALF have a very high mortality and the orthotopic liver transplantation still remains the only proven effective treatment of ALF.	3.9440987349296908
Numerous attempts have been made to improve survival by using various extracorporeal support techniques, but none of these therapeutic approaches was able to increase the survival rate.	3.825766118827598
Liver support systems based on detoxification procedures only could not influence the deleterious course of the disease.	2.7878908795306314
It is certain that an ideal liver support system should be capable to fulfil the liver's essential synthetic and metabolic functions as well as detoxification and excretion.	3.162229603554578
Over the last years the development of hybrid liver assist devices has aimed at replacing these liver functions and therefore might give an advantage over earlier systems based on detoxification techniques only.	3.048613916317122
This article gives a short review of the various liver support systems and focuses then on the hybrid liver support systems, their construction and the remaining problems after the first clinical applications.	3.595243915307483
After a latency period of 20 years, in a 39-year-old Austrian citizen of Chinese origin, a surgically removed rectal carcinoma, as well as the neighboring chronic inflammatory rectal mucosa with various degrees of dysplasia and one positive neighboring lymph node, showed helminthiasis in the histopathological examination, convincing us of a link between carcinoma and chronic helminthiasis.	3.157939618086565
Whereas the etiological context between chronic infection by Schistosoma haematobium and endemic frequent urinary bladder carcinoma is considered a matter of fact, whether of not the incidence of intestinal carcinoma is increased in connection with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis is controversial.	3.3507937074271847
The etiological and pathogenetic link between helminthiasis and carcinoma should be considered in the same way as for other related inflammatory large-bowel diseases.	3.216446505220609
In the sequence chronic inflammation - severe dysplasia, the formation of carcinoma could possibly occur.	3.1715942717077916
Besides a survey of trematodes parasitology and pathology, the link between rectal carcinoma and Schistosomiasis japonicum is pointed out by means of appropriate literature investigations.	3.4405538865501826
Rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication.	3.5636568707447154
Mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature.	3.1381378354670884
This paper reports on a 51-year-old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using V-Y technique.	3.5441475953260997
On day 8 after operation, the carotid bulb ruptured.	3.532076397495691
The suture line was not involved.	3.3736942954758042
In an emergency procedure the necrotized tissue was resected and repaired using a Dacron patch.	3.1272661792193492
Postoperatively the patient showed paresis of the left recurrent nerve but fortunately did not suffer any other neurological deficit.	3.622606583276449
Myocardial stunning (contractile dysfunction in the presence of normalized perfusion) and myocardial hibernation (contractile dysfunction matching reduced perfusion) have represented separate concepts of viable, but dyssynergic myocardium in the past.	3.2766919489072146
However, in vivo experimental and clinical work suggests that repetitive ischemia due to coronary artery disease may induce a gradual transition between stunned and hibernating myocardium.	3.065445611127887
Myocardial hibernation itself can result from a spectrum of ischemic conditions ranging from impaired myocardial blood flow reserve to frank hypoperfusion.	3.0639862919911054
With increasing severity and duration of ischemia, degeneration of cardiac myocytes, accumulation of glycogen and cell death ensue.	3.20500583185652
Additonally, there is an increase of extracellular matrix protein content leading to reparative fibrosis, which in turn limits functional recovery.	3.777409071012174
In the light of these structural features, the available methods for detection of viable myocardium, in particular dobutamine echocardiography and nuclear imaging techniques, offer complementary rather than contradictory information.	3.237344277338628
Dobutamine echo has satisfactory sensitivity, excellent specificity, and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of viable dyssynergic myocardium.	3.7312712866745703
While in the past only its predictive accuracy for segmental recovery has been validated, newer data show an improved survival after revascularization if at least four viable dyssynergic left ventricular segments in a 16 segment model can be identified by dobutamine echocardiography.	2.879953197115567
The complete (low and high dose) dobutamine protocol can elicit several types of contractile responses (sustained improvement in contraction or monophasic response, biphasic response, new wall motion abnormality) which should be interpreted in view of other clinical data including a previous infarction.	3.085638561136443
The test protocol can be used safely at the end of the first week after myocardial infarction.	4.200310499176993
If ischemia or viability is documented, revascularization should be performed promptly.	3.658567453761924
A similar strategy should be followed in the setting of chronic coronary heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction.	3.5611040324245677
Since the structural changes of hibernating myocardium are progressive, time to revascularization is critical.	3.2165120598252614
On the other hand, responsible therapeutic planning requires proof of ischemia or viability before initiating a potentially hazardous revascularization procedure.	2.525698359625086
The coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta.	3.416371003152447
The coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body.	4.231020126776392
The indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart.	3.4447606123854877
The resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end-to-end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a recoarctation.	4.1628958391354445
After a Vosschulte-aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen.	3.0678225465571547
This method, however, brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm.	5.027110815782724
In the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm 22 years after a Vosschulte-aortoplasty.	3.733154564154936
The aging of the Italian population is an emerging public health priority.	3.074864251231665
In 2025 Italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over 50 years old.	3.981683244815106
To avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations, we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs.	3.302686763995536
A 14 year old macedonic girl was admitted with recurrent colicky abdominal pain that had lasted for several weeks.	3.075683741381941
Laboratory check, plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show abnormalitities immediately.	3.292341019541481
Endoscopic retrograde choledocho-pancreaticography (ERCP) was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus.	3.478749204376865
It revealed a common-channel situation (ductus choledochus and pancreaticus) and choledocholithiasis.	3.0500244038527713
Papillotomy and stone-extraction could not remove abdominal pain.	3.180831447088803
Laparatomy and choledocho-jejunostomy could finally remove the symptoms.	2.9830042394662337
Successful transplantation of autologous chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage defects requires an undisturbed matrix-synthesis of the transplanted cells.	3.5317617196263775
This, in turn, is dependent on the composition of the synovial fluid (SF) of the respective joint.	3.865294116250018
We addressed the question whether analysis of a patient's SF can predict the rate of matrix-synthesis of articular cartilage exposed to this SF in vitro.	4.010055502275813
In the SF, the following parameters were determined: Interleukin-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1-RA, TNF, Insulin-like growth-factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), IGFBP-3 as well as total proteinase activity and total collagenase activity.	4.322294548114778
To assess the effect of SF on the matrix synthesis of articular chondrocytes, bovine cartilage was incubated in the presence of SF, and the rate of proteoglycan synthesis subsequently determined.	3.887296633610236
In some cases, a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-I was added.	3.3449862378588273
SF from patients with OA or trauma, respectively, stimulated PG-synthesis of bovine cartilage more markedly than did SF from patients with rheumatic arthritides.	3.280665455790317
On the average, 60 percent of the SF-induced increase of cartilage matrix synthesis could be titrated out by an anti-IGF-I-AB.	3.2493410035248345
The best predictor for the SF-effects on PG-synthesis of exposed cartilage was the proportion of free IGF-I (r = 0.573, p < 0.001, Spearman rank correlation) followed by the SF-concentrations of IGF-I (with a positive sign), IGFBP-3, IL-1, and TNF (all with a negative sign).	3.437329051718424
According to our data, IGF-I is the most important anabolic factor in human SF with respect to cartilage PG-synthesis.	4.054575869120258
The proportion of free IGF-I seems to be of special importance in this regard.	3.4340500290205123
Low SF-levels of free IGF-I could be identified as a possible risk-factor for a sub-optimal protoeglycan synthesis of chondrocytes exposed to this synovial milieu.	3.6071216986378
The coincidence between panic disorder and depression is a well known phenomenon.	3.5558359002168154
However, only few studies investigated the coincidence of panic disorder with schizophrenia.	3.154458531152426
This may in part be explained by the fact that both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may mask the clinical symptoms of a panic disorder.	3.4208010615519555
We report on a female patient suffering both from agoraphobia with panic disorder and paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10.	2.930871114274728
The productive psychotic symptoms responded well to treatment with a low dose of zotepine, whereas the panic disorder was effectively treated with a combined therapy with imipramine and cognitive behavioral therapy.	3.8963527632853525
Although it has to be questioned whether the coincidence between panic disorder and schizophrenia reflects two different diagnostic entities, the occurence of symptoms of a panic disorder in schizophrenia deserve further attention because these may be treated efficiently by a specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.	3.2180007968560886
A 54-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported.	2.824948104634768
Transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease.	3.57822319030435
After many years with only occasional disturbances, a distinct organic brain syndrome developed.	3.2006583803332025
Thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis; this was based on the history, liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in CT.	3.791699645355341
Despite the initiation of specific therapy, the patient died of the sequelae of the disease.	4.750227674858531
At autopsy, characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal leptomeningitis were found with collapsed parasitic cysts.	2.7569256549559706
Additional intracerebral mesenchymal-glial reactions were less conspicuous.	3.1718804894907726
Residual ependymitis had caused aqueductal stenosis.	3.312375844688914
Death was due to cachexia, bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess.	3.229065487732043
The clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed.	2.979469308446053
The disease has become rare in our country, but is globally the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system.	3.9853316964809102
The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence, etiology and prognosis of severe connatal anemia in preterm and term children.	3.077574601688861
In 18 of 18 367 (0.98 permil) liveborn neonates (birth weight 680-4050 g; 26-41 weeks of gestation), the initial hemoglobin level was below 10 g/dl.	3.2053071443197485
In those children with birth weight below 2500 g the incidence was 6.8 permil.	3.086071274918277
In 17 of 18 cases the cause of anemia could be clarified.	3.2528614263096043
In five preterm babies (28%) an acute fetofetal transfusion and in three newborns a fetomaternal transfusion was responsible for the onset of anemia.	3.4716115740461246
In two cases there was Rh incompatibility, in two cases placental bleeding, and in another two cases fetal tumour bleeding caused the anemia.	3.5446709833844174
In one fully developed newborn there was severe disseminated intestinal bleeding of unknown cause.	2.904190711931036
Another child suffered from EBV infection, and one had trisomy 13 with multiple malformations.	3.6738046703888165
Ten children (55%) had to be resuscitated due to hypovolemic shock.	3.5135619298496787
Fifteen children were intubated and ventilated mechanically.	3.336695567750003
Seven children (39%); (six preterm babies and the newborn with trisomy 13) died between days 1 and 6.	3.332474124376708
Five of these seven children had to be resuscitated at birth.	3.35629012778841
Five children (28%) including three full-term babies were developed normally.	3.407123893649207
In conclusion, severe anemia with hemoglobin below 10 g/dl is very rare but serious.	3.1440628060585314
It seems necessary to optimize primary resuscitation by immediate transfusion and monitoring of central venous pressure by umbilical vein catheter.	3.173007170740698
The prognosis can be influenced in a positive way.	3.613555578532855
Diagnosis of bacterial infection and/or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine.	3.920075577676837
White blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) due to noninfectious causes.	3.682084637003636
There is a number of non-infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and CRP elevation.	3.7704908352731605
In the last 3 years, Procalcitonin (PCT) was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection, especially sepsis.	3.418396635876196
PCT appears to have several advantages; it is of non-hepatic (yet unknown) origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency.	3.6849551428678042
There is no PCT-increase in acute graft-rejection, viral disease, and autoimmune disorders.	3.025513815565314
Some studys showed a prognostic value of PCT in sepsis due to peritonitis and pancreatitis.	3.1339416117916037
PCT appears to be a new and helpful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients.	3.39127038097538
Further studies are needed to finally established PCT in the daily management of critically ill patients.	2.8229021083782078
At this time significantly higher costs are the major detraction to daily or frequent measurements.	2.929613551238485
In this retrospective study, the meniscal status of 45 patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears is reported.	2.8808107042429376
The ACL injury was initially documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy.	3.241366393730354
Treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and bracing.	3.944397814700152
Twenty-nine (65%) patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of 3 years after the ACL injury during the follow-up period.	3.5532113354031365
Rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears.	4.286954987252658
The most common tear of the medial meniscus was the bucket-handle type, followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn.	3.522547024766663
Secondary reconstruction of the ACL was necessary in 24 patients complaining of the meniscus giving way.	4.297133687154281
The remaining five patients had rearthroscopy 4 years after the ACL injury and a partial meniscectomy and ACL reconstruction was performed.	3.4227696309485047
Sixteen patients (35% of the overall sample) had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow-up period, but discontinued their sporting activities.	3.40233571525697
Results indicate the increasing incidence of meniscal tears during ACL insufficiency.	3.305246288579779
We recommend that patients with ruptures of the ACL should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and mensical repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously.	3.8540312126412974
Four children, 4 to 10 years old, with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA; starting dosage 2 mg/kg per day) and prednisolone.	3.9067680790821835
All children had previously received systemic steroids and/or cytotoxic agents, which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects.	3.38137482591959
In one child, suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved.	3.6278702137678307
In a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function, although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage.	3.2101879002181017
In the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation.	3.452731715040897
During the time of treatment, ranging from 11 to 26 months, no serious side effects were observed.	3.8037926308072887
All patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia.	2.8622344441436725
Allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare.	3.0789488910251093
In most cases the reactions are caused by different red pigments.	3.083857180603157
While in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts (cinnebar) and cadmium sulphide, now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions.	3.0584077810153993
A 42-year-old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos.	3.0564483816202457
Histologically a chronic granulomatous, partly fibrous inflammation with transfollicular elimination of pigment granules was found.	2.8055138492477973
Spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed, simultaneously with depigmentation and scarring of the overlying skin.	3.6689164161660313
The pigment used for tattooing was found to be an aromatic azo derivative.	4.059316174201046
In addition to a positive cutaneous reaction to the dye, the patient also showed a positive patch test to Napthol AS, used for the coupling of different dyes in the textile industry.	3.522655908492835
Borrelia burgdorferi specific DNA has been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in different specimens of patients with Lyme disease (LD).	3.415250021860785
The aim of the present study is to evaluate PCR-diagnostic of urine specimens regarding rheumatologic diagnosis of Lyme disease.	2.751007043688536
Urine specimens of 77 patients  (LD, n=34; undifferentiated arthritis (UA), n=25; arthralgia/myalgia (AM), n=18) and 15 controls were investigated.	3.2347834076902173
Flagellin gene  (60 specimens) or OspA-plasmid  (32 specimens) were used as targets.	3.4127529044747464
Sensitivity of the flagellin-nested-PCR was 27%, by OspA-nested-PCR only one positive PCR result was found.	2.7192619521018426
Despite of low sensitivity PCR enabled the correct diagnosis of LD in two patients classified as UA.	3.4972308420268745
Therefore, PCR can give valuable hints in single cases if LD is clinically suspected.	2.9450392796864233
Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy of a chemically standardized willow bark extract in the treatment of osteoarthritis.	3.758330531921542
Methods: Willow bark extract, in a dose corresponding to 240mg salicin/day, was compared to placebo in a 2-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.	3.486609840572481
The primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index.	3.2243363793995177
Secondary outcome measures included the stiffness and physical function dimensions of the WOMAC, daily visual analogue scales (VAS) on pain and physical function, and final overall assessment by both patients and investigators.	3.361639685861411
Results: 78 patients (39 willow bark extract, 39 placebo) participated in the trial.	3.272708328696521
A statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo group was observed in the WOMAC pain dimension (d=6.5mm, 95%C.I.=0.2-12.7mm, p=0.047); the WOMAC pain score was reduced by 14% from baseline level after two weeks of active treatment, compared to an increase of 2% in the placebo group.	3.611497695703276
Patient diary VAS confirmed this result, and likewise the final overall assessments showed superiority of willow bark extract over placebo (patients assessment, p=0.0002; investigators assessment, p=0.0073).	2.9077514049775686
Conclusion: Willow bark extract shows a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis.	3.161499771797753
Background and methods: The aim of this study was to get more information about the prevalence of chronic pain in different practices of home physicians.	4.192267948370962
900 patients of five different specialists (general medicine, internal medicine, neurology, orthopaedics, surgery) in the german town Bochum were investigated with a questionnaire about chronic pain.	3.582206748261565
Chronic pain was defined as a continuous or intermittend pain of longer duration than six months.	3.568801384862253
Confusion between syncope and epileptic seizures is a common problem in clinical practice.	3.4873132866503864
Recently, new insights into the phenomenology of transient cerebral hypoxia have been gained from video analysis of experimentally induced syncope.	2.864271658474613
Common elements of syncope include multifocal and generalized myoclonus, tonic body extension, automatisms, vocalizations, eye deviations and hallucinations.	2.660809195278105
Thus, it is not the presence or absence of these features but their specific character that distinguishes syncope from epileptic seizures.	3.00663878866684
Other clues for differential diagnosis include precipitating factors, premonitory symptoms and postictal events, such as tongue bites and postictal confusion, which has been identified as the single most powerful factor discriminating syncope from epileptic seizures.	3.1803046260945527
In contrast, incontinence and head injury are common in both conditions.	3.0649114045806742
Investigations such as electroencephalogram, tilt testing and postictal prolactin or creatine kinase levels may aid diagnosis but are never diagnostic in isolation.	2.7430635465438074
In rare cases, hypoxic and epileptic mechanisms may interact within one attack.	2.870995582104218
In the past two decades increasing research efforts have focused on the molecular biology of the cell.	3.6110143088243496
In the beginning, these research activities were purely academic without any direct clinical relation.	3.0522438716884803
A series of important discoveries, initiated particularly by the unravelling of the genetic code and the discovery of the molecular basis of gene expression and genetics, the subsequent identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and finally the description of major mechanisms which induce genetic instability in cells, now indicate the way to many new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.	3.1757672904584764
In surgical oncology, these attempts are yielding the first clinical consequences.	3.194700897023397
Basic aspects of molecular cell biology as far as they are relevant for surgical oncologists are discussed.	2.9570809397939377
Pathophysiologically, it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors.	3.9643615662891283
Cofactors are, for instance, the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs.	4.758993203471501
In particular, the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction, development of a capillary leak, protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space.	3.221496356070806
An impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction.	3.4665096208249877
An arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the arteriolar pressure.	2.9429347734820723
An accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load.	3.1680573898805138
In disadvantageous cases, the patients are in danger of developing a multi-organ deficiency syndrome (MODS) by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction, by intravasal volume loss and by a myonephropathic systemic reaction.	3.6420200668902387
Clinically, the patients suffer a disproportionate amount of pain, followed by neurological signs.	3.5082195442401147
Especially in noncompliant patients, tissue pressure measurement is useful.	3.210018684086555
Resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of casts is important.	4.443579133275169
In case of a manifest cs, dermatofasciotomy has to be performed as an emergency operation.	4.446868383288798
The object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid-term and long-term follow-up.	3.049435100301781
During the period from January 1980 to June 1997 we performed 247 open (technique: 134 according to Eden-Hybbinette-Lange, 46 according to Weber, 26 according to Putti-Platt, 41 according to Bankart) and 76 arthroscopic (transglenoidal Morgan technique) shoulder stabilization procedures.	2.567734940322047
The mean follow-up for techniques was: Eden-Hybbinette-Lange 11.1 years (2.9-16.7 years), Weber 5.2 years (2.1-13.0 years), Putti-Platt 7.2 years (2.2-10.6 years), Bankart 1.6 years (0.5-3.2 years), and Morgan 3.5 years (2.8-5.1 years).	3.2641182171632757
We observed that the classic open Bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation, range of motion, sports activity, and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures.	3.569599010233816
The results shows that nonanatomical, reconstructive, open procedures are not up to date.	3.0524837676726944
The open Bankart procedure reconstructs the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only.	4.06034486915689
The classic open Bankart procedure seems to be the "gold standard" in open shoulder surgery today.	3.440517863993233
The high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more stringent patient selection in the future.	3.195464793594114
Background: Our study compared the haemodynamic changes after spinal anaesthesia with 2% lignocaine and 0,5% plain bupivacaine.	3.5566587563357293
Hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance.	4.301364171370012
When hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration, the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest.	4.144954740205463
Usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia.	3.307803281237164
Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, disorders of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, high-dose antibiotics, and immunsuppressive treatments may result in hyperkalemia.	3.7909069440608674
The most important pathogenetic mechanisms are (1) renal insufficiency, (2) hyporeninemic hypoaldeosteronism, (3) tubular disorders, and (4) cellular disorders.	3.9489060344379294
Background: CMV retinitis is the most common opportunistic ocular infection and the main cause of blindness in AIDS patients with a T-helper cell count <= 50/µl.	3.9880050299099064
Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half-life time after phosphorylation intracellularly.	3.2002433899787377
It is effective against CMV and can be given intravenously and intravitreally.	3.7182828484107135
The aim was to offer an alternative therapy for CMV retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it.	3.0535916336957234
The efficacy and tolerance of intravitreal injections of cidofovir should be evaluated.	2.8086185725276587
A case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported.	2.8556593950809988
One of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma, and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland.	2.9508733539676366
The relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata, dermal cylindroma and multiple trichoepitheliomata is discussed.	2.770208547591908
In view of the risks of a varicella infection during pregnancy and the more and more observed severe course of infection, varicella infection has to be considered as a serious disease.	3.823747037842344
The initial antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis has major implications for the course of the disease.	2.8559438034608333
The current spectrum of infectious agents must be considered.	3.0937129152501623
Antibiotics have to reach sufficient concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid for a bactericidal action to occur at the site of infection.	3.434821907482989
Frequent problems arising in this condition are: (1) the non-observation of listerial infections, (2) the use of antibiotics not sufficiently active against gram-positive bacteria in pneumococal meningitis, (3) the development of meningitis following the use of ciprofloxacin in respiratory tract infections, (4) the hasty change in antibiotic regimens in focal parenchymal infections during delayed response to therapy, (5) the use of bacteriostatic antibiotics, and (6) the delay in administering sufficient antibiotic therapy during fulminate meningococcal meningitis.	3.9198286174143484
Problems arising from these conditions are illustrated by case reports.	3.1803174645771035
Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease-modifying drugs aims towards better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy.	4.02751569031205
Based on a broad variety of clinical studies, revealing more or less positive results, several combinations have been suggested:...	3.3801533244483966
The management of 178 patients with liver trauma (132 male, 46 female; mean age 34 years (range 3-88) presenting from January 1979 to August 1996 is reviewed.	2.984489876186842
There were 165 cases of blunt trauma and 13 cases of penetrating injury.	3.074156042908979
110 cases were classified as simple injuries (grade I or II) and 68 cases as complex injuries (grade III to V).	3.8255007551785822
The overall mortality was 32 % (57 patients).	2.994070388824076
The mortality for true hepatic injury was 15.7 %.	3.1192604454507613
None of the patients with penetrating injuries died.	3.5678855555266376
Mortality was inflenced by the type of liver injury and the number of associated injuries.	4.175103385753704
The postoperative complication rate was 55 %.	3.6759365894929417
The most-frequent postoperative complications related to the hepatic injury were intrahepatic or subcapsular hematoma (12.9 %) and postoperative bleeding (9.6 %).	3.1471844436951857
Intraabdominal abscess formation was seen in 2.8 %.	4.099922993620561
Operative therapy for liver injuries depends on the grade of the injury.	4.000234139697721
The majority of liver injuries can be managed by simple techniques, including electrocautery and application of hemostatic agents.	3.0702304253733828
In complex injuries hepatotomy, direct vessel ligation, and debridement of necrotic tissue is the method of choice (Pachter's procedure).	3.160835289387935
Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate knowledge, practices, and opinions on tobacco and oral health among dentists of the Berlin Dental Association using a questionnaire.	2.814867450016614
Materials and methods: Questions focussed on smoking habits, knowledge about oral malignancies and premalignancies and practical approaches to screening for oral mucosal diseases and other associations of tobacco with oral changes.	2.849149403443836
The questions related to risk factors and behavioural counselling for patients and associated constraints.	4.04743731976419
Results: Of a total of 4000 questionnaires sent, 483 were received for evaluation (12.1%).	2.985757600713465
Of respondents 9.5% were regular smokers.	3.1951434441659567
The median number of oral malignancies observed was 3.	3.1418652768455826
Knowledge about some associations of oral changes such as wound healing was adequate.	3.135316621130185
A total of 93.1% of respondents would refer patients with oral lesions.	2.7804138924179016
Only 35% take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26.6% explain the side effects of tobacco.	3.3287744505132135
Limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti-tobacco counselling.	3.2057810877117188
Since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti-tobacco counselling, adequate programmes in Germany should be inititated and followed up.	3.205633894170409
Background: Last year's pilot study, which examined for the first time a representative group of patients with Chagas disease, showed that in this parasitosis changes in the ocular fundus can be expected in the form of defects of the retinal pigment epithelium.	4.40442310424917
Examination of more patients in this study should give further information about the character and extent of the alterations found.	3.9969193490190276
The authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation.	3.526335829761898
In that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint.	3.183345667854667
Finally they draw the readers attention to operative steps to prevent a reluxation of the shoulder joint.	3.0324011222144756
Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) has become the most important method in the workup of infantile cerebral complications after primary sonography.	3.437391979710239
Cerebral MR examination and image interpretation during the infantile period require extensive knowledge of morphological manifestations, their pathophysiological background, and frequency.	3.064405711134325
The choice of imaging parameters and image interpretation is demonstrated in infarctions and hemorrhages of the mature and immature brain.	2.9891732024516533
A review of the main differential diagnoses is also given.	3.536990693633294
The relevance of MR spectroscopy and fetal MRI is discussed.	3.006238965027831
Currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors.	4.0080506430015275
One of them is the precise handling of optics.	2.9580263656265773
Up to now, in our hospital 52 laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice - controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder, stomach, large bowel and hernia operations.	3.192411749962668
The visual field is determined by the surgeon.	4.217501026606323
In all cases handling of the robot arm was precise and the voice response exact and without technical problems.	2.826113080338205
Twenty-nine operations were done by one operator as "solo surgeries".	2.928534051645968
In 20 further cases there was one assistant.	3.546579335937238
A robot arm can be used successfully without problems by any laparoscopic surgeon in any operating theater.	3.4164037951587782
Urine specimens were collected from 49 persons up to 10 days after abstaining from cannabis use.	3.4251118556046074
Urine samples (n = 135) were investigated for free and conjugated 9-carboxy-11-nor tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) by LC/MS/MS and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) by GC/MS prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis.	3.0607057850770176
Concentrations for free and conjugated THCCOOH were measured with reference to 100 mg creatinine/dL urine.	3.5746542086282793
Cannabis use was classified as light, moderate and heavy according to the current literature.	4.20361350376566
In all groups chosen free and bound THCCOOH was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day.	3.581557262159349
Urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of THCCOOH and THCCOOH glucuronide.	3.1871382915035356
Within 4-6 days the concentrations of free and glucuronidated THCCOOH in urine samples of heavy users decreased to those ranges present in urine samples of moderate and light users.	3.3599909620826534
In frequent users, THC glucuronide and 11-OH-THC glucuronide could be found up to 1 and 3 days after abstinence, respectively.	3.2627479525538905
In light users, neither THC glucuronide nor 11-OH-THC glucuronide was detectable.	2.7139568674782324
The determination of conjugated THC and 11-OH-THC in addition to free and bound THCCOOH is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use, but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption.	3.546239010294156
The participation of social work in inpatient psychiatric care is generally considered necessary, but there is a lack of empirical studies in this field.	3.7723116890373647
The analyses presented of a systematic documentation of social work interventions in 2038 cases during an 11-year period demonstrate that social workers are mostly involved in the treatment of chronic and previously treated patients.	3.6386533523277933
Interventions in younger patients, most of whom are suffering from psychoses, aim at rehabilitation through activity; in elderly patients with organic or depressive disorders, the major concern is to improve posthospital care; patients with neurotic or personality disorders comprise another group with a chronic course and a relatively poor outcome.	3.4231740034105584
As far as their goals are comparable, social workers and doctors agree on their objectives.	2.9540034352927527
Social workers usually see their own interventions as successful, but patient groups who benefit greatly can be differentiated from groups with poor outcome.	3.0667888121774873
Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscular rigidity and superimposed spasms.	3.9172628269603798
The etiology is still unknown and an autoimmune cause is discussed.	3.5194179157466827
Many differential diagnoses of muscular rigidity and of induration of the skin have to be considered.	3.7307710897395276
A 22 year old patient was admitted under suspicion of a stiff-man syndrome.	3.5863057372033498
He has had developed a painful rigidity of the trunk, starting in the neck.	3.6582206699611626
Massive stiffness of the trunk with pale appearance of the skin and a beginning disorder of swallowing and respiration were observed.	3.8081634398435784
Clinical investigation, EMG, cerebrospinal fluid and laboratory findings were all normal, thus excluding a stiff-man syndrome and other neuromuscular diseases.	3.1358039342497213
Skin biopsy showed typical changes of Buschke's scleredema adultorum, a rare connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology.	2.8874625839751302
Therapy with corticosteroide and ciclosporin led to a mild improvement of symptoms.	3.1251375361352363
Although rare, Buschke's scleredema adultorum should be regarded as a differential diagnosis of the stiff man syndrome.	3.461949031539728
Urogenital infections are established as hazards to male fertility.	3.219732679433358
Various pathophysiological hypotheses have evolved from experimental and clinical studies, facilitating explanation of the effects of bacteria and immunological events on reproductive tissues.	3.580399412667184
Numerous current studies have identified and evaluated infectious mediators accounting for specific molecular events in urogenital infections.	3.086799455247146
X-ray or CT images allow only a limited three-dimensional orientation in presurgical planning.	3.5820072180214937
Especially for the planning of internal hemipelvectomies with custom-made endoprosthesis and for periacetabular osteotomies a high-grade orientation is necessary.	3.262211724578183
This orientation is improved by a 3D CT-controlled manufactured 1:1 model of the pelvis.	3.7968319836454527
This enables an exact classification of defect and deformity, planning of resection planes, design of the suitable custom-made implant and simulation of the operation technique as preoperative quality control.	3.192539934506597
An Ivalon-plug (PDA-plug) has been developed for transvenous closure of patent ductus arteriosus.	3.1585389380670725
It can be introduced into the ductus through standard venous sheaths with a diameter von 8-16 French.	3.187068394577638
The plug is fixed in its target position by means of four distal (aortal) and two proximal (pulmonary) nitinol struts.	3.311836589637789
In case of malpositioning the system can be pulled back into and retrieved through the sheath.	2.9443121165531028
In animal experiments endothelialization of the implanted material was demonstrated.	3.1624467228028106
PDA-closure was attempted in 58 patients; the procedure was successful in 57 cases; a residual ductal flow was present in eight patients.	3.802449611482145
During a follow-up of up to 24 months there were no complications.	4.331411127314497
Using 8 different monoclonal antibodies, immunohistology was performed on 36 follicular adenomas and on 28 follicular, 34 papillary, 27 medullary and 29 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid.	3.3241839417614387
The panel of antibodies was directed against broad-spectrum cytokeratins (pan-CK, antibody lu-5), against basic and acid high-molecular-weight CK of types  1, 5, 10 and 14, against basic ( 5 and 6) and acid high-molecular-weight CK ( 13) and against basic ( 7 and  8) and acid low-molecular-weight CK ( 19 and  20).	3.094304325511933
With the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas, nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan-CK, CK 8 and CK 19.	2.846979065940596
CK 20 expression was exclusively shown for 2 medullary carcinomas.	3.3123149379134613
Reactivity for high-molecular-weight CK could only, each time focally, be demonstrated for 14 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas and for 2 anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation.	3.156081237579236
Thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not decorated by any of the CK antibodies applied.	3.323836063839052
CK 7 staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in 26 papillary cancers.	3.6346377156721044
In contrast, such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma, medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with 5 follicular carcinomas.	3.3213463843287716
These results confirm earlier studies in that CK 20 expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad-spectrum CK antibodies.	3.0729890418819443
New is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non-papillary thyroid tumours regarding CK 7 expression.	3.1447742829871594
This result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern.	3.034866405982903
Purpose: To compare reading speed and reading comfort between closed-circuit television systems (CCTVs) with different image refresh rates.	2.7710372191484534
This surveillance study presents a literature review concerning the very inhomogeneous care emphasis of the acute psychosocial crisis both with respect to crisis insight and therapy methods and to professional responsibility.	3.503443444790224
In detail general care models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention are described, as well as disorder- and event-specific concepts and papers on crisis intervention with children, teen-agers, and adolescents of the last 10 years.	3.289683282176755
In addition, the contributions of the empirical psychotherapy research and their results are presented as far as they are relevant to crisis intervention.	3.0663223730003732
In recent years many different systems for transcatheter closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD) have been developed and tested.	3.0974711797425116
However, all systems presently available have some special disadvantages.	2.927564764464094
The recently introduced Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO), though, appears promising.	2.698965761314287
It is a self-expanding and self-centering double disc made from a Nitinol mesh, which is tightly woven to give mechanical strength.	3.2326963091760783
Both discs are separated by a connecting cylindrical portion.	3.2112521793058137
Its diameter may be chosen, so that it corresponds to that of the ASD.	3.7390828430257304
In the light of recent research findings the inappropriateness of many commonly accepted concepts in psychosomatic medicine is discussed.	2.569757856177139
They do not stand up to empirical scrutiny.	3.25265885129928
This applies both to sepcifity models and to duality of body and mind or of illness and health.	2.845952670203456
The monocausal-psychogenetic view was replaced through a complex interplay of hierarchie somato-psychic circles which are to be integrated into a biosemiotic model.	2.919936203907792
In terms of the self-object-body system a greater significance is attached to affects in the communication and acting receives an important interactive function.	2.9188870949875327
The effects of the altered theroretical positions on new therapy approaches are discussed.	3.0647408427221134
Perioperative, mostly silent ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease is difficult to detect by clinical examinations.	4.265810050983662
Herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease-causing microorganisms.	3.8063935090910723
Their prevalence can exceed 90% depending on the socioeconomic status of the population.	3.6250650109087603
Since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation, herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance.	4.200823374754403
While treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences.	3.0563076514743264
Additionally, development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment.	3.4533739667427903
Possible causes for the development of resistance in herpes infections and the use of famciclovir and forscarnet as two therapeutic alternatives to aciclovir are discussed.	3.750144095668485
Tumor invasion of the portal vein by ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is classically known as a criterion for inoperability.	3.176248542990487
Despite improvement in operation techniques for portal vein resection during Whipple's procedure and acceptable mortality and morbidity, in the case of uncertain tumor infiltration vascular resection cannot be recommended in general.	3.415437233333133
The problem is the preoperative detection of tumor infiltration of the portal vein.	3.4685281790231106
Often the surgeon is confronted with unsuspected macroscopic portal vein infiltration or tumor adhesion during the operation.	2.9091416201877673
Between 1986 and 1995 105 patients underwent Whipple's procedure for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head in our department.	2.766218632449277
In eight of these cases partial portal vein resection was performed because of macroscopic tumor infiltration or tumor adhesion.	3.4386450901872005
In all eight cases the preoperative diagnostic procedures with CT and portography did not show any suspicion of tumor infiltration.	3.3924635086708026
In four of the eight cases histological tumor infiltration of all vascular layers was found.	3.2253217428759138
In the others we found no or only adventitial tumor invasion.	3.1194001341803657
The patients without tumor infiltration of the portal vein showed a survival time after surgery of 27.78 months in contrast to 6.67 months in the group with histologically proven tumor infiltration.	3.611891855168996
Endovascular, intraportal ultrasound (IPEUS), a new diagnostic procedure, can give helpful information regarding portal vein involvement.	3.76255959454628
Although the IPEUS is not a standard diagnostic procedure it was shown to detect portal vein infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity.	3.750850197993742
Our results indicate that in such cases where portal vein infiltration has been excluded by IPEUS, patients with macroscopic tumor adhesion do benefit from partial portal vein resection.	3.187648323684774
Progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies.	3.1203736778577893
This does also apply for stroke treatment: New pathophysiological knowledge, positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the demostrated importance of early treatment at Stroke Units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency.	3.2405895153993143
Timing is of utmost importance.	3.300107309313498
Time-based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy.	3.2766988620620787
The treatment process is divided into three phases: alarming, pre-hospital and in-hospital phase.	3.7823039408928096
The effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables (personnel, technical equipment, course of the disease, etc.).	3.2932743607267163
Knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses, which allows an aimed improvement, e.g.	2.837279349094779
public education, training of paramedics and medical personnel.	3.461594065159904
Modern communication systems allow new information transfer, which can help to avoid unnecessary transport of patients.	4.367953954554434
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a severe complication after heart valve replacement.	4.099000979335871
Incidence ranges in literature between 0.1% and 2.3% (mean 0.4%) per patient year (pty).	2.9553292985172184
PVE is classified as "early" or "late" (occurence within or after 60 days following heart valve replacement).	3.321227242981078
In this review we present the clinical outcome of PVE as well as the most common diagnostic criteria (Duke criteria), the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria.	4.900738261571475
The spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards.	3.9724869053757885
Recently intra-atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.	3.9231255948834507
Low-energy intra-atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus rhtyhm f.ex.	3.333773922881328
after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided.	3.547797768130393
Intra-atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method, but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far.	3.659558286791552
Especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy.	3.0649142210623865
Modern imaging techniques are a substantial part of treatment planning for minimally invasive radiotherapeutic procedures.	3.2492932475315977
The aim is three-dimensional assessment of the target volume and adjacent critical structures.	4.01351073671929
In this paper, we report on our clinical experience with a precise system for stereotactic image correlation.	3.196647815224534
Hereby, the advantages of each imaging modality can be combined.	3.37466439874746
Precise immobilization of the patient is a prerequisite.	5.770462868101463
The immobilization method has an accuracy of less than 1 mm.	3.849111122269421
This method was evaluated in a clinical study in which a tumor control rate of 93 % was achieved in patients with brain metastases after stereotactic single high dose radiotherapy.	4.072248251421232
This indicated the excellent reliability of this treatment planning method.	3.616630273493523
Olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (IPS).	3.783630272876779
In contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of IPS, clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed.	3.440992224133971
This may be due to the lack of an easy-to-use,  inexpensive, standardized, and reliable test.	3.720295079270748
In this study, we administered the newly developed "sniffin' sticks" test to a group of 40 nondemented IPS patients and compared the results with 40 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and smoking habits.	3.2394102168338246
In all three subtests including odor identification, odor detection threshold, and odor discrimination, the control group scored significantly better than the IPS group, yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90% each.	3.0439598172781483
Our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in IPS can be found at early stages of the disease, appear bilaterally, and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism.	3.1950673228815987
Therefore, we emphasize that olfactory testing may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of IPS.	3.8375177360798243
Purpose: The goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional MRI to establish computer-based, preoperative therapy planning for tumors, instancing cervical carcinoma.	3.728013467090079
Toxic metabolic and immunologic products in the serum have been discussed as possible causes.	3.4724213030280238
For this reason we have performed plasmapheresis on these patients for many years.	3.0543239512948674
Results regarding survival and healing of the lesions are quite favorable, as exemplified with two patients described here who benefited from the procedure despite their old age.	3.3229718802669344
In dermis and epidermis, there was a striking increase of macrophages and a relative increase of CD8-positive lymphocytes which might act as cytotoxic effector cells; these findings can be interpreted as the result of an immunological reaction.	3.405448477895662
An increased staining of lesional epidermis with TNF, as previously noted by other autors, should be interpreted with caution since necrotic cells are involved.	2.910245560087786
On the basis of the clinical results, the pathogenetic considerations, and in view of the lack of specific treatment modalities, clinical studies concerning plasmapheresis for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis are recommended, particularly since this procedure is widely available and generally well tolerated.	3.9668589352950696
The majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery.	3.0018350230481583
In problematic cases, however, optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved.	3.5591045173621887
In these cases, external frontal sinus surgery is indicated.	3.1761982264464583
Impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation.	3.1766114166748447
Its problematic nature is unfolded on a report of two cases, one with a Küntscher nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail.	3.502855007706559
This event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively.	3.5639158784398086
The new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to jam against the cortex.	3.5589664612636636
Both, the slot of the unlocked reamed clover leaf nail and the wider dorsal flute of the solid titanium nail, realize certain therapeutic concepts.	2.6499558630562974
Their factual benefit within the concept of interlocking nailing is doubtful.	3.3222911016219916
Secreting germ cell tumors that predominantly appear in the pineal region are characterized by elevated levels of -HCG and AFP in CSF.	3.1169617284632762
Adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate.	3.8463496022972667
We present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of -HCG in CSF.	2.894318825508045
Six years before, a pineocytoma of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy.	3.100253738675716
This demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline-sized brain-tumors by evaluation of -HCG and AFP in CSF and serum.	3.75816724571409
Today, different therapeutic strategies depending on the histological diagnosis are available and justify a high priority of a surgical tumor biopsy.	3.752487858823032
However, the value of stereotaxic procedures remains controversial.	3.0944461988024456
Recently published data gave evidence of a definite improved prognosis of secreting CNS germ cell tumors following combined treatment with high-dose polychemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation of the tumor area.	4.048613519523954
-HCG and AFP may serve as useful markers to enable follow-up of the disease.	3.3017191226258595
In order to get a better data management of complications in orthopedic surgery and in order to get comparable statistics a standardisation of nomenclature and classification of complications is demanded since 1.1.1997.	3.324155407646072
The Orthopedic University Clinic of Heidelberg started with a register of all early complications of all inpatients.	3.102667370142012
According to a standardized nomenclature all occured complications the doctors put in the data of complications in a database.	3.580903782439833
These data were controlled, complemented and classified by members of the quality menagement group.	3.293134595821384
This guideline consists of five parts: catalogue of diagnoses, general and special definitions, classification and an allocation table of diagnoses to grades of severity.	2.9967599003152445
The internet plays an important role in a growing number of medical applications.	3.8011651845419387
Finding relevant information is not always easy as the amount of available information on the Web is rising quickly.	3.944299796365219
Even the best Search Engines can only collect links to a fraction of all existing Web pages.	2.913151141455199
In addition, many of these indexed documents have been changed or deleted.	2.8647001913027066
The vast majority of information on the Web is not searchable with conventional methods.	2.8611369423293667
New search strategies, technologies and standards are combined in Intelligent Search Agents (ISA) and Robots, which can retrieve desired information in a specific approach.	3.0986941856631436
With the availability of modern imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), diagnostic options in the evaluation of Marfan patients have been improved profoundly.	3.6024614408939017
The most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall, immunofluorescence studies or pulse chase analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts, and molecular analysis at the cDNA/DNA level of the fibrillin-1 gene.	3.019153629503076
New diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised nosologic criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.	3.2871671077796516
The diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed: moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic Marfan syndrome are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence, gravidity as well as in the pre- and postoperative patient.	4.445641285468625
Primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias, dysostoses and dysplasias.	3.0407139509882457
Hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal.	3.438620092097998
Generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy 21 and Ullrich-Turner syndrome.	2.699282573686904
Dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis.	3.171089370276617
Many of them are caused by mutations of single genes in the cascade of morphogenetic gene sequences.	3.2605806911234434
Dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue.	3.5508259281494214
Some of them (e. g. achondroplasia, Jansen type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia) are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation.	2.801730048324991
Others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components.	2.9916693772546
Examples are collagenopathies such as osteogenesis imperfecta and some spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias.	2.724778169782287
Finally, disorders such as pycnodysostosis, result from defects of chondro-osseous homeostasis.	2.947694389846439
The study of skeletal defects helps to unravel the complexity of normal skeletal development.	2.9972150882601594
Human parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) and aplastic crisis.	2.8829843264401562
In pregnancy, B19 may be transmitted on to the fetus resulting in hydrops fetalis.	3.1850351156594043
B19 is sometimes associated with thrombocytopenia and vasculitis.	3.21554962120761
In immunocompromised patients, B19 may persist causing chronic infection.	3.3158641892374345
Several methods for detecting B19 virus or specific antibodies are now available.	3.0965714564807603
B19 infection does not usually require therapy.	3.357697085917861
Efficacy of immunoglobulins in chronic B19 infection has been demonstrated.	3.9273325677084667
In absence of significant symptoms and signs, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains difficult.	4.14021909327216
Sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and ECG on their own is low.	3.63502546508441
Echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload.	3.417589274880706
Venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected PE, but normal results do not rule out PE.	3.843109418148398
Helical CT with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli.	3.5499869105153223
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment, several diagnostic techniques, and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases.	3.531103503356926
Heparin remains the standard therapy for patients with stable hemodynamics.	4.6773151351392706
Thrombolytic therapy is recommended in hemodynamically compromised patients.	3.5982266686706117
In short-term dose regimes, the thrombolytic agents urokinase, streptokinase, and rt-PA seem to be equally efficient.	3.5838276492418695
So far, however, no study has proven that thrombolytic therapy significantly reduces mortality in pulmonary embolism.	3.3904057616638132
Background: Data on mesopic vision after LASIK are not available to date.	3.1857241449905436
We therefore evaluated mesopic vision in myopic eyes before and after LASIK.	3.2848572842001125
Renal tubular dysgenesis is a rarely recognized condition characterized by oligohydramnios, Potter's sequence and congenital anuria leading to stillbirth or neonatal death from respiratory failure.	2.6705554786107504
It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.	3.032617219942308
Definitive diagnosis is based on renal histology, revealing the lack of proximal tubule differentiation.	4.026441152475863
Two additional cases of affected sibs in a family with parental consanguinity are reported.	3.24305004552488
Lectin and immunohistochemical studies confirmed structural and functional immaturity of the proximal tubule.	3.9133196817425366
Further findings include bilateral renal vein thrombosis.	3.250262798401865
The clinical and morphological parameters defining this disorder and the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed.	3.2469807709462275
Articular cartilage has only a small capacity for regneration.	3.6315887690538675
This makes the repair of articular surfaces difficult.	3.5364755305970976
In 1959 Pridie described his method of resurfacing osteoarthritic knee joints.	2.9501971758099694
This operation is still in widespread use today.	3.480478867872444
Pridie introduced the principle of drilling exposed subchondral bone with the objective of encouraging a fibro-cartilaginous repair.	3.2537031165898678
The newly formed fibrocartilaginous layer that develops over the lesion in osteoarthritis may be enough to decrease patients symptoms.	3.068901726535138
Bone drilling into the subchondral layer is also effective in promoting healing of osteochondrosis dissecans.	3.1161536904006075
The choice of the treatment should be based on factors such as age of the patient, serverity of symptoms, activity level and functional demands on the joint, site and stage of the lesion.	4.44442329848383
The drilling operation remains useful in osteoathritis and osteochondrosis dissecans.	2.8490972897566165
Recent immunobiological findings together with advances in biotechnology, ameliorations in clinical trial design, and MRI developments have led to a variety of therapeutical approaches in multiple sclerosis (MS).	3.2446477981841815
However, in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments, a number of therapeutical failures exist as well: despite impressive data from animal models, convincing concepts, and promising phase I/II studies, some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials, or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects.	3.2195608312315023
This article provides an overview of clinical studies that have failed or been abandoned for other reasons.	3.3262556897225313
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -antagonists which have led to negative effects in two studies (Lenercept, Infliximab) are discussed in detail.	3.4105201632381275
These results raise critical questions concerning the hypothetical pathogenesis of MS lesions and the value of MRI in the assessment of clinically relevant therapeutic drug effects.	3.4797523489002584
In addition to a description of the immunobiological background, studies on the immunosuppressive agents linomide, deoxyspergualin, sulfasalazine and cladribine, trials for the cytokines interleukin-10 and TGF-2, the studies on remyelination by intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), oral tolerance, and extracorporeal photopheresis are discussed.	2.8985748593000547
Isolated pancreatic metastases from renal-cell carcinomas (RCC) are extremely rare.	3.2362880810483357
Only 96 cases of clinically diagnosed renal-cell carcinoma metastatic to the pancreas have been reported in the world literature, and 70 of the patients (including ours) underwent a definitive surgical resection.	4.022764100431076
In many cases the time between the nephrectomy and diagnosis of metachronous metastases is reported to exceed 10 years.	3.1275985720945014
Therefore, the initial diagnosis may be overlooked when there is a prolonged disease-free interval.	3.9547486075770815
When it does occur simultaneously or metachronously, aggressive surgical resection, when possible, seems to be the most effective treatment for this metastatic lesion.	3.5704469973680606
Surgical resection can provide long-term survival in selected cases.	3.440589582166357
The patient simultaneously presented with both a mass in the body of the pancreas and a right-sided colon cancer.	3.5380508234868953
Thus, the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer was suspected initially.	3.9253678809842567
Both tumors were radically resected, and histological examination revealed two pancreatic metastases from the previous RCC.	3.5570883752993327
It illustrates a rare indication of pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis.	3.3445583185819574
The need for prolonged follow-up of patients is emphasized.	3.63520708651109
The few reports on surgically treated pancreatic metastases from RCC are reviewed after the presentation of this case.	3.471724003512143
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively disconcerting convictions with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder.	3.0015017870452576
The perceptions from which delusions arise are dynamically charged according to their role in the structural context.	3.559863255835861
The realisation pressure that burdens the perceptions and is intensified in psychotic constitutions is a precondition for the delusion.	2.7377239836415406
The failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic disorganisation of the structure is also a requirement.	3.3432521474090753
Based on a case study, considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification.	3.7322604641463255
High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis.	3.7312338606943007
The selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist, as the indication has to be carefully established.	3.8532656588785095
Exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions.	3.240075941011154
Prior to HDCT haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional-dose chemotherapy plus G- or GM-CSF stimulation.	3.27398457181648
HDCT consists of a combination of carboplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide.	3.7653301584697836
After HDCT, haematologic monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential.	3.066956754444424
It is therefore recommended that HDCT only be administered at specialized centres.	2.8281003967661498
Pyoderma gangrenosum develops in most patients between the age of 25 and 54 years.	3.7778265324819347
It usually occurs in otherwise healthy persons or in association with a systemic desease.	3.6878158568670703
Several clinical variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been described.	2.9805449627869454
Extremely painful ulcerations are characteristic and evolve rapidly.	3.20771184102042
Malignant pyoderma, the variant described in our case report, is an aggressive variant of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum, rapidly progressive and a potentially lethal ulcerative disease.	3.413536836758854
The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum depends on recognition of the evolving clinical features because histopathologic changes are not specific and characteristically serological or hematological markers of the disease do not exist.	3.302302678455803
We report on a 36-year-old male patient, who underwent surgery for repair of an aneurysm of the aortic arch.	3.8049304240419173
The aneurysm occurred two months after exacerbation of a malignant variant of pyoderma gangrenosum with nearly lethal exit.	3.4404211980252684
We could demonstrate successful perioperative treatment for prevention of exacerbation of pyoderma gangrenosum with prednisone and clofazimine	3.421932004991564
Background and purpose: To test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts.	3.0175553807264226
Defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit.	3.4931519157837325
For the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko-ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the primar loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency.	2.9683575199268057
The main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko-ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures.	3.576146210093806
With a transpedicular screw-ringband-system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished.	2.901890145702007
After rigid instrumentation with a fixateur intern remained a residual range of motion due to which can result refuse to bending moments without spondylodesis in an implant failure.	3.1055383532114287
CT- or MRI-guided stereotactic procedures should be a standard in a modern neurosurgical unit.	3.5365490155748103
Analysing 71 cases the indications and results of stereotactic neurosurgery are presented.	3.696326199891701
In 53 patients stereotactic serial biopsies of different intraaxial lesions were performed, in 5 patients a spontaneous haemorrhage of the basal ganglia was removed by lysis with r-tPA.	3.256121483291598
In 3 patients an intracerebral abscess was aspirated and drained.	3.0027634220317214
A stereotactic guided craniotomy and excision of small deep-seated lesions was performed in 6 cases.	3.856354020050721
The accuracy of stereotactic tumour biopsies was 88.7 % in our series, in accordance to other authors.	3.261541833993178
The stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics.	3.3112274290486043
The stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal invasiveness and low operative risk.	3.8924144724292202
The aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r-tPA or urokinase.	2.8921536279956515
With stereotactic guidance small, deep-seated intraaxial lesions can be well localized and removed.	3.143954646157405
Radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages (T1-T2).	4.122061124113476
In locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality.	3.2284256758732046
Recent developments in linear accellerator technique, the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time.	2.921118371491699
These improvements may possibly reduce the rate of therapy related side effects or complications significantly.	3.665508228558927
The combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone.	3.714257092633354
In special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated.	4.115334917449525
Future developments (i. e. intensity modulated radiotherapy - IMRT, combined thermo-radiotherapy, proton- or neutrontherapy) may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer.	3.5620964252971206
Skin is the second most common site of extranodal lymphoma.	3.2698128919549876
The significance of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years.	3.371804105885773
Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas represent a heterogenous group of entities which show variation in histology, immunophenotype and in prognosis.	2.9619660942861765
The most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas, marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	2.871052440930995
The majority of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis.	3.165914149291308
Whereas in B-cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependant on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma.	3.948179476449654
It is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph-node-based counterparts.	3.03402699347487
In the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas is discussed according to the WHO classification sheme.	3.129012490865491
The phencyclidine derivative ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with the thalamo-neocortical projection system as the primary site of action.	2.9386428534659124
Racemic ketamine consists of the enantiomers S(+)-ketamine and R(-)-ketamine.	2.9683625271090577
Racemic ketamine has never been considered an adequate anaesthetic agent in neurosurgical patients since  it produces regionally specific stimulation of cerebral metabolism (CMRO2) and increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP).	2.7972759853986418
However, recent experiments suggest that both tracemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine may reduce infarct size in animal models of incomplete cerebral ischaemia and brain injury.	3.1194885031750985
This experimental protective effect appears to be related to decreases in Ca++ influx and maintenance of brain tissue magnesium levels due to NMDA and quisqualate receptor blockade by ketamine.	3.1223353487085395
Studies in dogs have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) increases CBF in the presence of the cerebral vasodilator N2O.	3.073009542153099
In contrast, studies in rats without background anaesthesia showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p.).	2.6934208001510256
This suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	2.2598964136840967
Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was maintained regardless of the baseline cerebrovascular resistance.	3.380168194595315
There are several mechanisms by which racemic ketamine may increase CBF.	2.93091651930861
It induces dose-dependent respiratory depression with consequent mild hypercapnia in spontaneously ventilating subjects.	2.9958772783380234
This produces vasodilation due to the intact cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity.	3.882028661222633
Racemic ketamine also induces regional neuroexcitation, which leads to stimulation of cerebral glucose consumption in the limbic, extrapyramidal, auditory, and sensory-motor systems.	2.9876251512369767
This regional neuroexcitation with increased CMRO2 produces increases in CBF that can be blocked by infusion of barbiturates or benzodiazepines.	3.2998641307501786
However, increases in CBF with racemic ketamine (1 mg/kg) may also occur during normocapnia and without changes in CMRO2.	3.768826803763088
However, studies in rats have shown that CBF autoregulation was maintained with low- and high-dose S(+)-ketamine.	3.729830598192286
Infusion of racemic ketamine alters intracranial volume and ICP.	3.5378199064662983
Studies in spontaneously ventilating pigs with and without intracranial hypertension have shown that racemic ketamine (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) produces increases in PaCO2 and ICP.	3.2860146165955006
In contrast, identical experiments with mechanical ventilation and controlled PaCO2 showed no changes in ICP following racemic ketamine infusion.	2.876644708823103
This implies that increases in ICP are related to inadequate ventilation with consecutive hypercapnia and increases in intracranial blood volume.	3.159268445779094
Experiments in mechanically ventilated dogs indicate that racemic ketamine (2 mg/kg) increases cerebral blood volume and ICP even in the presence of normoventilation, a response that is reversible by hyperventilation or the administration of diazepam.	3.490981008126941
Studies in patients have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) reduces CBF in the presence of cerebral vasodilators like halothane or N2O.	3.066928634436191
In contrast, studies in unanaesthetised humans showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (2-3 mg/kg).	3.0545095737118495
This observation is consistent with animal studies and suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	2.368796657947126
Dengue-Fever is a mosquito transmitted viral disease.	3.1184159544837833
It is endemic mainly in South-East Asia and Afrika.	2.834710760706859
The clinical manifestation is divided into different stages.	3.278147722165063
Ocular manifestations in travellers have been rarely reported.	3.2405174452897993
Sufficient and regular wetting of the cornea with a normal preocular tear film is an essential requirement for the accurate visual functioning of the eye.	3.2731090838428587
Multiple factors may cause tear film instability.	3.3672581163356887
Measuring the break-up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary, clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability.	3.3459054866721845
We designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break-up phenomena.	3.2748279707484826
The prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities in Hamburg (1985-1997) was investigated with respect to epidemiological, forensic and morphological aspects.	3.1284312039265383
The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities (drug deaths) in Hamburg from 1985 to 1997, (2) to assess the rate of multiple infections and (3) to analyze the liver histomorphology in 100 autopsied drug deaths.	3.5474930045195765
Furthermore, we discuss the epidemiological and forensic aspects.	3.552316919572602
In this period 1469 drug deaths were registered with a prevalence for HBV of 35% (1997: 39%), for HCV 51% (1997: 58%), and for HIV 7% (1997: 15%).	3.5817327145614115
Co-infections were common (28%) and 19% of all cases were infected with HBV and HCV.	3.8233679738196007
The liver histology showed that hepatitis was frequently diagnosed (74%) and was associated with HBV and/or HCV infections (77% of all hepatitis cases).	3.5071785422345556
Only 9% showed a normal liverhistology.	3.385337466146432
Forensic autopsies and monitoring of HBV, HCV and HIV infections in drug deaths represent an important tool to gain information about the individual case and the situation among i.v.	3.677594639275084
Background: An abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.	3.650898169703326
Our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina, only moderately elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (168 +/- 33 mg/dl), and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal (n=9) or slightly abnormal (n=9) coronary arteriograms (minimal disease with luminal irregularities and/or diameter reduction <=30%) before and after 6-month lipid-lowering therapy (simvastatin).	3.442658229804288
Methods: Regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation (0.56 mg/kg) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and N-13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3-compartment kinetic model.	3.14289594732013
Baseline data (mean +/- SD): 13 males, 5 females; mean age: 56 +/- 8 years; basal coronary flow: 90 +/- 22 ml/minx100 g; after lipid intervention: 93 +/- 18 ml/minx100 g (n.s.).	3.040806432479182
Total cholesterol decreased to 170 +/- 36 mg/dl (p<0.001); mean LDL level: 97 +/- 26 mg/dl (p<0.001).	3.264505197216433
Coronary dilator capacity increased, assessed in terms of minimal coronary resistance: 0.38 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.09 units at baseline (p<0.01), myocardial blood flow under dipyridamole: 232 +/- 43 vs 186 +/- 37 ml/minx100 g at baseline (p<0.01), and instantaneous flow ratio: 2.6 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.6 (p=0.06).	3.0115774536324973
Concomitantly, a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients.	3.8043238807740107
Conclusions: An improvement of the non-invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after 6 months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis.	3.6031142471762725
Consequently, aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and antianginal approach suggesting, at least in part, functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression.	2.8530347991900222
We report the case of a a 60 year-old worker in the pharmaceutical industry who suffered from recurring contact dermatitis.	3.229547824754714
Initially the contact dermatitis was limited to the hands; later on it became generalized.	3.291393536264012
The patient had been working on a drug filling line in a pharmaceutical plant for more than 20 years.	3.1507057804226974
Eight years after starting this job he had developed allergic hand dermatitis to 2,6-diaminopyridine (patch test positive); this healed upon cessation of exposure.	2.805371135306674
Ten years later he again developed hand dermatitis which progressed to generalized dermatitis and conjunctivitis.	3.0011709691074695
Under systemic and local therapy with corticosteroids and cessation of work, it healed nearly completly.	3.202586900426598
Four months after returning to work, the patient experienced a first episode of severe asthma and generalized dermatitis with conjunctivitis following exposure to hydroxychloroquine the day before.	3.554571656322534
His condition continued to fluctuate, when though the patient was transferred at work and now wore rubber gloves.	3.2451725324081813
Eight months later he again developed a generalized dermatitis.	3.4343941786144563
Patch testing revealed delayed-type sensitizations to hydroxychloroquine (tested in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 2%).	3.0595510727827357
Equivalent tests in five healthy volunteers were negative.	3.393351728268389
The patch test reactions were pustular, while a biopsy was interpreted as a multiform contact dermatitis reaction.	3.1755081242448977
Bronchial exposure with hydroxychloroquine dust produced a delayed bronchial obstruction over the next 20 hours, which progressed to fever and generalized erythema (hematogenous contact dermatitis).	3.0260404550118447
After removing exposure to 2,6-diaminopyridine and hydroxychloroquine, the patient went on to develop a contact dermatitis to latex (patch test positive).	3.409082061688502
However, skin prick tests with latex and patch tests with rubber additiva were negative.	2.8830686306960103
Hydroxychloroquine is well known to cause drug reactions.	4.337111770577491
To our knowledge, contact dermatitis to this substance has not yet been reported.	2.9804140800169328
It is noteworthy that the patch test reactions were pustular and of multiform morphology and that bronchial exposure to the allergen resulted in asthma and a generalized drug reaction.	2.7128062161136826
Pathogenetically the asthmatic reaction seems to be on a delayed-type mechanism as is also seen with ampicillin, cobalt and nickel induced asthma.	3.345303915783958
A 45 years old female runner developed a bilateral tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon after repeated antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin.	3.1430251471002943
One month later the right Achilles tendon ruptured without any sudden pain.	3.1089396952555735
MRI revealed degenerative changes of the left Achilles tendon; on the right side the tendon was ruptured with a dehiscence of 4 cm between both ends of the tendon.	3.9446629639322115
The tendon was reconstructed surgically.	3.4462537832131215
The histological analysis showed cystic changes with focal necrosis.	3.1710162805199666
This finding differ from findings in non drug induced tendinopathies.	3.0374694878887407
After antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin the side effect of a tendon disorder must be considered.	3.4229434142396067
The impairment of the tendon may be as strong that a tendon rupture may occur at daily living activities without any typical clinical symptoms.	3.6532843584382033
The recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors.	3.7764409927472973
Several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer.	4.5287972791877635
In many cases, the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes is the predominant reason for cancerogenic cell transformation.	3.121389510396312
Functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations, resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the DNA.	4.180943590037648
As our understanding of the nature, function, and interaction of these genes evolves, new opportunities for early diagnosis, classification, prevention, and treatment of malignant tumors will arise.	3.998714338026751
The present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes (erbB, ras, myc, raf, fos, jun, bcl, mdm 2, myb, kit CSF1R, met) and tumor suppressor genes (p 53, rb, mts) involved in lung-cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors, including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned.	3.223600034511073
Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy is a kind of medical treatment in which a patient breathes 100% of oxygen inside a pressure chamber while the pressure of the chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure.	3.6190017016445006
It is strongly based on clearly defined physical laws and physiological regularities.	2.8895149709666
Among potential adverse effects, barotrauma of the lungs and especially oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system have to be mentioned.	4.097250751214829
Clinical use of HBO therefore requires special knowledge of its effects, risks, and adverse effects, a clear and distinct indication, and the ability and skills to keep complications under control by means of intensive care or emergency medical measures.	3.9387886734680424
The clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen with its interdisciplinary-like character of emergency medicine or intensive care therapy therefore should be an additional, most interesting field of activity for the anaesthesiologist.	3.3420088081795853
Although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established, there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment.	3.8249615325538
In order to sytematically analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures, we assessed 196 consecutive ankle fractures immediately before ORIF.	2.953484200836125
There were 94 male and 101 female patients with an average age of 47.8 years (16-88 years).	3.3688131733398765
There were more cartilage lesions found than expected, and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type C-fractures than in type B-fractures.	3.5764746732933856
In both fracture types, an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group 1 to 3.	3.6741040847547732
In addition, more ligament injuries were found than expected, especially in the B.1- and B.2-fractures.	3.4769066257078824
Successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in 26 cases: internal fixation, 9; loose body removal, 7; ligament reposition, 5; cartilage smoothening, 4; and cartilage fracture repair, 1.	3.4372451018310524
In one case, a periostal flap could not be reduced, and in another case, the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable.	3.857185791185022
In summary, arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures.	3.6157353590135752
As long-term results are not yet available, it remains, however, unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following ORIF.	4.994956914298505
Arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures.	3.5723997602750233
Of these, percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication.	3.6707466600099465
Objective: Transcultural adaption of the two most widely used and accepted functional indices in ankylosing spondylitis, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Dougados Functional Index (D-FI).	2.954060419990329
Methods: The instruments were translated and tested for internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC), construct validity (testing for association with Schober's test, finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, frequency and duration of awakenings at night, and a visual analog scale pain), and responsiveness (standardized response mean, SRM).	2.8529808116736852
Results: The study sample consisted of 72 patients of a randomized, controlled clinical trial receiving either Diclofenac or placebo.	3.388102489825486
Visual assessment of distribution patterns revealed a ceiling effect of both instruments.	3.099839228345309
Both questionnaires had a high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha: 0.81 [BASFI], 0.85 [D-FI] and a high test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.92 [BASFI], 0.89 [D-FI]).	2.845760098088984
The limited responsiveness to Diclofenac treatment (SRM: 0.46 [BASFI],  0.33 [D-FI]) may be related to the selected study sample.	3.1626324904460352
The BASFI was significantly correlated with all tested validation parameters.	3.3438265812240577
The  D-FI was only significantly correlated with finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, and duration of awakenings at night.	2.804435422671782
Conclusion: The transculturally adapted version of both functional indices are valid, reliable, and internally consistent.	2.8700992892980786
Because of psychometric advantages, the BASFI may be preferred in clinical trial settings.	3.2865704606880315
The role of radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in patients with node positive prostate cancer remains uncertain.	3.712936067621717
Interpretation of the few prospective studies (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06) is hampered by severe flaws in the study design.	3.290740909316727
Extension of the radiation to the paraaortal region shows no advantage over radiation of the pelvic lymphatics alone and is not warranted.	3.4713771093421855
Data on longterm side-effects are only available from older studies with outdated radiation techniques.	3.245085653166305
According to more recent studies short term side effects are considerably higher with radiation of the pelvic lymphatics when compared with radiation of the prostate alone.	3.5657626859032576
In summary radiation of the lymphatic pathways in lymph node positive prostate cancer cannot currently be considered as standard treatment and should be carried out within clinical studies.	3.912349646025291
In reconstruction of cartilage defects, autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method.	3.6429403414834285
Although a clinical application has not been reported until now, tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants.	3.472677789635066
Nevertheless, in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms.	3.2103450405801266
Among other methods for in vivo tissue protection, the encapsulation with a semipermeable polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences.	2.970884223031756
Human septal cartilage was encapsulated (group 1) with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of thymusaplastic nude mice.	3.212690093092385
Cartilage implants without encapsulation (group 2) were used as control.	3.929713674895673
Scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after implantation.	3.7059443587671272
Group 1 showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all.	3.416924807019728
In contrast, group 2 presented, correlating to the time of implanta-tion, increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation, representing an increased activity of resorption.	3.3556949037756945
In conclusion, tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences.	2.794066830160557
For the plastic-reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable.	3.0461785973374638
Subjective time-experience and objective time-estimation were examined in 20 endogenous, 20 neurotic depressives, and 15 healthy volunteers.	3.4823221847209616
Subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls.	2.8901453099704875
Objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives.	2.921413338703155
There were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives.	2.626750309105633
The perception of extended time normalized during treatment.	3.307576954605999
The depressives' time perception, differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and - to a lesser degree - with retardation.	3.4874948239421713
The findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives.	2.8414745349352812
Amelioration of experienced time-extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of Lewinsohn.	2.9735674474901006
We investigated whether the free-to-total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ratio (f-PSA/t-PSA ratio; i. e. percentage of free PSA) represents a better discriminator for the detection of cancer of the prostate (CaP).	3.494258878365477
In a retrospective analysis, the persentage of free PSA was determined in the sera of 35 patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 35 patients with clinically localized CaP.	3.284316957852884
Patients with urolithiasis (n = 33) served as a control group.	3.215567402020387
Serum levels of free PSA and total PSA were determined employing a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay.	3.316242301492291
Patients with CaP demonstrated a lower percentage of free PSA (median: 8.7) than patients with BPH (median: 20.0; P < 0.001) and those with urolithiasis (median: 18.8; P < 0.001).	3.1482907771635587
Determination of the percentage of free PSA enhances the differentiation between BPH and CaP and may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with an elevated PSA.	4.2184521165824025
Confirmation of our preliminary results is required.	3.431336321367213
Psychological problems in children and parents related to children's atopic eczema (AE) may impede the success of treatment.	3.503040198799016
We studied the question, if behavior-based parental education in groups (DPE) or standardized video-education (VPE) could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin-damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers.	3.029581537567668
Sevoflurane degrades in CO2 absorbents to produce compound A, which may have  hepatotoxic potential in humans.	3.500840888814347
Several recent studies in human volunteers have been performed to evaluate this potential.	4.039368785913721
Three studies have evaluated sevoflurane administered to volunteers using a 3% concentration for 8 h duration at approximately 2 L/min flow rate.	3.0163155106189974
The initial investigation found high excretion of protein, glucose and renal tubular enzymes in the urine of the volunteers receiving sevoflurane.	2.9899408405793366
Subsequent investigations using identical protocols found more minor or absent changes in excretion of these markers.	3.0030728465846623
One additional investigation in volunteers studied 3% sevoflurane anesthesia for 4 h duration using a low-flow (1 L/min) technique.	3.953355217692374
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was observed.	2.7373476203290625
Application of these results to clinical practice must be interpreted in light of the experimental nature of the anesthetic administration.	3.9691919361167405
Although some controversy remains, these data, combined with results of recent studies in surgical patients, suggest that renal function following modest duration low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia is similar to that following isoflurane anesthesia.	3.7280023140677736
Background: The microbial colonization of the intestinal tract in newborns begins during delivery.	2.8988919421092794
Streptococci and Escherichia coli pave the way for the bifidobacterial dominance typical in breast-fed newborns.	2.942570065563179
They provide optimal living conditions for anaerobic bifidobacteria by withdrawal of intraluminal oxygen.	2.9249576933515176
A mixed intestinal flora is established on infant formula feeding in the infant.	3.0469804012900497
Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and lactobacilli are the main genera of this mixed intestinal flora.	3.1049635428357654
This represents an intermediate stage of the microflora in adults.	3.463818824829962
The bifidogenic effect of mothers' milk is based on the active substances it contains, which selectively enhance the growth of bifidobacteria, whereas other active substances suppress the growth of the accompanying flora.	3.53413938652511
Bifidus-enhancing factors in breast-feeding are lactose, oligosaccharides, glycoproteins such as glycomacropeptide and the inoculation with bifidobacteria deriving from the skin surface of the mother.	3.2733912195780874
Factors directed to the suppression of the accompanying microflora are antibodies, lactoferrin, lysozyme, fatty acids and monoglycerides that act as antimicrobial substances and the comparatively low protein and iron content in mothers' milk.	2.8732961398747405
A bifidus-inhibiting colonization of the intestinal tract with pathogenic germs is caused by maternal birth-canal infections, which are now known to be the most frequent reason for premature births.	3.721825705892744
An increasing number of surgical deliveries, the separation of the newborn infant from its mother, and the generous use of antibiotics contribute to the delayed colonization of bifidobacteria and to the development of life-threatening nosocomial infections.	4.482636339169621
Counteractive measures against this disastrous situation are the preferential use of bifidobacteria-preserving antibiotics and the inoculation of lyophilized bifidobacteria.	3.061048588312966
Between January 1983 and December 1987, metatarsal head-resections were performed on 203 patients, comprising a total of 370 feet, using the Hueter/Mayo and Hoffmann procedure.	3.071717802557647
Seventy-two patients, comprising a total of 126 feet, were available for post-operative review after an average of 11.4 years from the date of the original operations.	3.9246502476957885
The information obtained from standardized questionnaires was compared to the information found in each patient's file.	3.8396885675551906
In addition, every available pre- and post-operative x-ray taken from 1983 to 1987 was analyzed.	2.9723381276978387
Thus, with an average follow-up period of 5.6 years, the changes found in the pre- and post-operative x-rays from a total of 183 feet could be compared.	3.960435509574666
Before the operations, nearly 100% of the examined feet suffered from painful synovial hypertrophy and erosion of the metatarsophalangeal joints with dislocation and subluxation, causing approximately 70% of all patients to have great difficulties in walking.	3.11333985799259
After the operations, however, 90.2% of the patients reported that this condition had noticeably improved or had completely disappeared.	4.092175148623921
In fact, 87.5% of all patients reported a lasting improvement in their ability to walk longer distances.	3.3019587882758397
As the main criteria in determining the success of an operation (namely, the noticeable reduction of pain and increased mobility) were achieved in 87.5% of the patients, we consider the metatarsal head-resection a reliable method of correcting forefoot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis.	3.9325049976577793
Bone metabolism is influenced by systemic and local acting hormons.	3.6259903897297745
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) as representatives of the latter substances are known to have the ability for ectopic bone formation.	3.570441629529796
Within this study, we investigated the influence of different growth factors on the proliferation- and differentiation rate of osteoblast-like cells.	3.5600409912261473
For that purpose, human osteoblast-like cells (HPOC) were incubated in the presence of either recombinant BMP-4 of the genome of xenopus laevis (rxBMP-4), recombinant human BMP 2 (rhBMP-2), transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) or basic fibroblast growth factor (rh-bFGF) in two different concentrations each (10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml).	3.0733134797218655
Cell proliferation was measured within a MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromid] assay, the amount of cell differentiation by the activity of alcaline phosphatase.	4.2007063889256155
Rx-BMP-4 induced a differentiation of HPOC to almost the same extent as rhBMP-2, whereas the addition of rh-bFGF, applied at the same concentration, failed to have any influence on cell differentiation.	3.584785936002801
However, rh-bFGF provoked an increase in cell proliferation when compared with unstimulated HPOC, while rhBMP-2 and rxBMP-4 showed no effect on proliferation.	3.3665211128792523
TGF-ß influenced bone proliferation as well as differenciation significantly.	4.02100430621516
The equipotent effect of recombinant human BMP-2 and recombinant BMP-4 obtained from Xenopus laevis with regard to differentiation and proliferation of human primary osteoblast-like cells originates either in the fact that target cells have receptors for BMP 2 as well as BMP 4, or that both BMP's link to the same receptor with almost the same affinity.	3.472720880902137
Sonography has provided an important addition to the tools available for the diagnosis of the soft tissues in the head and neck region.	3.981678414850995
The ENT surgeon himself is able to examine pathological formations by this quick, non-invasive and, last but not least, less expensive method.	3.320917016992203
Due to the high resolution of the procedure the chance of detecting even small changes is increased and the exactness of diagnosis of pathological lymph nodes of the neck has been significantly improved compared to palpation alone.	3.3812891504114866
Ultrasound has replaced the sialographic procedures in the field of diagnostic evaluation of salivary gland disease in the daily practice except for special indications.	3.9679437251844787
After inauguration of color Doppler sonography non-invasive evaluation of vascular stenosis of the large cervical vessels concerning their hemodynamic effects has become possible.	3.382397221878324
This issue is important for the differential dignosis of otoneurological diseases such as sudden hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus.	3.295678946585802
Additionally, the extent of perfusion of space-occupying lesions can be easily examined, and therefore the risk of mass bleeding can be preoperatively assessed by this method without harm to the patient.	3.7544269543329225
Especially carotid body tumors may be diagnosed with high accuracy by the evidence of significant diffuse perfusion of the lesion.	3.466259947725375
However, other authors have shown inconsistent results in differentiation of benign and malignant lumps; therefore, final judgment does not seem to be possible yet.	3.2675239409030077
Use of echo-contrast agents to enhance the ultrasound signal seems to be a promising approach for future developments in color Doppler imaging.	3.2505086983597886
Painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill-defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat.	3.9932654556474163
The nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder, adhesive capsulitis, focal algodystrophy, stiff shoulder, contracted shoulder, and others.	2.7218481262344842
Apart from its idiopathic form, the disease can be initiated by trauma, infection, tumour, radiation, systemic and local metabolic disturbances.	3.6118183288315384
Pathoanatomically, the common denominator is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening, scarring, and retraction of the joint capsule.	3.1065263586922223
The inflammatory process often starts at the rotator interval and may extend to the subacromial space.	3.059663844701461
The prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not treated is unfavorable, with a reported 5-year survival of 0-18 %.	3.8019538288582777
Before the era of immunotherapy and in the absence of effective nonsurgical therapy, resection of metastases was the accepted way to prolong survival, giving a 5-year survival of 7-69 %.	3.627882315416283
Retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis.	3.809826920619522
Some patients will benefit from resection of metastases, but most patients with metastatic RCC are not candidates for such aggressive surgery.	3.4672922000096253
The use of interleukin-2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions.	2.978180017997378
Without randomized trials, it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients, but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long-lasting remissions in selected patients.	3.885212924121361
Many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit-to-risk ratio of immunotherapy, but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic RCC.	4.3883923333651715
After loss of active glenohumeral motion the arm cannot be positioned in space and function is impaired.	3.138818397736075
Fusion of the glenohumeral joint creates a new platform for the movement of elbow, hand and fingers and leads to an improvement of function.	3.441850701748946
The use of the reconstructive plate makes the operation easier.	3.050447412253172
But fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered.	3.1189056446909893
The unreamed femoral nail (UFN) system, with its numerous proximal interlocking options, allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns.	3.6877041666864576
Sixty-six fractures, 5 cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures, 2 limb shortenings and 1 lengthening (monorail technique) and 3 cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the UFN from July 1994 to December 1996.	2.9281847452150815
The fractures were analysed according to the AO classification.	3.5156199296700956
We found 31 polytrauma patients with an mean ISS of 21.8 and a mean PTS of 25.4.	3.517986535716928
Most of the multiply injured patients (n = 26) were stabilised with the UFN primarily.	3.2943144418009846
Follow-up of 44 patients ranged from 4 to 18 months postoperatively.	3.383260004379338
According to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in 34 % of cases, good in 36.3 %, poor in 20.4 % and bad in 9 %.	3.968800886343868
Average fracture healing time was about 9.8 weeks.	3.405252224475057
Fractures of the atlas account for 1-2 % of all vertebral fractures.	3.6759431434756586
We divide atlas fractures into 5 groups: isolated fractures of the anterior arch of the atlas, isolated fractures of the posterior arch, combined fractures of the anterior and posterior arch (so-called Jefferson fractures), isolated fractures of the lateral mass and fractures of the transverse process.	4.080448054620896
Isolated fractures of the anterior or posterior arch are benign and are treated conservatively with a soft collar until the neck pain has disappeared.	3.5532950913466306
Jefferson fractures are divided into stable and unstable fracture depending on the integrity of the transverse ligament.	3.8294294737955012
Stable Jefferson fractures are treated conservatively with good outcome while unstable Jefferson fractures are probably best treated operatively with a posterior atlanto-axial or occipito-axial stabilization and fusion.	3.180916955201716
The authors preferred treatment modality is the immediate open reduction of the dislocated lateral masses combined with a stabilization in the reduced position using a transarticular screw fixation C1/C2 according to Magerl.	3.2245210911746574
This has the advantage of saving the atlanto-occipital joints and offering an immediate stability which makes immobilization in an halo or Minerva cast superfluous.	2.8626215846269565
Isolated fractures of the lateral masses are very rare and may, if the lateral mass is totally destroyed, be a reason for an occipito-cervical fusion.	3.5886703870942473
Fractures of the transverse processes may be the cause for a thrombosis of the vertebral artery.	4.310091617377857
No treatment is necessary for the fracture itself.	4.085264789204755
Reported is the case of a 36-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery.	3.7463815208545532
Histologically and immunohistochemically, no hints on angiodysplasia as a possible cause of bleeding were detected.	3.2722473370226552
Considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture, a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the neighbouring neurofibromatous proliferates was most probably the reason for bleeding.	4.59175456334245
We report on a 2-year-old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC).	2.9098408996267233
Concomitantly with a feverish gastrointestinal infection caused by Salmonella enteritidis, the child presented with lesions resembling impetigo contagiosa on the legs and face.	2.87684794141428
Following antibiotic treatment with cephalosporins p.o.	3.157614841152405
she developed typical symptoms of CBDC, i.e.	3.245285479239674
tense blisters on erythematous skin in the perineal area, on the flexor aspects of the thighs and upper arms and on the face.	3.857806129563084
Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone, confirming the diagnosis of CBDC.	3.234793740236512
These lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p.o.	3.3386553252340647
This case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis, clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood.	4.0478719511953285
Systemic administration of strontium-89 is an important option for pain relief in advanced prostate carcinoma with multiple osseous metastases.	3.6067586295062
Recently, rhenium-186-HEDP was introduced as a new substance which has important advantages (shorter physical half-life, scintigraphic imaging, dose distribution).	3.0282424930487144
The myelosuppressive effect can be estimated more accurately in advance, so that adverse effects can be reduced and the treatment can be repeated after a shorter period of time and more often.	4.14025843027658
Our study comprises 15 treatments with rhenium-186-HEDP in advanced prostate cancer patients using the 1.4- to 2-fold standard dose.	2.983371559203574
The mean duration of pain relief was 4-6 weeks.	4.022584251242847
All four patients with repeated therapy were also responding to the second treatment.	3.2708883295377618
Radionuclide therapy for painful osseous metastases with rhenium-186-HEDP appears to be an effective and, even at higher doses, safe procedure.	3.3419894409320268
Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat renal and central nervous system manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).	3.336302989296642
It is employed especially to prevent renal failure in lupus nephritis.	3.1987538848441255
Within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the standard therapy in severe SLE due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to oral application.	3.751879177444671
Studies on the slightly more cost-effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published, however, there are no data on long-term results yet.	3.6757809099813588
Here, we review the effects and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in SLE.	3.8679803210176193
Because of the possible side effects, especially the high risk of malignancies, which sharply increases at a cumulative dose of approximately 60g, cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously.	3.8567562870209073
Cyclophosphamide bolus therapy should only be performed in hospitals with special experience.	4.0444071209712975
The optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed.	3.7680113547844445
Most authors prefer delayed surgery.	3.35010292528527
The definition of the term "acute" varies between 48 hours and 4 weeks.	3.1593918176773683
In this study the limit was set at 60 hours.	2.791906341454532
Acute ACL reconstruction was performed in 39 patients and delayed surgery in 35 after they had regained full ROM.	3.904958782249988
The incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44% lower in this population.	3.1449164780817735
When the indication is clear, we think that acute ACL reconstruction may be performed within 60 hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis.	3.5217414257436417
Nowadays, this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons.	3.7356056526423336
After some introductory remarks on the influence of psychosocial risk factors on the developmental outcome of premature infants this review summarizes the current knowledge about intervention programs for prematures and their parents with a special focus on parent-centered programs.	3.4198237610589866
Only parent-centered interventions enhanced the quality of parent-infant interaction.	3.325304885572095
It is questioned if those effects are also reliable for very premature infants and are found in the long term.	3.5537143629473955
Further programs should focus on parent- and parent-infant centered interventions.	3.090312778414668
Methodological problems of intervention studies and further research perspectives on parent-centered interventions are discussed.	3.1094447064185364
The surgical therapy of the rupture of a distal biceps tendon and a modified postoperative treatment is described.	3.7075659021736502
Mainpoint is the early treatment in anaclisis of Kleinert as it is standardized in the treatment of ruptures of the flexor tendons of the hand.	3.7944972196403297
A forearm orthesis with a simply ROM-joint without reboundmechanism was used.	2.922207995510451
Possible benefits are shown and further industrial evolution seems to be indicated.	3.704105798337995
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP) are involved in important processes of tumor invasion and metastasis.	3.2004752614040597
In the study presented, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and 3 (MMP3), the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were measured by ELISA tests specific for these proteins in blood plasma.	3.2931193334803197
These components have been investigated in prostate cancer patients (PCa) with metastases (n = 18; T2, 3, 4 pN1, 2M1), prostate cancer patients without metastases (n = 29; T2, 3 pN0M0), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; n = 29) and in healthy men (n = 35).	3.562560262698903
Mean values of MMP1 and of the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were not different among the four groups.	3.490677104728271
The mean values of MMP3 and especially TIMP1 were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with controls, BPH patients and prostate cancer patients without metastases.	3.1965258535767944
Ten of these 18 patients had TIMP1 levels higher than the upper reference limit.	3.483558142642178
TIMP1 concentrations correlate to the tumor stage but not to the tumor grade.	4.132979987305252
These results indicate, that TIMP1 could be an potential marker for metastases in prostate cancer patients.	2.995925602715581
The interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach.	3.307726503793268
As in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device (ASDOS) is affected by late complications, particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations.	2.9991100207527857
The demonstration of 4 case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an ASDOS device.	3.4438700286016894
The diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation.	3.7011940287434
For early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after ASDOS implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about postinventional problems of this device is essential.	3.7166643311840524
Every ASDOS patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography.	3.162727903296917
The emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately.	3.0417322225402343
Furthermore, the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications.	3.185728154092185
The goal of cardiocerebral resuscitation is to return to the pre-arrest level of neurological function and to reintegrate the patient into his former social circumstances.	3.0042823343549707
This study evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in a country-area.	4.138049198473425
The economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant.	3.626774693041608
Approximately 1 to 2% of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure.	3.6095278593642055
A great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long-term complications and productivity losses.	3.8567452804541213
In order to manage these costs, providers and policymakers increasingly have to focus on economicaly attractive interventions.	2.692575957806138
Teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work-up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics.	4.377690503917302
Due to more complex therapeutic strategies and legally defined formal requirements, the need for teleconsultation will increase significantly in the future.	3.5163999632302634
Rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation (based upon an ISDN network in the beginning, later on by the use of a national health network).	3.2565762434698287
The medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery.	3.339873385896178
However, the question of adequate financial compensation for this type of medical service is still unclear.	3.437101480466007
All 459 surgeons and orthopedists in private practice in Berlin (approx.	3.1596144520543223
3.5 Million inhabitants) were contacted in March 1997 and asked to cooperate.	3.2237764122256465
An 18-point questionnaire was sent out to record the physician's experience with atraumatic and posttraumatic neck complaints, which was returned by only 112 (25%).	3.5672172591819455
According to their assessment these physicians treated ca.	2.954694167835878
7800 with a history of a preceeding trauma over a 12-month-period (1996).	3.7340651309436055
All responders had treated patients with posttraumatic complaints; about 60% stated having treated between 20 and 60 patients per year, 25% a smaller and 15% a greater number of patients.	3.316395962995166
The average treatment time was stated to be 2-5 weeks by 60% of the physicians, 10% listed a peak of 6-7 weeks and another 10% in excess of this peak.	3.7967251705104297
Half of the physicians stated having also treated patients with a cervical trauma not caused by another person (a total of 500 cases).	4.415825265649847
Symptoms/findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca.	3.1991501668470725
50% of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half.	4.247486751707165
It is noteworthy that the physician's point of view was influenced by personal accident experience (accident as a car passenger): 54% of the 26 physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be traumaspecific compared to only 35% of 40 physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms.	2.7939679048191715
The statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22% of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62% of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement.	3.577182793851411
The "subject physician" in the context of "whiplash injury" is not yet sufficiently investigated but seems to be an interesting topic of further research.	3.988285361295213
To measure dilation of large retinal branch vessels.	3.133914649184671
The paper reminds of the many psychiatrists, neurologists, and pathologists connected with scientific work in neuropathology who were expelled from Germany between 1933 and 1939 because of defamation by the Nuremberg Laws or because of their political opposition.	2.7117342710950094
Many of these colleagues saw their only way out as suicide.	2.913265535961271
Short biographies give an orientation about the destiny of the expelled physicians in their host countries.	3.04039486849917
The effort made after 1945 to give these emigrated colleagues again an adaequate position in Germany have not been very intensive.	3.1047497105329445
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a diagnostic tool for special indications in oral and maxillofacial surgery.	3.2114490211130415
We describe a new MRI technique that presents images in a panoramic view analogous to orthopantomography.	2.7572970779541266
This technique is based on three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted sequences.	3.775441543913402
The familiar panoramic view in MRI provides better orientation and makes diagnosis faster and easier.	2.967908416943443
However, the acquisition time is long (6-12 min per sequence), with a correspondingly high risk of motion artifacts.	3.7808398435708903
Moreover, the final workup is also time-consuming.	3.0005882807124142
These restrictions could be overcome by progress in hardware and software.	3.049920507553606
There are promising indications for dental MRI.	3.054177740569176
During recent years home ventilation has been shown to be useful for a growing number of patients with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency caused by weakness of the respiratory muscles.	3.965280286229334
Despite its technical simplicity, home ventilation leads to a number of social, ethical, medical and infrastructural problems.	3.6494079669585977
This consensus paper discusses the special situation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in home ventilation and describes the current thinking in the following topics: (1) definition of home ventilation; (2) aims of home ventilation; (3) indications and preconditions of home ventilation; (4) techniques and forms of home ventilatory support; (5) preparation for and practical questions of home ventilation; (6) stopping home ventilation.	3.9924798296301955
Pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by a massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction.	3.693101868253495
It is rarely after hip surgery, however, untreated it may be complicated by a life threatening perforation of the colon.	3.8209241154575135
In a retrospective analysis we reviewed 11 patients (4 women, 7 men, mean age 75.2 years, range 67 to 86 years) with pseudo-obstruction of the colon after hip surgery in the years 1995 to 1998.	3.498309898567618
In relation to all patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery of the hip, the prevalence was 1.06%.	4.3199833135838706
The leading clinical symptom was abdominal distension.	3.241972850564847
On plain x-rays, dilatation of the colon measured 13.3 cm on average (9-16 cm).	3.867016933627681
In two patients (18%) adaequate application of drugs stimulating the gastro-intestinal motility was sufficient, whereas in 8 patients (73%) colonoscopic decompression had to be performed.	3.2563558776118513
In three of these, the procedure failed and because of persistent symtoms a coecostomy was performed.	3.8331631816378358
One patient underwent immediate laparotomy because of peritonitis.	3.077850276467909
2 patients (18%) died because of a complicated course.	3.986304299210205
Non operative treatment should not exceed 24 hours, endoscopic decompression and tube placement is considered as the treatment of choice.	3.7048787329976087
In cases of failure of these procedures, perforation of the colon and/or peritonism, urgent laparotomy with open decompression by a coecostomy is essential.	3.5407071901409193
Anti-semitism increased from year to year in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.	2.7634126301083897
The fear of annihilation resulted in a surge of suicides.	3.3826442460813775
Their mean age was 65 years.	3.8972678672016148
Couples often committed suicide together.	3.4688398888623975
At the end of World War II, the head of the dermatological department of the Prague University committed suicide.	3.108380134282764
We assume the same happened in Rostock and Dresden.	2.9448142246844893
The motives of these dermatologists were obviously the collapse of Nazism and the fear of relatiatory measures.	2.8019139913657995
Since 1992 the author has been using this material as a bone graft substitute in maxillofacial surgery.	3.014331555934061
Seventy-seven clinical implantations were done for different indications.	3.2782422808806215
The results suggest that coral grafts are well tolerated and become partially ossified when the calcified skeleton is resorbed.	2.8993786053686357
This material has been demonstrated to be successful.	3.7938773761035045
Aim: An overview on the evidence-based indications for an immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases is given.	3.3890760287769846
Background: The aim of the study was the evaluation of how ophthalmological diagnoses and the proportion of multiply handicapped children has changed within the last 20 years at a state school for visually handicapped and blind children.	3.0727719492436507
Introduction: Visual impairment as the initial symptom of leukemia is rare.	3.1900108493111152
Although retinal involvement during leukemia is frequent, a leukemic macular lesion is an exception.	3.043676220323001
Introduction: It was our aim to evaluate the results of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) with regard to recurrent hernias treated in our department.	3.992839635444547
Methods: Included were 276 operations for first or subsequent recurrence of inguinal hernia previously treated with suture repair.	2.964567888195689
All final repairs were carried out using the TAPP technique.	3.2509132906817024
The data were collected prospectively.	3.441735255848613
The patients were examined 2 weeks and 1 year postoperatively.	3.7531328329025975
The rate of follow-up amounted to 78.1 % at 1 year after operation.	3.2449345727558083
Results: Perioperative complications were monitored prospectively and divided into intraoperative, minor and major.	3.1258281910386287
The re-recurrence rate was 0.4 %.	3.6594673210313915
Conclusions: Because of the general advantages of laparoscopic surgery and the low recurrence rate we prefer laparoscopic hernioplasty using the TAPP technique.	3.5242004951483223
Diseases of the hindfoot are associated with considerable functional impairment and therefore may hamper patients' movements during gait considerably.	3.5236501044964843
Because of biomechanical overload, articular structures, tendons and ligaments are prone to early degenerative changes during the course of rheumatic diseases as visible with plain film radiography, sonography (US), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	3.0566089685811133
Findings may occur as arthritis of major joints or in the form of fibroostitis and bursitis of the os calcis.	3.9406053497905247
Despite the progressive course of rheumatic diseases and characteristic imaging findings, high variability of X-ray signs may occur.	3.4437572571965354
Plain film radiograms and high-resolution ultrasonography play a key role in imaging rheumatic diseases of the hindfoot.	3.718572090528136
MRI supports imaging diagnosis in selected cases.	3.1468796239360954
The principal goals of diagnostic imaging are precise and reproducible documentation of morphologic abnormalities and differentiated analysis for planning proper conservative or surgical treatment.	2.864949240284691
Background: We evaluated the prevalence of the loss of visual acuity due to loss of the central portion of the visual field and foveolar fixation in the first week after glaucoma filtering surgery.	3.9711133902764884
The aim of the present study was to test polylactic acid material as a controlled release carrier for polypeptide growth factors.	2.627641326891695
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was incorporated into DL polylactic acid (PLA) pellets under hyperbaric CO2 pressure in two different ways.	2.913596689898251
(1) Lyophilized bFGF was crushed and mixed with PLA granules, filled into cylindric moulds of 5 x 3 mm, and submitted to hyperbaric CO2 pressure.	2.7885722915875264
(2) Lyophilized bFGF was reconstituted in phosphate buffer, mixed with PLA granules, and relyophilized.	2.6705122310500498
In vitro assessment of bFGF release from the PLA implants by immunoassay showed that loading of PLA with crushed lyophilized bFGF resulted in a rapid and high release, while loading by solubilized bFGF and relyophilization led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor.	3.0066113753075885
Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children.	3.3177688718945215
In recent years this abnormality has also been observed in adults with chronic constipation.	3.3624888208698733
The aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease.	2.4740598520342445
The investigation was performed with 10 adults with IND, compared with 10 healthy control probands.	3.330094866499764
The best diagnostic indicator of IND proved to be the detection of 6-10 giant ganglia with more than 7 nerve cells in 15 biopsy sections.	3.8670734772285984
IND is an interesting cause of chronic constipation which can be histologically verified.	4.145820135223187
Extracorporal shock-wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in the kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	2.655751295068749
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of soft-tissue disorders and tendinosis calcarea.	2.6895265676518463
To date, the exact mechanism is unknown.	2.897791280917412
Local hyperemia following damage or afferent inhibition is discussed.	2.9370467302305006
The possibilities and indications of ESWA with respect to several syndroms are presented.	3.4050766271152173
The results show the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of chronic soft-tissue disorders without severe side effects.	2.835811993957253
Some patients showed small subcutaneous hematomas and erosion of the skin when energies about 20 mJ were used.	3.24299994822934
Forty-seven of 84 of the patients obtained complete relief; 24 patients showed a marked reduction in their complaints.	4.2681572059384285
In only 13 of 84 cases was the treatment unsuccessful.	3.1542910344653325
Up to now there are no facts concerning the loosening rate of the cemented titanium stem (Trios).	2.900455214282033
The central guiding canula and the longitudinal drilled stem shall ensure a symmetric cement mantle.	2.7680453048730325
Management of laryngeal carcinoma located at the anterior commissure remains controversial.	3.389042383391295
Local control rates with radiotherapy or surgery are not as good as those seen after treatment of midcord lesions.	3.203795006073384
The vertical partial laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction (VPLER) may be a more successful approach to such lesions.	3.561387043737637
The charts of all patients treated for larynx carcinoma between 1991 and 1996 at the authors' institutions were reviewed to identify those patients treated with VPLER as described by Sedlacek in 1965, Kambic in 1976 and Tucker in 1979.	3.5252658879778225
Indications for performing surgery and outcome data of patients were collected and analyzed according to the indications for surgery, surgical technique, perioperative complications, oncological outcomes and functional results.	3.7552817027844365
Twelve patients were identified that had been treated with VPLER.	4.267106399179774
Indications for surgery included five patients with local recurrences following endoscopic laser partial laryngectomies, four cases with previously untreated primary tumors at the anterior commissure (T2 N0-2 M0), two with local recurrences following radiotherapy, and one with recurrence following frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	3.246579087679419
There were no postoperative complications except for one laryngocutaneous fistula that required secondary repair.	2.8020923857725664
All patients were able to swallow at the tenth postoperative day.	2.94887099203311
All had their tracheostomies closed after completion of wound healing, (a mean of 17 days after surgery).	3.8083857770936476
Phonatory results were usually poor.	3.687988915916942
Two local recurrences occurred during the follow-up period.	3.4534421155469124
However, both patients were salvaged with total laryngectomies and have since been free from disease.	2.9914053248669634
All other patients are alive and well.	2.9468504166113485
Our findings show that VPLER is an effective surgical approach for carcinoma at the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately managed with transoral laser surgery or simple frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	3.0458819865871285
This study demonstrates that the procedure can be successfully applied to the treatment of local recurrences following initial raditherapy or surgery.	4.264952522705886
No major complications occurred in our study.	3.76412332525627
Traditionally, intra-vitam diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of brain supplying arteries is a domain of conventional selective angiography.	3.073697905860157
We are aware of only two publications reporting of ultrasound displayed intimal and medial variants of carotid artery FMD, in one case each.	2.878089036169754
We present a patient in whom color-coded duplex-sonography revealed a web-like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal FMD.	2.8292247327448217
The relationship between depression and the outcome of low back surgery was investigated.	3.9248756933269076
Data analysis was based on two assumptions: (1) Presurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and, therefore, depression can be interpreted as a risk factor for surgical failure.	3.7805751202777946
(2) Postsurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and therefore, depression can be interpreted as a response to treatment failure.	3.1858823236581784
The sample was made up of 78 patients who had undergone lumbar nucleotomy and 132 patients with lumbar spondylodesis.	3.200546561753817
Treatment outcome was evaluated 6 months after surgery in the nucleotomy group and 9 months after surgery in the spondylodesis group.	3.730027133960795
Depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	3.0357556203967633
Measures of treatment outcome were an objective rating system for the surgical result, functional impairment, return to work, subjective estimations of the patient, and pain intensity.	3.9426988532675953
Presurgical depression scores showed no significant relationship with surgical outcome in nucleotomy patients.	3.5886142091245095
In spondylodesis patients, however, there was a significant negative correlation with the patients' subjective outcome ratings.	4.857865323155147
Postsurgical depression scores, on the other hand, were significantly related to almost all of the outcome variables in both treatment groups.	4.115907992150232
Patients with clinically relevant postsurgical depression scores were significantly more likely not to benefit sufficiently from surgery than those with clinically not relevant depression scores.	3.133261149871955
Our findings favour assumption 2 over assumption.	2.9935541495705795
In the light of our findings, depressiveness is interpreted as a response to a non-beneficial outcome of surgery.	3.312653263231971
The need for an interdisciplinary approach combining psychological counseling or treatment and physical therapy for those patients who do not benefit from surgery is discussed.	3.4857798594318816
Using electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) with short exposure times of 100 or 50 ms and the capability of acquiring up to 2 x 17 images/s it is possible to study most of the important morphological and functional determinants of the heart.	3.4463443369452307
Various examples of studies in acute and chronic cardiac diseases are shown to demonstrate the use of EBCT to determine quantitatively left ventricular volumes (ml), myocardial mass (g), wall thickness changes over the cardiac cycle (mm/s), myocardial perfusion (ml/100 g/min) and the extent of coronary calcification (calcium score) and qualitatively the state of the proximal 4-6 cm of the subepicardial coronary arteries.	4.151921393798012
The knowledge of these determinants seems very useful in excluding cardiac dysfunction, in the early recognition of cardiac disease and in the evaluation of the haemodynamic severity of coronary artery stenotic lesions.	4.650261670719806
Further interdisciplinary studies are necessary to assess the clinical validity of these cardiac determinants, especially myocardial perfusion, using this advanced CT technology.	3.5548369447186556
Fractures and dislocations of the elbow are some of the most common injuries in childhood and adolescence.	4.57099994543813
The majority occur in sport and play activities, e. g., a fall from gymnastics apparatus or a bike, or from popular sports items, such as skateboards or in-line skates.	3.0866324968008256
The injuries can be divided into pure dislocations of the joint and fractures of the distal humerus, proximal radius and ulna, or combinations of both.	3.8904527742829424
In addition, extra- and intraarticular fracture types are defined, with the latter as partial or complete joint lesions.	3.51895924418862
Dislocations of the elbow joint or the radial head can occur as single injuries or in combination with a fracture.	4.1352154154593075
Supracondylar fractures and avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle are the most frequent extraarticular lesions of the distal humerus.	5.340453167466544
Fractures of the lateral condyle prevail is incomplete intraarticular lesions.	3.1136279431242757
In the forearm, radial head and neck fractures are predominant while typical and atypical Monteggia injuries have a special status.	3.4280648300492618
The complex joint construction and the age-dependent appearance of the epiphyseal ossification centers sometimes make a correct radiological diagnosis difficult.	3.4453621151702714
The trauma history and an exact, clinical examination help to verify the injury, as do comparative X-ray studies of the uninjured side when necessary (but not routinely).	3.485714556470302
Unlike other anatomical areas, most elbow injuries - even in the growing skeleton - are treated operatively.	3.310266493725748
Hereby, the growth plates have to be respected using minimal amounts of small implants.	3.7708572566883465
Additional immobilization in a cast for 2 - 4 weeks is necessary in most cases but does not lead to a functional deficit - in contrast to adults.	4.276057385485111
The implants should be removed as early as possible.	2.8020012445391553
Despite all therapeutic efforts, a significant number of late sequelae, such as malunions and functional impairment, can be seen.	4.214771194369963
The rate of long-term complications increases in cases of untreated displacement of fragments or joint instability.	3.590103657511028
Corrective measures are performed only in selected cases and after the growth plates are closed.	4.277546720239879
Our own treatment regime is demonstrated using exemplary clinical cases of the different injuries and the results of a long-term follow-up study on sports injuries of the elbow in children.	4.406755520351224
Errors in diagnosis and therapy, as well as possible complications, are pointed out.	4.2010347151719
2-adrenergic agonists, mimicking the action of the inhibitory transmitter norepinephrine, cause antinociception due to postsynaptic inhibition of spinothalamic projection neurons, presynaptic inhibition at the central nervous system termination of primary sensory nerves, presynaptic inhibition of brainstem noradrenergic neurons and a generalized decrease in central nervous system sympathetic efferent activity.	2.953836603925056
There is a mutual potentiation of antinociceptive effects of clonidine and morphine.	2.845273927106797
Clonidine is used in chronic pain states for treatment of neuropathic, neuralgic and deafferentiating pain.	4.07506874547981
Based on a meta-analysis of the studies published in the years 1996-1996, the therapeutic efficacy of systematically administered clonidine was evaluated in chronic pain states.	4.028692401874002
Out of 403 screened published studies, only 9 fulfilled the selection criteria.	3.0038559707226344
Besides three case reports with successful clonidine treatment, four placebo-controlled studies could be analyzed treating the following chronic pain states: chest pain despite normal coronary angiograms; painful diabetic neuropathy; postherpetic neuralgia; hyperalgia in patients with sympathetically maintained pain and chronic low back pain.	3.3906966897504063
Although three studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain scores, the improvement in pain relief in these cases was slight.	4.273703000442864
Long-term treatment was successful in a few responders over a period of 17 months.	3.7372563317751473
Hyperalgesia caused by sympathetically maintained pain was relieved by topical (transdermal) application of clonidine.	3.013247982436377
Based on this evaluation a grade C recommendation is derived, which relates to responders.	2.801244833515495
Successful treatment is expected only in pain states with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.	3.3714528812777576
Therefore, in chronic pain, treatment with systemic clonidine is of no significant value.	3.4751254206242814
Study objective: To investigate whether automatic tube compensation (ATC) or conventional pressure support (PS) is suit- able to compensate for the work of breathing imposed by the breathing circuit without altering the breathing pattern.	2.8831988060865
DNA-based prenatal testing of the fetal genotype was performed in a family at risk for recurrence of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).	3.2863483165450553
DNA from cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from the peripheral blood of the previously affected offspring, DNA from parental leukocytes and DNA from fetal tissue obtained by chorionic villus biopsy was analysed by direct PCR amplification of known polymorphic regions within or flanking the type VII collagen gene, the canditate gene in RDEB.	2.8261329512988507
One flanking marker (D3S2/MspI) as well as two intragenic polymorphisms (C7/MspI, C7/Eco0109I) in exons 30 and 84 were informative in this family.	2.956034030171396
This prediction was confirmed by the birth of a healthy female infant.	3.6400885433125074
The study reports successful determination of the fetal genotype by PCR-based prenatal diagnosis in a family at risk for recurrence of severe RDEB.	3.4196351461354633
Endothelins are peptides with powerful vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties.	2.982291549464445
It has become evident that endothelins are involved in many regulatory mechanisms of the circulation role both in short and in long term.	3.315049870296576
However, in many cases it remains unclear whether the alteration of the endothelin metabolism is a primary pathology or a secondary phenomenon.	3.3281447309311893
The synthesis of endothelin receptor antagonists and animal models with altered endothelin metabolism have opened a new era of endothelin research that will allow insight into the mechanisms of endothelin-action and eventually might lead to new therapeutic concepts.	2.943719457048171
This review discusses the evidence both in favor and against pathogenic effects of endothelins in cardiovascular disease.	2.8483520289012954
The combination of fast MR sequences and rapid i. v. injection of paramagnetic contrast media provides information on cerebral perfusion.	2.9515934184988737
MR-perfusion imaging primarily depicts the relative cerebral blood volume.	3.2139077731695336
The aim of this study was to test whether MR-perfusion imaging with a clinical MR scanner using a standard 2D-FLASH sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors.	2.9373234145416256
Brain infarctions, lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls.	3.096162646028771
However, our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method, which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow.	3.9645128015474076
Lumbar Microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach.	3.266946260292791
The microscope is the best surgical aid.	3.820061201913753
Alternatives are a retractorintigrated light or headlamp.	3.2951061590571933
A specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy - the wrong level - can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning.	3.320266413207941
Other complications like dural lesions and exessive bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view.	3.526191292099717
The most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation, major vessel or visceral injury, can be avoided by lusing the new rongeur with a depth guard.	3.1282166964555884
From January 1987 to March 1994 three hospitals in the city of Magdeburg treated a total of 103 subcutaneous Achilles tendon ruptures operatively.	3.154720381559257
We created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used.	4.632995485897755
Important aspects of the follow-up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a KIN-TREX dynamic measuring device and the clinical check-up in comparison with the histological results and the patients' history.	4.359947458670201
Degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38,8 % of the cases.	3.8446411410598174
The average score of all OP methods applied was 767 of possible 1000 points.	2.9085592722923974
The adaptation suture (781 points), Silfverskiold's technique (772 points) and the fibrin adhesive technique (754 points) showed approximately the same results.	3.328540549713494
Isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load.	3.4131717497201333
To determine wether a somatic dysfunction of head joints depends from segmental muscle strain, we investigated 89 patients before, during and after general anesthesia.	3.1641655673475855
We examined the disturbed joint motion as exclusive criterion for a somatic dysfunction, because through an anesthesia with endotracheal intubation including complete neuromuscular blockade segmental influences on the inspected joint were eleminated.	2.8472792749163633
For complete muscle relaxation as required for orotracheal intubation a non depolarizising muscle relaxant was used.	3.0775217221916544
Somatic dysfunctions were found most frequent for side-inclination and retroflexion in segment O/C1.	2.958719127458301
Both before as well as during complete neuromuscular blockade could be found in the majority of examinations (89,1 %) similar restraints of joint motions.	4.228280374294948
To 10,9 % were found, that somatic dysfunctions established before the muscle relaxant was applicated, were no more demonstrable under complete blockade of neuromuscular transmission.	3.1906505640548426
Different theoretical models are presented for the interpretation of our results.	4.088148422801907
We assume, that the disturbance of one component of the metamer organized segment is the basic phänomenon of somatic dysfunction.	3.3449258532521453
This disturbance break through the spinal segmental inhibition and expand into the segment.	3.0900782976670733
Subsequently we discuss to replace the term "somatic dysfunction" through "segmental dysfunction" and to define it as increasing of nozizeptive afference in the segment over a determined period of time with breakthrough of the spinal segmental inhibition threshold.	3.226857311082699
Postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra-abdominal operations.	3.8268175982766053
The postoperative delay of bowel movement, however, is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used.	3.7384769212689943
In order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic-induced postoperative delay of bowel movement, two types of intravenous-based anaesthesia using fentanyl/midazolam (1 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h), and ketamine/midazolam (250 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h) respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique (enflurane; mean concentration 1.5 vol%).	2.9879165071095035
In three groups of patients (each n=15) undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities, induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital (1 - 1.5 mg) followed by succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) to facilitate intubation.	3.946367743708108
For the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium bromide was used.	3.2816107144216464
All patients were given droperidol to prevent postoperative emesis, and they were artifically ventilated with N2O/O2 (60: 40) to normal end-expiratory CO2 concentrations.	3.163528746434479
No anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility.	3.8899235680027
For this purpose 40 g lactulose in 100 ml of water was given to all patients via a gastral tube shortly before extubation.	2.9317546021962673
Lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it enters the colon, and H2 is released, taken up by the vascular system and exhaled.	3.1145167665990448
Postoperatively, patients were asked to exhale into a 20-ml syringe every 10 min.	3.073970523878395
The content was analysed for hydrogen (ppm), using an electrochemical sensor (GMI exhaled hydrogen monitor).	2.9148251765577173
From the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration (compared to the preoperative value), gastro-coecal transit time was computed.	3.1934963657036626
All three groups of patients were comparable in age, height and body weight.	4.068814141097173
Also, the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups.	4.089694988409695
Mean gastro-coecal transit time was 204 ( +/- 19.6 SD) min following enflurane, 302 ( +/- 32.8 SD) min following fentanyl/-midazolam and 210 ( +/- 28.8 SD) min following ketamine/midazolam anaesthesia.	2.9359988340582666
The gastro-intestinal inhibition after the opioid-based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test).	3.23457331387086
There was no significance between patients after ketamine-based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic.	3.291862435015718
When using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid, gastro-intestinal inhibition, especially in patients prone to have constipation, is likely to develop postoperatively.	3.535874435678634
In classical neuroleptanaesthesia and in analgosedation in the ICU, the simultaneous use of the butyrophenone droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid-related gastrointestinal motility.	3.3858757689999615
In a prospective study 20 patients were monitored with serial sonograms and radiographs during distraction osteogenesis at the lower limb.	2.8597650176239227
All sonograms were obtained in four planes using a 7.5 MHz transducer.	3.3466375449786407
The distraction gap was seen as a sonolucent area in all patients after corticotomy.	3.7678752460925606
Radiographical signs of beginning mineralization were seen an average of 48.3 days after the start of the distraction.	4.120186755006744
Exact measurement of the distraction gap was possible in all patients during lengthening.	4.594176878616093
Bone healing complications and hematoma could be detected by ultrasound.	3.5831744130768532
A rapid increase of bone mineralization was seen after the distraction was stopped.	3.2987565457833865
With increasing cortication of the regenerate bone, sonograms showed a hyper-reflecting solid line so that further mineralization and the time of removal of the fixator could not be assessed by ultrasound.	3.58585360095344
Ultrasound is more sensitive than radiography in identifying new bone formation during distraction, measuring the length of the distraction gap, and detecting early bone-healing complications and can therefore reduce the need for radiographs.	3.458300964279042
During a 1-year period, patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor.	4.4465291597786525
Also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ENT specialist and actual referral to our department.	3.0653857606999924
We then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy.	3.624525262543249
It was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter (median, 8 weeks) than that of patients who first went to their family doctors (median, 13 weeks) (P<0.02).	3.7378271820849585
The latter then took an additional 4 weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist.	3.072240946568217
Referral from the ENT specialist to our department took another 2 weeks, as well as our staging and pre-therapeutic management.	4.1210244575282
Our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy.	3.3955166592180888
Tumor patients with greater professional qualification went to their doctors earlier (P<0.0001) or more often went directly to an ENT specialist (P<0.002).	2.9134757025195652
Consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays.	3.250422001793414
The present study deals with long-term dimensional changes in cemented Müller-type total hip endoprostheses.	3.3750496757467046
Creep and wear contribute to different extents to the dimensional changes in polyethylene.	3.077505575093838
The total amount of polyethylene wear is represented by the displacement of the femoral head into the socket.	3.4136787883844733
Within the first postoperative years, the head shifts up to a relatively high rate of about 0.5 mm per year.	4.561857719595091
This rate diminishes after 5 years to an average of about 0.1 mm (ceramics) and 0.2 mm (metal) per year.	3.3444109293987467
Values exceeding 0.2 mm per year for the shift of the femoral head are considered to be unfavourable with regard to a probable loosening of the prosthesis.	3.8435911543606918
In this study we determined the orientation of the centre of the prosthetic head in relation to the wire marker of the polyethylene cup, comprising in all 369 total hip prostheses.	2.9880285254221124
Using metal heads (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) this rate could only be measured in 71 % (n = 109) of the prostheses (61.5 months).	3.769347442497045
The combination ceramics-polyethylene produces half of the total amount of wear produced by metal-polyethylene.	3.2787201714695473
Younger patients should preferably be treated with a ceramic ballhead.	3.7745143978983036
The so-called amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare variant of dermatomyositis which has attracted increasing interest during the last years.	3.6255260189336567
One finds the classical signs of dermatomyositis such as periorbital edema and erythema, erythematous macular and papular lesions localized at bony prominences (so-called Gottron's papules), generalized pruritus, photosensitivity, and a cutaneous histopathologic picture compatible with skin lesions of dermatomyositis.	3.062763167560299
Crucial for the diagnosis is the exclusion of myositis by clinical examination, EMG and histology.	4.371186649761925
Furthermore, longterm supervision of patients is advisable in order not to miss the appearance of early signs of myositis.	3.4487832223655137
The longest reported follow-up of amyopathic dermatomyositis patient is 4 years; however, it cannot be excluded that these cases will eventually culminate in classical dermatomyositis.	3.4259878445039544
In this paper we describe two cases and discuss the differential diagnosis and therapy; also, the term "Premyopathic dermatomyositis" is proposed, to indicate that the full picture is to be expected in most cases.	3.5919483630775484
The primary renal angiosarcoma is a rarely seen highly malignant tumor.	3.1929488679126314
Making a diagnosis based on histology may prove difficult.	3.5364570652378635
Because of hematogenous formation of metastases and bad prognosis in most cases we recommend that the surgical intervention be followed by the well tolerated systemic chemotherapy with Doxorubicin and Ifosfamid.	3.913419270748475
This study compares the results of the outpatient-based program of the Cochlear Implant Center Ruhr with inpatient-based rehabilitation, which is almost exclusively performed in Germany.	3.240797473952874
The Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Essen in Germany provided 52 patients with either 22- or 24-channel Nucleus cochlear implants from March 1996 to July 1999.	3.2218445138345544
Almost all patients (n=49) were rehabilitated on an outpatient basis, which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside Germany.	4.030997154138292
Syringe drivers are used in anaesthetics, intensive care and emergency medicine to deliver small volumes of highly potent drugs with continuous, constant and reproducible flow.	3.2523540837602325
For early recognition of interruptions of the drug delivery caused by occlusion of the infusion system, an alarm is triggered as soon as the system pressure exceeds a certain limit.	3.4498899701636665
The sensitivity of this alarm depends on the flow rate, type-specific cut-off pressure and the elastic parameters of the infusion system.	3.8191811070157047
The sudden release of pressure built up in the system after occlusion occurred can cause delivery of an uncontrolled drug bolus and hence an additional hazard.	3.2119418105457775
Methods: Six syringe drivers that are widely used in clinical practice were tested for alarm delay and bolus delivery in the event of an occlusion in the system.	3.5813787428974715
First, the alarm pressures at flow rates of 10, 50 and 100 ml/h were measured.	3.147965932691078
Then the alarm delay time and bolus volumes post-occlusion were assessed, using a basic infusion system (syringe+single infusion set).	3.152012295832948
Finally, several alterations to the system like extension, tap battery with germ filters or branching were made and their impact on alarm delay and bolus volume measured.	2.769347606253201
Results: Because of the great differences in alarm pressures between the devices tested, there were marked differences in the alarm delay at same flow rates.	3.9926837334264036
Predictably, there was an indirect proportional link between alarm delay and flow rate.	4.031554503261832
Using the basic infusion system, alarm delays between 23 s and 143 min were measured.	2.941774372634344
In two of the tested syringe drivers, a pressure-release mechanism is activated with the pressure alarm, which prevented bolus application.	3.1541822513732694
In the other devices, release of the pressure in the occluded system caused boli of 0.5-7 ml.	3.3401943029767813
Variations in the actual syringe volume and insertion of a second connection tube had no impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	3.0599921147621454
Tap batteries, parallel running syringe drivers or trapped air in the system, however, caused marked increase in both alarm delay (107%) and bolus volume (+147%).	3.3016027924723597
Discussion: Unidentified occlusions of the system cause grave malfunctioning of syringe drivers.	3.3797558530558165
While applying highly potent drugs, the discontinuation of drug delivery with subsequent bolus application can cause vital danger to the patient.	3.0435807270188606
As a result of the significant time delays in the pressure alarms, the devices tested do not provide sufficient protection against unrecognized system occlusion.	2.9422466595035637
Syringe drivers with adjustable alarm pressure can be set close to the actual infusion pressure.	3.3025360894783247
A further important point is that one should aim at a reduction in the elastic properties of the infusion set because of the great impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	3.5474513504094345
However, minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous K-wire pinning are being increasingly used.	3.3330142745250173
A justified indication for the use of K-wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short- and long-term anatomic and functional results.	3.9840578307150007
Short-term supplementary immobilization with a minimized plaster cast or protective external fixation is generally considered to be useful.	3.6702743644480966
Reports on plaster-free functional treatment after K-wire pinning have been published.	3.1550964159341537
The indications therefore need to be further specified.	3.682458950429047
Follow-up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in K-wire stabilization and good-to-very good results in 75% of the cases.	4.3159286641179255
Involvment of the genitouronary tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare.	3.0843026795144155
Rapid proliferating Burkitt's lymphomas could mimic acute diseases.	2.99866407575101
Due to the extreme chemosensitivity, the lymphoma is cureable and surgery should be done only for histology.	3.114819128029001
Initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease.	3.5182503462178416
In any case a multiagent chemotherapy is necessary.	2.9036960410299284
Wet autoclaving is a simple, reliable and time-effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed archival material.	3.293314409326131
Both routine diagnostic (e. g., oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cytoskeletal proteins) and research antibodies (e. g. various p53 antibodies, mdm-2, bcl-2, MIB-1) are reported to demonstrate its application.	3.4676814101607807
Wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin-embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections.	2.8308792301711794
The technique has the poten-tial to reliably handle up to 200 sections at a time, without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology.	3.3499065843938785
Classical stable plate osteosynthesis with its anatomical repositioning, absolute stability between fragments and medial support should only be applied to joint fractures and spongy bone.	3.1533259333754198
In cortical bone, the anatomical reposition connected with the plate promotes bone necrosis along the fracture and prevents callus formation.	3.389385983602726
Direct cortical synthesis, a method also known as "primary bone healing", serves the bone's revascularisation and is not necessarily aimed at healing.	3.3639176298010662
Thus, this may also be termed "necrosis healing".	3.375478515316818
Along the shaft of long bones, elastic plate osteosynthesis, a biological method, is safer than and superior to the rigid technique.	3.3422508244199194
This even applies to short oblique and transverse fractures insofar as nailing does not appear feasible.	2.876142619847332
Elasticity is achieved by leaving a flexible stretch of at least 2 - 4 holes, i.e.	3.6432516884427715
as long as possible, without screws over the fracture and by employing a titanium plate.	3.975886995036941
The fitting of third fragments is deliberately left out.	2.993407996202593
The same applies to all kinds of compression with lag screws, tension devices or DC-gliding holes - and this with the intention of allowing micromovements in the fracture's fissure.	2.790972406603521
Periost and muscle are not removed and the fracture is not examined.	3.6627324689475027
Histomorphological investigation dates the first woven- bone bridges between the fragments to 3 weeks subsequent to the accident.	3.1880265924372915
In Göttingen University trauma centre, 87 fractures have been attended to over 2 years using this technique.	3.1025648442513245
Despite considerable soft-tissue damage, no delayed bone healing, pseudoarthrosis or bone infection has been observed.	3.3886049072840816
The risks of elastic plate osteosynthesis lie in unbiological and exaggerated reposition methods, too short a flexible stretch, and insufficient anchorage of the screws.	2.855420737157314
Diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100% certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography.	3.233344486432445
A correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner.	3.721472874222156
Both methods are available throughout Germany.	3.1402891469632688
Although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations, duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive.	4.008394741141734
Phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified.	3.1743133127365826
This applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered, if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined.	3.2683556026403364
Discrepancy between clinical findings and the results of duplex sonography also constitutes an important indication for phlebography.	4.0341291492447
In many institutions, both methods are used in a "golden partnership" in cases in which it is important to obtain comprehensive records.	3.8860275235042137
For frequent ventricular ectopic beats, currently, reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the mainstays of treatment.	3.2622112814792565
This study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients.	3.1220206098289136
Catheter ablation was performed in 65 patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats.	3.9286884027867357
The site of origin of ventricular ectopic activity was accurately mapped by using pace mapping, earliest endocardial activation time, and unipolar mapping.	3.1432918487433144
In 5 patients a new non-contact mapping was additionally performed.	2.9217218818773416
The ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in 37 and in the left ventricle in 28 patients.	4.280574643002036
Ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49/65 patients (75%).	3.2722552798597286
During a mean follow up of 13 +/- 11 months, 9 of 49 successful ablated patients (18%) had a recurrence.	3.7600618520092066
Radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity.	3.2170473510459647
It may, therefore, be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic, drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity.	3.8287070460400754
Injuries of the forefoot are a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons.	3.3993579276509687
After healing of bone and soft tissue damage, posttraumatic metatarsalgia can persist.	4.279170907024951
The paper presents a therapy algorithm with newly designed insoles, which consist of the common orthopaedic adaptions like a rocker bottom and a stiffening of the sole.	2.9342761250370475
The therapy is shown on two cases.	3.5200404850593596
With these orthotics adequate is possible and pain relief realistic.	3.6219245631833252
Background: Myopic PRK up to 6 D is an approved and safe procedure.	3.295065402287449
The efficacy and safety of combined treatment of myopia and astigmatism in compound myopic astigmatism (PARK) have not yet been demonstrated.	3.352676602719056
Nitric oxide (NO) can play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission, as well as in non-specific immunoreactions and inflammation in a variety of tissues.	3.8759505647271295
Increased quantities of nitric oxide in respired air can be measured during inflammatory processes.	3.399977165531721
However, the exact role and precise sources of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions within the airways remain to be defined.	3.123655583685081
We report on a 55-year old patient who presented with a four month history of intermittent left thoracic painful attacks which radiated in the left arm.	3.5991016897389505
Both normal 12 lead electrocardiogram and treadmill stress tests showed no significant ST changes.	3.263526302066285
The consecutively performed diagnostic catheterization revealed a severe, almost pouch-like proximal aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a maximal diameter of 15-20 mm as well as an aneurysmatic modified left coronary artery and an impaired left ventricular function (EF 49%).	3.809336760563998
In the absence of coronary artery stenosis, the patient was treated conservatively with an ACE inhibitor (lisinoprile 20 mg/day) under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with coumadin.	4.284306415239171
With this strategy the patient has been asymptomtic during the eight month follow-up period.	3.0894544733680056
Mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3.8  +/-  1.1 days (initial dosage 0.25 mg/kg/per hour, dose adjustment by the nursing staff).	3.4837356829116426
Mean tramadol consumption was 0.21 mg/kg/h on day 1 and was reduced to 0.08 mg/kg/per hour on day 4.	3.669630786910266
Median pain score (assessed with ten-step scales) was 5 before treatment and between 2.5 (day 1) and 0.5 (day 5) during therapy.	3.2919969097284723
Lowest oxygen saturations (mean) ranged from 93.8 % to 95.2 %.	2.975924382930157
Pruritus and extreme sedation did not occur.	3.063435918431172
The continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children.	3.4306026819277706
Over the past 5-7 years, there has been a renewed research interest into the mechanism as well as the development of newer "emerging" treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation.	4.124501973359822
One of these novel therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator.	2.909401127510673
In this article we will review the basic and clinical research which has been used in the development of electrode systems and shock waveforms utilized by commercially-available implantable atrial cardioversion devices.	3.4063663342164174
In 26 patients with abscesses in the maxillofacial area, the electrolyte concentrations, pH and osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of the pus fluid were measured and calculated.	2.9818042757464274
The main cations identified were sodium (134  +/-  38 mmol/l) and potassium  (37  +/-  16 mmol/l) and as anions chloride (183  +/-  46 mmol/l) and bicarbonate (10  +/-  4 mmol/l).	3.01106731025693
The pH value of the pus liquid was 6.164  +/-  0.233.	3.194856163199543
The calculated mean osmotic pressure of the pus liquid was 7910  +/-  1455 mm Hg, whereas the measured physical pressure inside the abscess was 49  +/-  13 mm Hg.	3.109687815388171
Both pressure types show time-dependent pressure curves.	3.6408882969730545
With time, the real pressure inside the abscess cavity increases, whereas the osmotic pressure decreases.	3.456293213078312
There was no relationship between the two pressure types and the different species of microorganisms responsible for the inflammation.	3.946863871878577
The results of the study reveal that abscesses can be regarded as osmotically active systems, and the mechanism by which the abscess is formed might be as follows.	3.652819445557286
After penetration of virulent microorganisms into the tissue space, the area of acute inflammation is walled off by the collection of inflammatory cells.	3.3944000766000655
Destruction of tissue by products of the polymorphonuclear leucozytes takes place and results in liquefactive necrosis and a hypertonic abscess cavity.	3.0724531959240204
The inwards-directed flow of tissue fluids into the cavity via the abscess membrane causes volume expansion and generates pressure, two facts that can explain the swelling dynamics and typical symptoms of abscesses in the maxillofacial area.	2.8040906060884243
Internal mammary artery (IMA) bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium.	2.9874041262639737
Their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia.	3.200128023253254
This study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the IMA graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia.	3.8238733719698406
Twenty-five patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the IMA as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries.	3.213667833276969
Distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood-cardioplegic  arrest.	2.9628679267502984
After unclamping the aorta and IMA graft, the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion.	3.106578504013892
A sufficient IMA graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature: The cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course, respectively.	2.7710238412701615
The rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side, and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side.	3.6983216334264726
An insufficient IMA graft function could be recognized by atypical temperature courses.	3.203661584731714
Fabry's disease (Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum) is a rare X-chromosome linked recessive disorder belonging to the group of sphingolipoidoses.	3.7720998878954504
The basic defect involves the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase.	3.114825357448828
Because this enzyme is responsible for decomposition of glycosphingolipids, its deficiency results in their accumulation in endothelial and smooth muscle cells.	3.11231657332274
With time, generalized angiokeratomas, paresthesias, renal and cardiac insufficiency and cerebrovascular complications develop.	2.800000396913638
We report a patient who in addition to the well-described findings also showed unique nail fold capillary changes not described so far.	3.0774740330770083
Analysis of serum concentration of alpha-galactosidase identified three female heterozygous carriers in the patient's family.	3.1717334453747448
Benign, proliferative changes of the Brunner's gland are very rare and account for about 10 % of duodenal bulb neoplasias.	3.5693091306615607
The authors present a case of Brunner's gland adenoma of unusual dimensions (12 x 5 x 2.5 cm).	2.962430509684174
The patient presented with vague epigastric discomfort as isolated symptoms.	3.052910604850254
In this case we performed surgical treatment, including a duodenotomy and polypectomy.	3.383607870765446
Because they are localized in the submucosa small, superficial endoscopic biopsies may fail to confirm the diagnosis.	3.0501747814969526
Malignancy seems to occur only very rarely, with only 14 cases reported in the literature.	3.077287596636139
As the majority of Brunner's adenomas are quite small, endoscopic polypectomy will confirm the diagnosis and cure the condition in most cases.	3.684484307653451
Large symptomatic adenomas may require surgical resection.	3.289056971295535
Objective: How does adjuvant training of strength and endurance influence the muscular, cardial, respiratory, immunological systems, and the quality of life during intrahepatical chemotherapy in a veteran athlete with liver metastasis after resection of a carcinoma of the rectum.	3.5552312469261036
Patient and method: A 58-year-old athlete with metastatic carcinoma of the rectum (pT3, N0, M-liver, G2) underwent regional chemotherapy (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil) via an intrahepatic port system.	3.224891343962307
Six cycles with 5 days each were applied.	3.3327302847037132
During the intervals between cycles (14 days), beginning in the 6th postoperative week, a strength and endurance training (duration 13 weeks) was carried out twice weekly with an intensity of 40-60 % of the maximum postoperative individual power and endurance (evaluated with weight and treadmill exercise tests and measurement of lactate).	3.3205949161761303
Before and after chemotherapy, an echocardiogram, resting and exercise electrocardiogram, lung function, natural killer cells and the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GLQI) was evaluated.	3.365971988272468
After chemotherapy was finished, the effects of training were assumed.	3.8991266329721794
Results: Strength increased between 0 % and 144 %.	3.2580100563038656
Endurance improvement was measured on the last comparable submaximal intensity step, expressed by reduction of heart rate and lactate concentration by 10 and 21.5 %, respectively, improvement of lung function regarding FEV 1 and FCV by 12.9 and 11.3 %, respectively, and VC IN 11.4 %.	3.2409951548670715
The relative count of natural killer cells increased by 27.2 %, and the GLQI improved from 109 points (pathologic) to 129 points (normal).	3.2208381414392315
Conclusion: There were positive effects on muscular and cardial mechanisms of adaptation and on illness-related quality of life.	3.094303851565396
Introduction: We report our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy in comparison to open nephrectomy in geriatric patients.	4.045627670138961
Material and Methods: Since 1993, a total of 249 patient have undergone a nephrectomy for benign renal disease.	3.4006124533066906
In 131 patients a laparoscopic nephrectomy (in most cases via a transperitoneal approach) was performed and in 118 patients an open nephrectomy via a flank incision.	3.5444145152131354
Clinical parameters were compared between both groups as well as with respect to different age groups.	4.520528327445383
Patients in the laparoscopy group demonstrated significant advantages with respect to blood loss, transfusion rate, analgesic consumption, hospital stay, and convalescence.	3.776434417863087
The complication rate was comparable for both groups; however, both groups showed an elevation of the complication rate in the age groups 75 to 84 years.	3.4769476528852334
The mortality rate within the first 30 days after nephrectomy was 1.7% in the open nephrectomy group.	3.369156927454902
Conclusions: The laparoscopic nephrectomy offers comparable operative results (with less blood loss and a lower transfusion rate) when compared to open nephrectomy.	3.389536291007859
In terms of postoperative parameters, patients in the laparoscopy group have significant advantages.	3.561607222849247
Especially geriatric patients benefit from these advantages and, therefore, the laparoscopic approach should be the preferred technique for a nephrectomy in these patients.	3.6200513602622437
The vast majority of adder bites among children in Germany is caused by the common viper (vipera berus).	3.1366032405366586
The venom that is applicated by the viper contains several enzymes, some of them with hemorrhagic and neurotoxic activity.	3.1748676503673066
Adder bites among children may be without any symtoms but as well may cause severe intoxication.	3.3214488220607428
The aim of this study was to evaluate the results after open Bankart repair using suture anchors in patients with recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	2.7590510898998017
Some 32 patients were prospectively observed for a mean of 40 months (24-60) after stabilization.	4.004793727882146
The mean age at the time of operation was 29.7 years.	2.8532133704863174
All patients were postoperatively immobilized in a sling for 3 weeks.	2.9898147288250434
According to the criteria of Rowe, 29 patients (90.6 %) had good or excellent results.	3.200766099685008
Two patients (6.3 %) developed recurrent instability 6-24 months postoperatively; 93.7 % were not or only slights limited in sports activities.	3.029183130188977
Bankart repair is an excellent treatment for recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	3.352142320688239
The use of suture anchors is an appropriate way of reattaching the capsuloligamentous complex to the glenoid to restore stability to an unstable joint.	3.009821229344862
Prospective ECG triggering of conventional CT scanners al- lows heart phase-triggered single-slice acquisition in the sub-second range.	2.944285296903706
The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the use of ECG triggering can optimize the evaluation of proximal CABG anastomoses.	3.4046700934475678
Multiple personality is known since last century und has been described by Breuer and Freud as well as by Kraepelin.	3.6330389307156516
In the latest and nearly exclusively angloamerican literature multiple personality disorder is included in the dissociated reactions in borderline personality disorder.	3.001424262722012
The concept of comorbidity is criticized.	2.9512754097142717
Case studies illustrate indications for diagnosing MPD.	3.2246136514259143
The authors point out, that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing.	3.527973662940444
But their development has its limits: In most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic "investigation" can be on a psychodynamic level a repetition of traumatic abuse.	3.5480331271319403
Many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years, and some have already found their way into clinical routine.	3.943289175483007
Cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment.	3.429797908156211
However, the short-term culture of oocytes before metaphase II does seem relevant.	3.0864683988533375
Blastocyst culture has mostly replaced coculture techniques and, given appropriate laws, provides adequate possibility of selecting embryos with high developmental and implantation potential.	2.9656293032721166
An exact pronuclear diagnosis also has a high ability to predict the probability of implantation.	3.7631605156963177
Viewing the latest data, assisted hatching seems to bring no improvements for most patients.	3.1602645670133174
Preimplantation diagnosis is being discussed in Germany due to new statements from ethical committees.	3.3844603729153224
Cytoplasma transfer, nuclear transfer, or the transplantation of spermatogenic cells into donors are currently only experimental.	3.4240635408019124
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	1.8784627116927504
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	2.254804042304058
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n = 98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	2.2950155272115493
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	2.2378254770371893
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	1.8374991796483011
In the years 1980-1992 surveys were undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of central nervous system infections in children in pediatric departments in the German provinces of Bavaria and Lower Saxony.	3.415115339334451
There was a very noticeable drop in viral meningitides over the survey years especially in mumps meningitis, i. e. from 199/205 in 1980 to 16/7 in 1992.	2.7365964911893736
In both states about 80 % of the viral meningitides could not be clarified etiologically.	3.8868413411749
Whereas in Bavaria a steady increase in herpes simplex encephalitides and varizella zoster encephalitides was apparent (1/4 in 1980, 10/24 in 1992), the same development was not found in Lower Saxony.	3.2540468512294107
Only in the case of herpes simplex encephalitis the rate of recovery shows a substantial improvement over the observation period, while for other forms the rate of partial recovery has remained approximately the same.	3.9617464033833154
Purpose: To assess patient reliability and compliance, most perimeters check for false-positive and -negative answers.	2.9598026841463367
In this study the results of catch trials were obtained with video campimetry with respect to age-related changes and differences for tests using increment and decrement stimuli.	3.3462808002883984
During a 7-year period (between July 1987 and June 1994) 19 patients were treated for Chopart dislocation.	3.3860385262305654
Seventeen patients were examined clinically 48 months following trauma.	3.643004330401767
We found 1 excellent, 6 good, 6 mediocre, and 4 poor results.	3.1969511157223787
Only 4 patients were able to achieve their pre-accident level of work and no patients could return to sports at the same level.	3.6244025062630545
In our patients, Chopart dislocation had a negative social consequence both at the work place and in recreational activities.	2.7951638543855313
In long-term follow-up, the Chopart dislocation was the most debilitating injury even for polytrauma patients.	3.498571440750831
For incidents of malignant hyperthermia (MH) outside the hospital, a high number of unrecorded cases must be reckoned with because of an insufficient knowledge of emergency services and poor identification and documentation that make it impossible to classify acute situations under the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia crisis.	3.4303856292652526
As a result, there are no statistical data in this field, and only case reports with a broad spectrum of suspected trigger mechanisms have been published.	3.646476462078182
The case described in this report is a proved example of a non-anesthesia-related triggering of MH in a 21-year-old man who had had an anesthetic-induced MH manifestation in childhood, which was confirmed with an in vitro contracture test.	3.599579039688263
After visiting a restaurant, he became unconscious and convulsive after consuming a high level of alcohol (2.9permil).	2.9086795574124693
The first cardiocirculatory arrest occurred directly before hospitalization.	2.946427249890273
After admission, the patient showed a full-blown MH episode whose subsequent fatality was unavoidable in spite of adapted and optimal therapy.	3.53554809336149
Suspected trigger mechanisms seem to be multifactoral (excessive alcohol consumption, over-heating, mental stress) as a forensic investigation did not point to any particular signs of typical trigger substances.	3.1070456676321676
The case demonstrates again that an MH attack might be triggered under certain non-anaesthesia-related situations.	2.861300044767159
For patients with an MH disposition, additional information on their behavior outside the hospital is required.	3.6024676127969597
Dipterous fly maggots of different species live worldwide as parasites in hoofed mammals.	2.9173320399842977
In the host the larval development causes typical boils, i. e., abscesses including the larvae.	2.7889339204374988
As a result of increasing tourist traffic, travelers can also bring back to Germany tropical types of myiasis.	2.6689577724706472
There is no question that source control is the most important treatment principle, but the role of additional treatment concepts such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage remains controversial.	3.6492373038560846
In a prospective survey (1993-1996) we analyzed the need for additional treatment concepts in our patient material.	3.8004486508031436
In 186 patients with diffuse peritonitis we applied the concept of source control and extensive (20-30 l) intraoperative lavage.	3.4171261212398245
Additional treatment principles such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage (n = 17) or staged lavage (n = 5) were applied only "on demand", namely in 20 patients (11 %).	3.2938849855925048
In 166 patients (89 %) source control of diffuse peritonitis was possible.	3.295451250196
The mean severity of peritonitis (n = 186) was 28.5 (range 16-43) using the Mannheim Peritonitis Index.	3.0547458371444525
The primary cause of peritonitis in our patients was perforation or leakage in the lower GI tract (52 %).	3.3140121668814446
The hospital mortality rate was 12 % in the whole group, and the postoperative morbidity rate was 34 %.	4.578904039292193
We conclude that nowadays, using high-quality intensive care as well as modern antiinfective treatment, only a few patients (ca.	4.058844034207894
10 %) need additional therapy measures such as postoperative lavage.	3.4574662965637395
Surgical source control in combination with intraoperative lavage is sufficient in most of the patients with diffuse peritonitis.	4.633930274247342
Native Tissue Harmonic Imaging is a new way of ultrasound image processing that addresses the difficult-to-image patient.	3.618179060476926
By using a Gaussian shaped transmit pulse it is possible to separate from the returning echo the harmonic component without overlapping with fundamental reflections.	2.851153072181805
The improved image quality leads to higher diagnostic confidence so that the use of further imaging modalitites is unnecessary.	3.630020955194392
Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the detection of calcified arteriosclerotic plaques with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).	2.9632509358991173
Method: 181 arteries were examined by 20/30 MHz IVUS.	3.582787164918003
The ultrasound cross-sections were compared to the corresponding radiologic (30 kV) and histologic cross-sections.	3.6949640245786046
Results: Calcified lesions were imaged as bright echos with shadowing.	2.8957833017272745
In 5 ultrasonic sections the diagnosis "calcified lesion" could not be verified neither by radiology nor by histology.	3.184513559772102
The sensitivity was 91.6%, the specificity was 94.7% and the accuracy was 93.0%.	3.1017532727600123
Conclusions: Because of the acoustic properties of calcium, calcified lesions can be detected accurately by IVUS.	3.193972051122507
IVUS can generate new insights into the effect of plaque composition on the response to catheter therapies.	3.7167114213026826
Hillel Klein has called the holocaust "the dark core of the twentieth century".	2.970534097546785
It was the aim of weekly conferences, held in Israel in 1994 and 1996, to explore its repercussions on current behaviour.	2.8469310234220355
The topic was "The past in the present".	3.5520961880449535
The participants were Israelis and Germans, the staff international.	3.046888312680139
The method used was the application of the "group relations conference", specially devised for these conferences.	3.2807197101486425
The leadership was in the hands of Eric J. Miller, director of the group relations program at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London, where this group method originated and continues to be particularly cultivated still today.	2.838487682808406
It is especially suited when an unconscious conflict between subgroups exists that emerges on the surface in forms which lead to confusion and misunderstandings.	2.8840381631973435
The task which had been put to the participants was as follows: to explore how feelings and fantasies influence relations within and between the two groups.	2.957359939102337
This was easy to remember but not always easy to adhere to.	3.180490217006915
There were moments when fantasy and reality got confused, accompanied by intense feelings.	2.7602290692377323
In this paper my experience with a databank for cases with bone diseases is reported.	2.9771664650896206
Adapting the system to state-of-the-art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment.	3.1346220703948555
This could not be accomplished by university resources alone, but only in cooperation with other research funds.	3.8166151693337524
Now 76 000 cases can be routinely accessed and scientifically analysed.	3.033139225054946
Background and purpose: In Germany, 750,000 children are born per year who should be screened for developmental visual defects in the age range 24-48 months.	3.153835604928823
However, the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia.	3.348521477447364
The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and microtropia screening.	2.5529633403102117
The fluorescence diagnosis based on the aminolavulinic acid-stimulated porphyrin synthesis allows the detection of superficial tumors in a very early stage even when they are very small tumors.	3.681488126188346
A fluorescence diagnosis of tumors in the oral cavity can be simply performed by rinsing with a 0.4% ALA solution for 20 min.	3.3469717392931155
This topical application avoids systemic side effects such as skin sensitization.	3.450482332798364
The red fluorescent areas are visible to the naked eye; only a blue light source for fluorescence excitation is necessary and a suitable red filter for observation.	3.0852345463408737
In our study on 56 patients suffering from carcinoma of the oral cavity, 96% of the histologically confirmed carcinoma could be visualized via fluorescence.	3.3833566135356623
In 3 patients additional tumors were detected via fluorescence that were not visible otherwise.	3.078615616916793
However, many patients show fluorescent areas with no correlation to the histological finding.	3.4995453836296777
It was verified that bacteria from the oral cavity also produce PpIX after ALA incubation, which leads to false-positive findings.	3.071166485770602
Reduction of the false-positive findings was achieved by rinsing the oral cavity with hydrogen peroxide and by mechanical plaque reduction.	3.3809473322859147
However, suppression of the bacteria fluorescence is necessary for clinical use of this diagnostic method.	4.104498491033908
Autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers.	3.158212237074804
Based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response, autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation.	3.9707421594969294
Increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude.	3.3151006948222608
Automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds.	3.7951745293118866
This case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a microdislodgement by means of autocapture.	3.840075557134568
The indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed controversely.	3.4732187983216427
Successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events.	4.492633519913139
However, several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events.	3.6903428287852775
Tissue engineering offers the possibility to fabricate living substitutes for tissues and organs by combining histogenic cells and biocompatible carrier materials.	2.9378415454789253
Pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells are isolated and subcultured ex vivo and then their histogenic differentiation is induced by external factors.	3.1672027350673373
The fabrication of bone and cartilage constructs, their combinations and gene therapeutic approaches are demonstrated.	3.560790789499194
Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are described by in vitro and in vitro testing.	3.988279026564955
The proof of histotypical function after implantation in vivo is essential.	3.028977267706833
The use of autologous cells and tissue engineering methods offers the possibility to overcome the disadvantages of classical tissue reconstruction - donor site morbidity of autologous grafts, immunogenicity of allogenic grafts and loosening of alloplastic implants.	2.9524294206579023
Furthermore, tissue engineering widens the spectrum of surgical indications in bone and cartilage reconstruction.	3.518359662540229
The purpose of this paper is to present principle and technique of proximal lateral column lengthening by calcaneal osteotomy and to critically analyze our preliminary results.	2.831546778535742
16 patients (7 female, 9 male; average age 52.3 years [24-72 years]) were treated for stage II to III posterior tibial tendon insufficiency by calcaneal osteotomy and medial soft tissue reconstruction (tendon reconstruction, 15; tendon transfer, 8; deltoid ligament repair, 10).	3.027867616203774
When the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Rating Scale was applied, these patients were shown to have significantly increased their scores from an average preoperative value of 49.1 to a mean postoperative value of 91.1 after a mean follow-up of 24.6 months.	3.413521541878106
In all but one case no loss of achieved foot correction was noted.	3.078800493748289
In one case, a fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint had to be performed after 5 months due to painful degenerative joint disease.	3.310749983846155
At follow-up, all patients had satisfactory restoration of their medial longitudinal arch, reduction of forefoot abduction, and restored arch height.	3.071568117700188
All patients were able to fully weight-bear the operated foot, and all patients were satisfied with the achieved result.	3.0922841815719626
In the pes planovalgus deformity occurring in stage II to III (as significant degenerative joint disease has not already occurred), osteotomies appear to have a significant role in the operative management and to function by restoring more normal biomechanics, thus allowing tendon reconstruction and tendon transfers to return to successfull function.	3.394274667636012
By the update of §24 a of the German road traffic act driving under the influence of drugs of abuse can now be fined even in absence of an actual driving impairment.	3.3353067241735013
Therefore for pretesting there is a need for fast and reliable immunological screening methods in blood/serum.	3.4271831916850433
The new Mahsan microtiterplate enzyme immunoassay (MTP-EIA) is claimed to be sensitive and independent of the matrix.	3.029162202461453
For an evaluation we carried out a comparison of the cannabinoid and opiate assays from Mahsan (MTP-EIA) and the routinely used Abbott fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) with a batch of routine serum samples.	3.062601083433146
For the MTP-EIAs we used the cut-off recommendations of the supplier (cannabinoids 2 ng/mL, opiates 10 ng/mL).	2.9412423923969384
For the Abbott FPIAs the serum samples had to be pretreated (deproteinization with acetone) and appropriate cut-offs were defined by our investigations (cannabinoids 20 ng/mL, opiates 30 ng/mL).	2.7591503836433118
Out of 136 samples screened for cannabinoids 42% were positive with GC-MS and 18% from 123 samples were positive for opiates.	2.926532067799801
The Abbott cannabinoid FPIA gave false negative results in 23% of GC-MS positive cases and 9% false negatives for opiates while Mahsan MTP-EIA gave no false negatives.	2.9312565811602465
Each of the two cannabinoid assays gave false positive results in 13% of the cases and for the MTP opiate assay 2% of the positives could not be confirmed with GC-MS. As a result of our study the cut-off values for the MTP-EIAs have proved to be suitable for a distinction between potential positives and true negatives.	4.010466563632848
Systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in 1978 by Mihatsch.	3.1042069364881444
Seven cases have been reported to date.	3.7064293962144323
We give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30-year-old Italian man.	3.44483578462541
Bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells, Schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and, less obviously, in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels, in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain.	3.5615587251184477
These findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis, nonspecific hepatopathy, adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple slerosis.	3.5261528071430868
The clinical course was marked by chronic renal failure, chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation.	3.322235078188893
The patient died 8 years after diagnosis in septic-toxic shock.	3.3808892376752966
The aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed.	3.726164175879091
17% of malignant melanomas (n=100) investigated in a dermatologic practice were less than 6 mm in maximal diameter (median diameter: 4.0 +/- 0.9 mm).	3.4922513132759736
The median age of the 17 patients at diagnosis of small-diameter melanomas was 42 years.	3.759504566113586
The essential epiluminescence microscopic and histopatologic features of these small melanomas resembled those of larger lesions, although their clinical criteria differed from the classic ABCDs.	3.138995649391553
6 (35,3%) of the small melanomas were were found to be in situ.	5.383584529436963
This percentage was nearly similar to those in situ lesions within the group of melanomas of 6 mm in diameter or larger (38,3%).	3.651728017127341
The remaining 11 small lesions were classified as invasive from Clark's level I to V, including all classic histogenetic types (superficial spreading, nodular, unclassified, desmoplastic).	2.8494058819879884
The median thickness of the small invasive melanomas was 0,76 +/- 0,23 mm.	3.4823008690275685
7 small melanomas had apparent histologic remnants of a melanocytic nevus.	3.016457870259474
Epiluminescence microscopic features of the melanomas were evaluated and statistically compared with those of 100 dysplastic nevi and 50 spindle cell nevi.	3.477589905432846
The technique of epiluminescence microscopy allowed the identification of such malignant melanomas that could not be discerned by the naked eye or by a pocket-lens.	3.340015453727753
Mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential.	3.2854190250125734
It is widely distributed in soil and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons.	2.899211519024205
In recent years, there have been numerous reports of infections by M. gordonae in immunocompromised patients.	2.8880497180179527
In contrast, only four cases of skin infections by M. gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published.	3.1815585378729963
We report on another patient without evidence of immunodeficiency who developed an atypical mycobacteriosis after a thorn injury during gardening.	2.966136364744519
M. gordonae was isolated by tissue culture.	3.4385211945950194
The skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with doxycycline for three months.	3.1886600329336043
The article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors.	2.966047393008426
Biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic findings are discussed.	3.2085239660124265
It has been established, that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the parathyroids and the liver.	3.462928389716343
The underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear, however.	3.5907893078542967
In particular, one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia.	2.709899397663409
Furthermore, organ-dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist.	3.0459326023271363
Oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs.	3.999943789418663
The molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is, however, still unknown.	4.48381255322248
The authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor-specific MR contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function.	3.121119459216288
Receptor specificity of MR contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor-specific carriers to ligands.	3.7382476154295956
This concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity.	3.516131554736247
Specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor-organ contrast and therefore tumor detection.	3.115142656136893
with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers.	3.5244934628378894
Elastosis perforans serpiginosa can arise as a rare complication in patients with Down syndrome.	3.7246591350583884
It is one of the primary perforating disorders characterized by transepithelial elimination of abnormal elastic fibers.	3.3684959000066677
This may reflect an immunological reaction aquist elastic fibers.	2.773551017049537
We describe a 40-year-old woman with Down's syndrome whose skin lesions were histologically mistaken for lupus vulgaris for a long time.	2.714022432408884
The position of the talus and the os calcaneum has consequences for the architecture of the forefoot.	3.649911418310174
Medial tilting of the talus with vertical position provokes flattening of the medial arch and abduction of the forefoot.	3.558516131002398
Varus position of the calcis and lateral direction of the talus (as in residual clubfoot), however, causes supination and adduction of the forefoot.	4.106035592828607
Repair of deformities in the hindfoot therefore also influences the forefoot.	3.205370885613142
A large number of various osteotomies have been proposed at both bones.	3.303713043887253
The most popular ones are Dwyer's osteotomy at the corpus of the calcis and its modification described by Mitchell at the same location for correction of the cavus foot and the residual clubfoot, and the lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans.	3.097100470103745
Indication and operative technique of these three procedures are described in detail.	4.057846618574691
The closing wedge osteotomy according to Dwyer is indicated in cases of cavus feet.	3.563820421065062
In clubfeet the os calcis is usually too short and the medial opening wedge osteotomy provokes skin problems.	3.1436990334654125
In these cases an osteotomy according to Mitchell with lateral displacement of the tuber calcanei is more suitable.	2.82555618846354
In flat- and skewfeet a lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans can be indicated, especially when the load of the foot is bigger medially under the talus rather than at the lateral margin of the foot.	3.0881351772973304
If these procedures are carried out carefully, they have low complications rates.	3.0856588518239065
Between January 1994 and August 1998, 12 patients with 13 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis muscleflap.	3.282606018460284
One patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides.	3.1783960477890942
In all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection.	4.0972471487783855
The average duration of infection was 8.3 months.	3.3231541295900655
The patients had undergone an average of 3.8 operations.	3.864853196570174
Up to now there was no recurrent infection, controlled by clinical investigation, ultrasound and laboratory findings in all 13 cases.	3.6850772206767277
Follow up investigation occured 2.5 years (1.5-4.7) after flap transfer.	3.081743542469412
The flap is easy to harvest.	3.6777010990042935
He has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation.	3.240000280216216
The functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal.	3.115786914786652
That vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region.	3.1377376827491616
Information technologies have been integrated in gynecological oncology treatment and, therefore, new software has been established in hospitals and private clinics.	3.592701275960409
A German law for hospital tumor registration has attempted to unify the different strategies.	3.0258659987633467
All intentions to establish new documentation systems for tumor diseases need a standardized basic data set.	3.0690434190634273
Nevertheless, local governmental health organizations are not yet prepared to implement a global information system such as prenatal and perinatal care databases.	2.9521556713726076
Financial support and political work is therefore needed.	3.5398710115374623
To optimise the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis.	3.158396873213108
This includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials, human placenta and the rat model.	3.432874144449419
It supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis.	3.041607379012221
Since Manfred Bleuler's description of the clinical picture of late onset schizophrenia over 50 years ago, debate has persisted as to whether it is justifiable to differentiate this as a valid, independent entity from the group of classic schizophrenic disorders with early onset.	3.8963669024851924
As this review shows, this question cannot be answered unequivocally even now.	3.2790665700813144
It must rather be remarked that we have neither been able to decisively extend our knowledge since Manfred Bleuler's comprehensive contribution, nor managed to achieve a much sounder basis methodologically.	2.834625261419182
The reasons for this are the international conceptual and terminological confusion that has developed around this illness group, and on the other hand the methodological limitations of the empirical studies conducted on this clinical picture so far.	3.369068806602476
Definition of the problem: In parallel with public and philosophical discussions, there is an ongoing debate about euthanasia in theological ethics.	2.828575023034051
In this situation it is helpful to provide a systematic overview of the different arguments and judgements.	3.376928527493486
Arguments: A short introduction is followed by a first part dealing with the definition of terms.	3.5683736495673966
The second and major part concerning normative arguments is subdivided into three steps: the level of principles, the more concrete level of actions and finally the level of social consequences.	3.3158820451655235
The third part presents some reflections following the eudaimonistic ethical tradition (the ethics of a good life and death) focusing on the central question: how to find meaning in life when faced with suffering.	3.0035796688296252
Conclusion: It would be fruitful to intensify the ethical reflection both on the problems concerning the foundations of social life, especially the meaning of dignity, autonomy and inviolability of human life, and social consequences of a liberal practice of euthanasia.	3.0936286199851635
In this context ethicists are challenged to reflect on the different approaches to what is or can be a good life and a human death.	3.0043260628716673
Multimodal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinomas today is based on surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.	4.110423938452339
Despite the combination of all three therapeutic options, there is still a large number of treatment failures and therefore major questions remain.	3.9501903840982866
Recent investigations suggest that mutations of the p53 tumor supressor gene may account for some of the therapeutic failures.	3.440566101188184
Inactivation of the gene may be an  important determinant of the efficiacy of today's multimodal therapy protocols.	3.647971633072703
In 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity biopsy specimens were taken before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy.	3.6220433208494582
From all patients, biopsy and resection material was available for immunohistochemical analysis of p53.	3.613520341593867
After radiation treatment, 51 patients (57%) showed a complete response; 39 patients (43%) only showed a partial response or did not respond at all.	3.7803928343271034
Among the responders, 82% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive, whereas among the nonresponders only 56% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive.	2.53758711324649
The majority of the residual tumors were also p53 negative according to immunohistology after radiation treatment.	2.831305654851002
In our study, detection of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry seemed to be connected with a more radiosensitive reaction of the tumors.	3.313017062805256
Nevertheless, successful strategies for radiation therapy may need to take into account the tissue of origin and the status of p53 in the tumor.	3.8809336690341723
The human cartilage and bone is characterized by a remodeling during the life, well balanced by neosynthesis and degradation of matrix components.	3.219916871718353
In different joint diseases, it becomes imbalanced and the destruction of the cartilage supersedes the repair.	3.4118657784110957
In tissue processes in disease and in normal turnover of the matrix, these molecules are fragmented and released into surrounding fluids, in the synovial fluid, and then in the blood and the urin, where they can be detected.	3.865476455475099
The quantitative measurement in the synovial fluid is more specific than in the other body fluids.	3.738036656412635
The research process in recent years has suggested that these molecular markers of cartilage and bone matrix metabolism can be used to determine diagnosis, the disease severity rather than its presence or absence, the prognosis, and the response to therapy.	4.29532416921008
They should help to identify the disease mechanism in different joint diseases not only on the tissue but also on the molecular level.	3.8167674517633006
The specific cartilage matrix markers promise to become useful tools in the future in clinical use.	3.52579432569978
The research in this area is still in the early stages, with most results dated from the end of the 1980s and the 1990s.	4.140949996127057
Axillary block is a common anaesthetic technique for operations on the hand and forearm.	4.1216289499295335
In our hospital, with many trainees in anaesthesia, only 250 - 300 axillary blocks per year are performed by about 30 colleagues.	3.0978093518660095
This implies a small number of blocks for each anaesthetist.	3.663205096679681
The present study was designed to assess whether it is possible to teach this technique and use it with an adequate degree of success under these conditions.	3.1812513309926542
We used a nerve stimulator and studied whether the success of the block under these conditions is independent of anaesthetist's experience in this technique.	2.8472801257063387
Furthermore, we examined other factors involved in the success of the block.	3.637162296131418
The study included 112 patients subjected to elective surgery of the upper extremity; all received an axillary block.	3.2157454789753586
We used a nerve stimulator and injected mepivacaine 1% without adrenaline.	2.407571888579779
The following parameters were recorded: the number of blocks to date performed by the anaesthetist; the minimal current required for nerve stimulation; the dose of local anaesthetic; the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery; the duration of surgery; and the quality of sensory and motor blockade after 10, 20, and 30 min.	4.2966137152372115
Sensory blockade was assessed by the pinprick method (no blockade, analgesia, anaesthesia); motor blockade was judged by comparing the muscle strength of both arms (no blockade, paresis, paralysis).	3.065620238202424
Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, with P<0.05 considered statistically significant.	3.0986709854187
Of the 112 blocks, 95 (85%) were successful; 17 (15%) failed and the patients required general anaesthesia.	3.435662513602908
Eight of the successful blocks showed a decrease in analgesic quality after >=70 min and required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia.	3.3295110657172557
We found no correlation between the experience of the anaesthetist and the success of the block.	3.4257746713716646
The minimal required current for nerve stimulation in the success group was 0.4 mA and differed significantly from the value of 0.6 mA in the failure group (Table 3).	3.091085324655194
Complete sensory blockade was more frequently achieved for the median, ulnar, and radial nerves than for the musculocutaneous and cutaneous brachii medialis (Fig.	2.9392894269080685
The frequency of complete sensory blockade (anaesthesia) had increased by 21.9% between the 20th and 30th min.	2.951812395960971
Complete motor blockade was less often achieved than sensory blockade (Fig.	3.152480193231918
Using the method of electrostimulation, the axillary block is an appropriate anaesthetic technique that can be applied in a hospital where each anaesthetist only occasionally performs it.	4.13367432077699
Prior to injection of the local anaesthetic, the current for nerve stimulation should be reduced to <0.5 mA.	3.7469914163801294
The time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery should be no less than 30 min because complete sensory blockade can more often be achieved.	3.1306324070143456
The dose of mepivacaine should be no less than 6 mg/kg body weight.	3.34974253325891
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was discovered 10 years ago as a growth factor that can regulate angiogenesis and in addition the permeability of blood vessels.	3.5022697994182583
Numerous studies have revealed that it is essential for normal embryonic development and that it plays a major role in physiological and pathological events of angiogenesis in adults.	3.5033844415236524
It is unique in that its expression is regulated directly by hypoxia.	3.067584325785867
Five VEGF forms of 121 to 206 amino-acids are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing.	3.017002800573896
Cells expressing VEGF usually express several forms simultaneously.	3.0776887722966775
VEGF121 does not contain exons 6 and 7 of the gene and consequently lacks a heparin binding ability.	3.563386197023945
However, this form is fully  active as an inducer of angiogenesis, and as a blood vessel permeabilizing agent.	3.1468455925906427
Exon 6 and 7 contain 2 independent heparin binding domains.	3.4400951142633156
The VEGF form containing exon 7 (VEGF165) and the vascular endothelial growth factor form containing exon 6 (VEGF145) display similar biological potencies raising the question of why so many VEGF forms are required.	3.169929824084726
It was found that VEGF121 diffuses better because it does not bind to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans.	2.7281793576561397
In contrast, VEGF145 binds to extracellular matrix ad is released from it slowly.	2.601730105280711
When the receptor binding properties of VEGF121 and VEGF165 were compared it was found that VEGF165 binds to a class of VEGF receptors that is not recognized by VEGF121.	2.9967576990853497
We have recently found evidence indicating the neuropilins form complexes with another VEGF receptor, VEGFR-1.	2.825504431996038
However, the biological function of this complex remains to be elucidated.	3.355493690139086
In addition to mucositis and myelotoxicity as well known early reactions after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck tumors, late toxicity following treatment is an often underestimated problem.	2.9339868540558824
The healing of wounds by secondary  intention is a simple method to close  operative defects.	3.683208177495263
The quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the  defect.	3.961043921881704
Best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave  geometry and when the defect lies  symmetrically at the interface of two  anatomic subunits.	3.3155304246666515
Partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric  defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention.	3.0226975406973504
This simple and efficient operative procedure is ilustrated by two case reports.	3.4147890403531322
Background: Acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a selflimiting lymphoproliferative disease of EBV-infected (immortalised) B cells and poly-/oligoclonal cytotoxic T cells which are to a high percentage EBV-specific.	3.3001970971520005
In B cells EBV infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of EBV nuclear antigens 1-6 (EBNA1-6) and membrane antigens 1, 2A and 2B (LMP1, LMP2A and LMP2B).	3.144638984399512
Expression of these EBV latent antigens leads to transformation and immortalisation of infected B cells.	2.9926513748109214
Here we examined if also lytic EBV genes (i.e.	2.72295137819646
BZLF1), which are associated with a productive EBV infection, are expressed during IM.	4.539095785803658
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a frequent underlying disease in young patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden death.	3.5298725827158033
Treatment is frequently indicated and is mainly directed at the prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	3.2958878159933054
In a minority of patients with progressive ARVCM and clinical signs of heart failure, pharmacological treatment with vasodilators, diuretics, and digitalis may be required.	3.9188202623688952
A prospective study was performed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a bone scan to detect subclinical invasion of the mandible by squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and floor of mouth.	3.839045563487531
The typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after strenous exercise.	3.285634188175856
Ocular muscle involvement with ptosis (in 50%) and diplopia (in 25%) are the most common initial signs.	3.6441582573672022
The disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles (generalized myasthenia).	2.9935215550582543
The muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can mislead to a diagnosis of neurasthenia.	3.255246663524738
Since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease.	4.534222175914774
Also, a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy.	4.751908210742886
The mainstay of the diagnosis is the history and a subtle clinical examination with tests of excessive muscle fatiguability.	3.774008823033254
The injection of edrophonium (Tensilon), the electrodiagnostic testing after repitive stimulation (decrement test) and the testing for serum antibodies against acetylcholin receptors have to be performed to secure the diagnosis of myasthenia.	4.032335994941446
Antibodies are present in 50% of ocular myasthenia and in 80-90% of the generalized form.	3.589819259348055
The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, other neuromuscular diseases, mitochondrial diseases, diseases of the cranial nerves, botulism and the rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have to be considered as differential diagnosis.	3.3121326582513917
The application of biodegradable implants is combined with advantages and disadvan- tages.	2.738791592488119
They offer a great deal of innovative ideas.	3.267214956353521
Best evaluation has been done with pins for the fixation of low loaded osteochondral fractures.	3.3366097379257034
When using 2,7 mm Polypin primary mechanical stabilility of distal radius fractures is comparable with the fixation by 1,8 mm K-wires.	3.2957129130857514
A prospective and randomised study with two years follow up, including 183 radial head fractures, showed no significant difference in results and complications in metal and polyactide implants.	3.721904307259984
For this localisation and other comparable indications the implant can be recommended.	3.4870154428307414
Despite the more extensive degradable device overall costs can be reduced with the polymer implant.	2.9104536078695653
Orien- truded polyactide screws showed good clinical results, newetheless resorption was extremely late within 5 to 7 years.	3.075018678480015
The treatment of deep cartilage defects is a challenge for every orthopeadic surgeon.	3.2715917623317803
The potention for regeneration of cartilage tissue is minimal and leads to mechanically inferior fibrous tissue.	3.048372198826417
The established techniques induce the growth of fibrous tissue but fail to prevent arthrosis.	3.315778869767649
Autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be the most promising therapy concept with clinical relevance to reserves a full thickness cartilage defekt with hyaline-like cartilage.	3.1895770082299966
Outcome studies with a follow up from 2-10 years show in up to 90 % good and excellent results for defects on the femoral condyle and 70 % for the patella.	3.9407396507327186
Mechanical testing of the regenerated cartilage showed almost simular stiffness as nearly normal hyaline cartilage.	2.9596299626475253
The available data justify the acceptance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation as a standard procedure for limited indications and well-trained surgeons.	3.4082803902077257
Result of already inaugurated studies will show the potential of chondrocyte transplantation to prevent osteoarthritis.	3.3909552123413067
Vasculitides are rare diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels.	3.8073742644836885
According to diameter of the blood vessels involved in the inflammatory process, the clinical presentation and the histological appearance, different vasculitic syndromes may be distinguished.	4.282814251221796
Primary vasculitides are of unknown origin while secondary vasculitides may be caused by drugs, malignancy or infection.	3.1695977029003006
Panarteriitis nodosa caused by chronic Hepatitis B and mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to chronic Hepatitis C are classical examples of vasculitides triggered by infections.	2.8417173258588395
However, these are rare complications of chronic viral hepatitis.	3.3577130905738723
Patients infected by HIV frequently suffer from vasculitis, which may be caused by opportunistic infections and by defects in immune regulation.	3.5141228267570885
In numerous case reports, various other infectious particles have been reported to cause different forms of vasculitis, either by direct infection of endothelial cells or by induction of an immunologic process leading to blood vessel destruction.	3.3794660724759713
After successful treatment of the infection, the vasculitis usually subsides.	3.4159237520603187
Therefore, all patients with vasculitis should be evaluated for underlying infection.	4.181756473671604
To calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre- and postoperative computed tomographies of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by USS (universal spine system).	3.145598043401058
Our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the dispaced fragments which was performed in all 32 cases.	4.006400237502817
We found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area (ASP preoperatively 55 %, postop.	2.757383413010581
80 %) and midsagittal diameter (MSD preop.	3.160697107814635
10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit, no neurological deterioration occured.	3.39273482147661
Fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise (52 %) and less midsagittal diameter (MSD compromise 51 %) than those without (40 % or 39 %).	2.9873064189876444
There was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit.	3.457821957762055
Below L 1 the spinal canal is greater than between Th 11 and L 1, so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated.	3.362183368383491
In case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis: an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is unneeded.	3.177542636196989
In fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long-term damages such as myelopathia and claudicatio spinalis.	3.0266588494237556
In common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury.	3.951600467309665
An exact diagnosis is mandatory as well as a differentiated therapy.	3.9528857934154686
Especially the correct decision about the therapy (operative vs conservative) including the technical demanding operative procedures is based on an experienced surgeon.	3.7315090437923017
The intensity of DNA degradation in fixed tissues is dependent on the fixation solution and the fixation time.	3.836452717993368
The aim of this study was the investigation of DNA degradation over fixation times of up to 70 days in different tissues (muscle, brain, liver, bone) and with different formalin concentration (2 %, 4 %, 8 %; unbuffered).	3.3330367364003433
An additional test was performed to see whether the fixed tissues could be individualized using PCR analysis.	3.472984929571949
The smallest amounts of DNA were extracted from liver and brain and the largest from muscle and bone.	3.1541772183447994
The amount of DNA that could be extracted decreased with increasing formalin concentration, while at the same time DNA degradation increased.	3.2489237408021197
With the PCR-VNTR system HUMTH 01, all fixed samples could be typed regardless of the fixation time and the formalin concentration.	3.132624514626232
The draining sinus is an unpleasant complication of acne conglobata, acne fulminans, acne inversa, rosacea conglobata and rosacea fulminans (pyoderma faciale).	2.4634095124972317
It is most common on the face, especially in the nasolabial folds, and on the neck below the mandibular line.	3.6864375202242607
Clinically, it is an elongated (2-5 cm long), elevated, periodically inflamed lesion, which sporadically discharges pus.	3.9166961849327064
The lesion persists with no tendency to spontaneous regression.	3.15700882477792
Histopathologically, it consists of elaborate, epithelialized galleries connected to the skin surface at multiple points.	3.2961061226251034
It contains corneocytes, hairs, bacteria, serum, inflammatory cells and epitheloid granulomas.	3.017387535349767
A surgical thread placed into the skin provides a model in which the generation of sinus tracts can be studied.	3.529847023166672
Intralesional corticosteroid injection, cryosurgery and isotretinoin are not always very effective.	3.3118818544109527
Sometimes complete excision of the lesion is necessary.	4.4128895576598515
The draining sinus is a special form of scar analogous to the pilonidal cyst.	2.7666358584249218
A thoracic outlet syndrome is only rarely caused by osseous anomalies.	3.1978789551949123
Instead, it is a soft-tissue disease, where the C8 and T1 roots or the proximal inferior trunk of the brachial plexus are compressed by fibromuscular anomalies between the inferior cervical spine and the first rib or pleura.	3.7608457749942295
Thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical diagnosis.	4.134573395803179
If surgery is recommended, it should be concentrated on the fibromuscular anomalies and not on the first rib.	4.196742489206324
Transaxillary removal of the first rib carries an important risk of serious complications.	4.733047102422804
Among these, brachial plexus injury is the most frequent one.	3.6809725208831807
Objective: The objective of this survey was to investigate the current status of the epidural and intrathecal management in patients with chronic cancer and non-cancer pain in Germany and Austria.	4.754798881656311
Methods: In June 1997 a questionnaire was sent to 598 German and Austrian anaesthesiologists specialized in pain therapy.	2.936114757978083
Questions concerning the use of medicaments for epidural and intrathecal treatment of chronic pain were asked.	4.358135636985741
Results: The response rate was 23%.	3.262971337557385
The data show that 78% of the anaesthesiologists use epidural or intrathecal analgesia in the therapy of chronic pain.	3.141662907542809
Local anaesthetics are used by 85% of these anaesthesiologists, followed by morphine (72%), clonidine (48%), buprenorphine (34%), baclofen (20%), fentanyl (13%) and sufentanil (10%).	3.289472878978819
In the 137 answering pain clinics 79.821 epidural and intrathecal analgetic treatments are performed per year.	2.8404433646511533
Discussion: Epidural and intrathecal pain therapy is frequently used in Germany and Austria, either as a complementary or alternative treatment to systemic pain therapy.	3.5251617043467065
Local anaesthetics followed by opioids are the most commonly used medicaments for this treatment.	3.245217015289479
For some of the applied substances neurotoxicological data are lacking.	3.731779098808142
The use of these substances has to be considered very carefully.	3.76929607008416
Intraartial conduction disturbances (IACD) are the known substrate of re-entrant atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy.	3.768626032741278
Signs of IACD can be missed on the standard ECG, and signal averaged (SA) P wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological (EPS) properties of atrial myocardium.	3.179214595378729
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing are known to electrophysiologists, but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice, and RAA based pacing modes remain standard even for pts.	3.3590876947907304
We examined and compared EPS effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools: IEGM obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system (via telemetry) and time domain analysis of SA P wave in 22 pts.	2.837500153879436
with BiA pacing system (implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and IACD).	3.1305428518624594
The results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently: RAA pacing aggravates IACD in comparison to sinus rhythm; the effects of CS pacing is less visible.	2.9554896576784992
BiA pacing normalises all atrial activation times.	3.318911223581583
The normalisation of SA P wave duration, reduction of SA P wave dispersion, increasing of RMS 20 and decreasing of LAS 5 and finally abolition of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts.	3.024932824859821
indicates beneficial effects of BiA pacing (in pts.	3.5825000243706335
with IACD) in comparison to sinus rhythm and RAA pacing.	3.896662669203429
Time domain analysis of SA P wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non-invasive evaluation of EPS effects of different modes of atrial pacing.	3.4732484116598963
Background: We report a case of irreversible unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy in connection with nasal septum surgery in intubation anaesthesia.	3.4398595912135335
On account of the spatial distance, there is no danger of injuring the hypoglossal nerve during nasal surgery.	3.1794747652992372
However, in the otorhinolaryngological and anaesthesiological literature, some cases of hypoglossal palsy following endotracheal intubation, use of the laryngeal mask airway, bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy are reported.	3.32929854414564
The endoscopic guided puncture tracheostomy has established itself in many intensive care units.	2.9645453615746105
Manufacturers offer complete tracheostomy kits, based on the described techniques from Ciaglia (Cook-Set), as well as from Griggs (Portex-Set).	3.4698803026421112
The goal of this investigation was to show the advantages, disadvantages, costs and risks of the puncture tracheostomy and to make a comparison using conventional procedures.	3.29292974090596
Chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis may occur in children, adolescents and adults, but has not been found in newborns or babies either in our series or in the literature.	3.930097241810066
Symptoms suggesting an acute disease like fever are uncommon, but a primary chronic course with symptomatic and asymptomatic periods is typical.	3.1427003278806573
Pain and swelling are the main symptoms; painless masses are rare.	3.5614468314681242
In children and adolescents the clavicle and metaphyseal regions of long bones are typical sites of chronic abacterial osteomyelitis.	3.2977001136685895
In adults the clavicles or the first two ribs are mainly affected with synovitis of the adjacent joints, but the long bones are rarely involved.	3.5359887784155473
Laboratory findings are non-specific but important for the differential diagnosis.	3.434458856440359
The sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein might be elevated.	3.381636547746655
The X-ray examination shows osteolytic, sclerotic or mixed bony changes and, in case of a diaphyseal involvement, onionskinlike periosteal bone formation may be present, suggesting a malignant process.	3.393907490517439
In late stages sclerotic bone formations may be seen as a rest.	3.103675928623004
Uni- or multifocal lesions can be detected by bonescan, as can asymptomatic lesions.	3.6249751471019613
Magnetic resonance imaging shows gross signal intensity differences both in the bone and perifocal soft tissue and involvement of the synovium with gadolinium DPTA enhancement in T1-weighted images.	3.1675511330005204
In early stages of the disease granulocytes, microabscesses and new bone formations might suggest bacterial osteomyelitis that cannot be differentiated by histology.	3.2222920567271633
In intermediate phases lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrates are found, whereas in late phases sclerotic bone formations and fibrosis of the bone marrow are seen histologically.	3.432791418709053
In chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis, all clinical, radiological and histological findings, as well as negative bacteriological cultures, are mandatory and will allow a definitive diagnosis to be made.	3.334975042621709
The disease may be uni- or multifocal, and new bone lesions may occur over time, as well as skin manifestations, which can be found years before or after bone involvement.	4.225010306552802
The association with dermatological diseases and/or synovitis led to the acronym SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteomyelitis).	3.30771624033432
For the treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for pain relief, reduction of swelling and dysfunction.	3.3903315164764747
Antibiotics have been used in several series and are not effective.	4.169495009981214
Major surgery is not recommended even for recurrences, and the prognosis for growth and function is excellent in the long term despite recurrences over several years.	4.37092346560486
A woman with severe stiff-man syndrome showed periodic cardiovascular dysregulation.	3.139655054584897
The blood pressure changed spontaneously every 5-10 min.	3.5064612274209703
This rhythm was also maintained after relaxation.	3.383275330985519
However, the vegetative and motoric disturbances disappeared after intrathecal application of baclofen.	2.708919866389288
It is speculated that spinal GABAergic mechanisms are responsible for the tonic regulation of the cardiovascular system.	3.3266369530436837
The frequency and prognostic relevance of sarcoid-likelesions and microcarcinosis in regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer (n = 113; pT1-3, pN0-1, pM0, R0) were investigated; the prognostic value was compared with pT and pN stage, grading and Laurén's tumor classification with Cox's multivariate regression-model.	3.228433486592567
Sarcoid like lesions were found in 34 % of the cases (n = 113).	4.637760027445672
Statistical analysis did not indicate that they had any prognostic value or showed whether or not microcarcinosis or metastasis was present; they were independent of pT stage, histological tumor type, tumor grading, and the clinical course of disease.	3.698154464071927
Microcarcinosis (defined as scattered carcinoma cells within lymph node sinuses or pulp without adjacent stromal reaction) was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 90 % of pN0 cases; the presence of 3 or more tumor cells per lymph node section in over 10 % of sampled lymph nodes per case carried a significant prognostic value.	3.0356776016339118
In microcarcinosis without evidence of metastasis, the number of tumor cells and the number of involved lymph nodes are of prognostic value.	4.594762639657508
In pN1 cases microcarcinosis was found as well as the metastases in 97 % and had no additional prognostic value.	3.7666366638447975
Microcarcinosis alone has a different significance from lymph node metastasis for prognosis.	3.3347421172497893
This article summarizes the most important results of the Turku Conference on active strategies for an aging workforce, which took place in Turku/Finland in 1999.	3.0264038155489392
About 140 experts from all EU-member states participated.	3.0284053714493626
The article can be seen as a contribution to the current change in the debate on labor market policy concerning older workers in Germany.	3.3950610479232464
The incidence of coronary artery aneurysm varies in the range from 0.2% to 4.9%.	3.75750198116567
Ninety per cent of these were associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, where vessel ectasia and poststenotic dilatations are not an infrequent finding.	3.4878617801522807
We present the case of a 67 year old patient with coronary artery aneurysm and coexisting coronary artery disease of the right coronary artery.	3.9701927561948587
We performed a PTCA and stent-implantation of the stenosis and coronary artery aneurysm of the right coronary artery.	3.379215822627468
A control-angiography will be performed six months later.	3.369256376580536
TMLR (Transmyocardial laser revascularization) is a disputed cardiosurgical technique available in Europe since 1994 that aims to deliver additional blood flow to ischemic myocardium from the left heart chamber.	3.1827708498894065
Goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions: Are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels?	3.663743042437851
We examined hearts of 10 patients who died during the first 18 days after TMLR.	4.036371481855487
Channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope.	3.713288072019059
Despite phagocytic removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks.	3.074054219957687
Open intramyocardial channels can be shown in all patients.	3.2711467702419044
These channels communicate with intramural vessels, but in no instance with chamber lumen.	3.3560055315189303
Our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood.	3.513003860019475
Additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium.	3.1623340005378324
However, our patients represent the small subgroup of the deceased.	3.3473568719847955
If similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptomfree after TMLR remains open.	3.898331827709286
Recurrent miscarriages are, like sporadically occurring miscarriage, often (approx.	2.986881338109213
50 %) due to chromosomal aberrations.	3.928178210898574
An undefined proportion of the other half may be due to immunological incompliances.	3.763874266150002
The basis for this assumption is the fact that the maternal immune system recognizes paternal antigens and rejects them.	3.1456534151494155
The initial hypothesis that such immune reaction is due to a high similarity between the maternal and paternal HLA systems (HLA sharing) is most likely incorrect.	3.3343956334166296
Nevertheless, the incomplete recognition of the fetus by the maternal immune system and the resulting insufficient protection is basis for the active immune therapy with partner or donor lymphocytes.	3.4583323141923747
Several placebo-controlled studies have been performed.	4.023271283724438
Due to the small number of cases, results were not significant.	3.6461925776022723
A metaanalysis of all studies, however, proves significant effects of the active immune therapy.	3.9862348412296904
The risks of active immune therapy led to the development of passive immune therapy with immune globulins (IVIG).	3.483643537413576
This therapy, however, is relatively expensive and obviously no more successful than the active immune therapy.	3.2617901219542516
In a metaanalysis of all published results, IVIG was not significantly more effective than treatment with placebo.	3.5014105739327595
The indication for both forms of immune therapy is given after 3 or more consecutive abortions, after exclusion of other reasons for these abortions.	3.134448895559678
It appears that only primary aborting patients are suitable for active immune therapy.	3.0116871819567512
Athough the concept of immune therapy is still under debate, alternative concepts are not available.	4.088161919240993
Hence, new therapeutic approaches are also not available.	3.437668593661969
The first electronic implantable hearing aids for patients with hearing loss are coupled to the ossicular chain or perilymph during implantation and are now available.	3.4085527195984424
Our new Tübingen implant designed for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the combination of an implantable microphone and piezotransducer.	3.512563019225128
To avoid hearing losses during implantation, the Tübingen piezotransducer will be (1) fixed to the mastoid cavity and (2) positioned to one of the ossicular target points.	4.077862935849518
This can be done with a micromanipulator which will be implanted together with transducer and microphone in the mastoid cavity.	3.078464058052246
The manipulator weights 0.7 g. With four degrees of freedom, it allows highly secure and safe positioning of the transducer's probe tip to the ossicular chain under close to stereotactic conditions.	2.9270626497031436
The main advantages of the present micromanipulator are (1) easy handling during surgery, (2) the transducer's precise positioning to the ossicular target point with sufficient degrees of freedom, and (3) the transducer's stable fixation in the mastoid cavity in the final position.	3.8751033454483625
Following integrated safety as the leading principle, ossicular or inner ear injuries caused, e.g., by the patient's head movement or unintentional manual contact by the surgeon, are minimized.	3.2393814269934915
The micromanipulator is, as it were, the surgeon's vibration-free "artificial hand".	3.590681867790418
The manipulator's development and its optimization to the mastoid cavity by test implantation in 50 human temporal bones are shown in detail.	3.1650050104633043
While coupling the transducer to the body of the incus, transducer, microphone, and micromanipulator can be implanted into 76% of all mastoid cavities without protrusion.	2.9864132911333394
In the case of transducers coupling to the long process of the incus, the protrusion-free implantation rate of the above-mentioned three implant modules is 78%.	3.196735179590009
The role of neuroimaging in the acute setting of head trauma is to diagnose the extent of intracranial injury and to identify all lesions which require urgent neurosurgical treatment.	3.388091509264784
Computed tomography (CT) remains the most important diagnostic tool for initial screening of trauma victims.	3.9756947040776627
Although magnetic resonance imaging (MR) has higher sensitivity to most traumatic lesions than CT, due to the ease and speed of CT, and the fact that sufficient monitoring of critically ill patients during the examination is much easier with CT than with MR, mean that MR is not the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnostic work-up.	3.902176023156286
Recent MR techniques such as FLAIR or diffusion imaging further improve the sensitivity of MR in head trauma.	3.355317711229433
Conventional angiography is currently indicated only for few suspected vascular lesions (e.g.	2.963673268084349
traumatic arterio-venous fistulas, vascular dissections).	3.181577049824188
Injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are among the major injuries to the knee joint.	3.9717239297543365
Today we are often confronted with an inapproprate and delayed diagnosis of this injury and its concomitant lesions.	3.3257225250996605
Additionally, the outcome of operative treatment has not yet reached an acceptable rate of satisfactory results.	3.5948810580842507
Therefore, the goal of this current concept review is to give a comprehensive insight into anatomy and biomechanics, injury mechanisms and pathobiomechanics, based on our experiences and data from the international literature.	3.475026079938865
A further goal is to clarify diagnostic problems with respect to clinical examination and imaging techniques.	3.893950273850039
We also present a differential concept for the perioperative and conservative management of posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees in order to also adequately address concomitant injuries such as posterolateral rotatory instability and combined anterior cruciate ligament injuries with the aim of further improving results.	3.4867524441217017
Sevoflurane, like all currently used volatile anaesthetics, is degraded by carbon dioxide absorbents.	3.0034744964763993
The most significant degradant is a haloalkene known trivially as "compound A".	2.9166268070983397
Compound A is nephrotoxic in rats and, at higher doses, in nonhuman primates, causing proximal tubular necrosis.	3.2680408932374143
There has been much interest in the potential for compound A toxicity in humans.	3.064824427010691
Inhaled compound A concentrations are greatest at low flow rates, high sevoflurane concentrations, warmer absorbent, barium hydroxide vs soda lime, and drier absorbent.	2.874864579589289
Typical inspired compound A concentrations during low-flow and closed-circuit sevoflurane anaesthesia in humans are 8-24 and 20-32 ppm with soda lime and barium hydroxide lime, respectively.	3.1072717345867558
Renal effects of compound A production during sevoflurane anesthesia have been examined in surgical patients and volunteers, using standard (creatinine clearance, serum BUN and creatinine) and experimental (urine excretion of protein, glucose, NAG, GST, AAP) markers of renal function.	2.730926257976935
Investigations to date in surgical patients show similar renal effects of low-flow sevoflurane, low-flow isoflurane or high-flow sevoflurane.	4.285331603116483
There have been no case reports of compound A-associated renal injury in humans.	3.0851298162141
In volunteers, one study found changes in experimental but not conventional renal markers, while other investigations show no significant changes in either standard or experimental markers.	3.0589356127288037
The mechanism of compound A nephrotoxicity in rats appears to involve metabolism to glutathione and cysteine conjugates, and their subsequent renal uptake and metabolism by pathways that are different in rats and humans.	2.9283057590236607
In the report of the 1995 World Health Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, the definition of heart muscle diseases was updated.	2.6867557994229228
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of inflammatory cardiomyopathy are now recognized in this definition.	3.283337933078043
Enteroviruses, adenoviruses and cytomegaloviruses are considered as main etiopathological factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease.	3.700607194773581
We report our experience in managing a temporal bone fracture after head trauma that had no apparent clinical signs.	2.971938835008309
Recurrent CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures.	3.0490471535229617
Operative exploration of the temporal bone demonstrated a fracture line along the horizontal part of the carotid artery.	3.6755355286670537
The location of the fracture did not cause such typical symptoms as hearing impairment, facial paralysis, vertigo or tinnitus.	3.1104486253167103
Only CSF liquorrhea through the Eustachian tube indicated a fracture at the lateral skull base.	3.3296489109319336
Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans (Flegel's disease) is a rare but clinically and histologically highly characteristic genodermatosis.	3.4337247427275424
We report on new immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings suggesting a complex disorder of epidermal differentiation.	2.97287143622729
In this context, a good response to calcipotriol, a synthetic vitamin D3 derivative is of particular interest.	2.9777786598708325
Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially life-threatening event with uncharacteristic clinical manifestations.	3.485981387014353
Diagnosis is commonly established by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography.	2.966794079007841
Both methods, however, carry substantial drawbacks.	4.102703259818174
Therefore, clinicians claim that there is a need for an accurate and non-invasive diagnostic modality.	3.8536638521938125
Spiral CT of the pulmonary arteries is a recent modality, that allows reliable visualization of emboli in pulmonary arteries up to fourth-order branches.	3.3252579272608513
This paper reviews the technical aspects, typical findings and diagnostic pitfalls of this recent technique.	2.8950828370806465
The potential role of spiral CT in the screening of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism is discussed and selected cases are presented.	4.451880658206994
Contradicting results have been reported with regard to leukocyte release and systemic concentration of IL-12 after polytrauma.	4.485625233172401
Methods: We daily analyzed systemic concentrations of IL-12 in polytrauma patients (n = 37, mean ISS 33.9) in comparison to healthy donor values during intensive care course by ELISA.	3.247654991325864
Patients were divided according to their mean IL-12 levels into those with elevated IL-12 (group 1, n = 7), those with decreased IL-12 (group 2, n = 4) and those with IL-12 in the normal range (group 3, n = 26).	3.795788832511335
Results: Patients in group 1 revealed elevated levels of IL-12 up to p70 > 1000 pg/ml and p40 > 2500 pg/ml.	3.414400502528708
The common clinical feature of group 1 was a thorax trauma in combination with pneumonia (85 % survivors).	3.322142739622876
Patients with decreased IL-12 levels revealed also a thorax trauma and pneumonia but all patients succumbed.	2.9071109261926207
The groups significantly differ in their stay in the intensive care unit, in TISS, in MODS score and in respiratory ratio, but not in ISS, mean CRP values and leukocyte counts.	3.3917786129416876
Correlation analysis revealed no significant relation between systemically altered IL-12 values and clinical parameters, with the exception of a negative correlation of p70 and ISS (r = -0.785) or MODS score (r = -0.314) in group 1.	3.6345796248251463
Conclusions: After major injuries there is no overall suppression of IL-12 formation.	3.855685579586114
Patients with normal or elevated IL-12 levels belong mainly to the survivors, whereas patients with decreased IL-12 levels are at high risk of succumbing to multi-organ failure.	3.0194441871100253
This article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome.	2.920554410304543
Shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the coracoacromial arch, mainly in forward flexion of the arm.	3.4184083918168633
Stage I relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon.	3.201404593031689
Stage II is characterized by bursal inflammation and fibrosis, as well as tendinopathy.	4.653835248794628
In stage III there is a tear of the rotator cuff.	3.8896921813266725
Moreover, calcifying tendinitis, fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome.	2.914566114731765
Imaging is important for the exact diagnosis.	4.184816916476414
Standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome.	3.642987837781174
They may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity, subacromial spurs, and form anomalies of the acromion.	3.2021694913159373
They are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis, fractures and neoplasm.	3.3046161305888075
Ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors.	3.651602900170064
However, there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears.	3.3277397695201243
Its usefulness has therefore been questioned.	3.4876850501964833
MR imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures.	3.860112408490697
Several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings, such as tendinopathy versus partial tears, may be difficult with MR imaging.	3.9994303077135887
However, reproducibility for full-thickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography.	3.282605896040621
Moreover, specificity appears to be superior to sonography.	3.6370923250743235
MR arthrography is not universally accepted.	3.307392983759337
Standard arthrography and CT have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff.	4.133770922807343
Gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type (according to Ming) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only.	3.349073231559522
Over the past 18 years, we have observed 23 cases of this tumour type, accounting for 3.6 % of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas.	3.5516005735151586
Macroscopically they were classified as Borrmann IV or III, while histologically most of them were well differentiated.	3.7328794009222617
Histologically, these tumours retained the pre-existing structures of the stomach, most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic, particularly in the submucosal and subserosal layers.	3.1091096691584474
In all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels.	2.660115807776311
All but 2 cases with metastatically involved lymph nodes, often small, showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus; in three quarters of cases the serosa was infiltrated by the tumour.	3.5438975402771815
Significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom Billroth II operation had been performed.	3.2206286021983845
The mean survival time of 16 patients was 14.9 months.	3.497076480030926
Owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth, extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of signet ring cell cancer.	3.6676021094359266
The high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging.	3.7954252201619925
Preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult, because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification.	3.6584780034652837
Close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary, and intraoperative assessment of the tumour - including frozen section of necessary - in particular is of the outmost importance.	3.7150614932316186
One rare case of so-called massive idiopathic osteolysis Gorham-Stout is presented.	3.3156655126595282
In a 77-year-old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2.5 month following trauma.	3.5330857446851254
As a histologic cause for the osteolysis, a marked stimulation of osteoclasts on the spongiosa, especially intracortically, was observed.	2.941612097345634
The course and the clinical findings are described, and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature.	6.021769349117421
The results suggest that an early antiresorptive therapy (calcitonin, bisphosphonates) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes.	2.8843987019214006
In this paper the relationship between psychodiagnosis and client-centered therapy is discussed.	2.8957806452185886
Rogers is wrongly said to have rejected any kind of diagnosis and that this therapy form has therefore developed an ambiguous relationship to this issue.	3.3719941006669063
If one sees psychodiagnosis as something psychodynamic, and symptoms as defense strategies against underlying conflicts, then a comprehensive 'status diagnosis' using more or less traditional psychiatric categories appears compatible with theory-led client-centered diagnosis in the initial phase and during the course of therapy.	3.105453753754164
Client-centered psychotherapy itself may be seen as a continuous process of dialogue in which 'assumed diagnoses' (embedded in the therapist's 'empathic knowledge') are jointly checked and in which the client through direct experience learns to understand and change his 'diagnosis'.	3.1160974632425615
In the examination of reversible segmental (articular) hypomobile dysfunction (blockage) of the spine, we have to recognize by palpation the feeling of beginning resistance at the end of the passive movement ("barrier").	3.581361406721592
This is the main finding to diagnose segmental (articular) dysfunction.	3.0102998006595874
Normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end.	3.453917137678902
In contrary, the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction, i. e. restriction of joint facet gliding.	3.071130875717567
Multiple intra- and paraglandular lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland, including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations.	3.30765614203153
In the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes.	3.648736778434633
Except for the frequently occurring Warthin tumours, primary salivary gland tumours, which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes, are rare.	3.7617308356581223
Examples of these are adenomas (pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma) and carcinomas (acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma).	2.973274103489926
Three of our own observations (sebaceous lymphadenoma, acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma) are analysed.	2.9278624090700536
The condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour-free and that no other occult carcinoma is present.	3.6622752834478116
We report on a three month old infant presenting with vaginal bleeding.	2.9208389016352108
Precocious pseudopuberty due to an autonomous ovarian cyst was diagnosed.	3.6242718527491506
Within three months the follicular cyst spontaneously regressed.	3.4388833491435173
Elevated estradiol levels also decreased spontaneously.	3.199924100644212
The purpose of this study was to determine whether 24 hour patch testing with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) could reliably predict skin susceptibility to an irritant when compared with the alkali resistance test (ART), a widely used method employing sodium hydroxide.	3.0288619357731434
After having given informed consent, 40 patients (age range from 20 to 60 years) with an active irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), 40 patients in whom ICD had cleared, as well as 40 healthy volunteers serving as controls were tested.	3.9606998944954874
The skin responses to SLS were assessed both visually and by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as an indicator of stratum corneum integrity.	2.871061039239693
SLS significantly increased the erythema scores and TEWL in patients with healed ICD, and the increase of TEWL was even more pronounced in patients with active ICD.	4.595094521135106
By contrast, a decrease in alkali resistance was found in patients with active ICD only but not in patients with healed ICD.	4.274559448963403
The data obtained indicate that the SLS test, unlike ART, may provide a non-invasive tool predicting a possible constitutional skin susceptibility or indicating a subclinically impaired epidermal barrier function.	3.0957876705199747
However, because of the relatively high interindividual variation, a cut-clear statement concerning the skin susceptibility cannot be made by this test.	3.3066381339608704
On the other hand, the ART seems only to be useful for following and documenting the healing period following ICD.	2.84316097890415
Introduction: The correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of photoablation (PRK), while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy.	4.187641107913441
Experience has shown that cataract surgery, using modern tunnel techniques with self-healing incisions, results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing.	3.3897571534762916
An often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication, mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care, is reactive acute cholecystitis.	3.2047884961475477
On account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis.	3.825000260850707
Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively, seven times on different days, in each of 40 artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of 12 months.	3.0594076211614003
The results show that artificial respiration, parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to tardive (28/40) wallthickening or to a three-layered wall of the gallbladder (9/40).	3.4735906074073393
In 22.5 % of patients (9/40) we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis.	4.114190630558621
In correlation with the clinical signs, cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients.	4.201978596519581
The preoperative ultrasonographic findings and clinical signs of 23 patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively.	3.9343397685848553
We found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in 21 of these 23 patients.	3.3823497881363633
Our study shows that the morphological correlate of a thickened three-layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations, even if there is no underlying cholecystitis.	3.63435548210167
The diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings.	3.6985148863372816
Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk.	4.023516366763723
The purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	3.1675441383668854
Several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone, such as conventional radiography, high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).	4.333058871416834
The highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using HR-MRI.	3.006879382291944
These studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion.	2.9442067259997042
Combining both techniques yields the best results in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	3.976712486088109
Classification of cosmetics, which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents, is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists.	3.9574839468589116
Their definition within the EU and the respective European directives, replacing national laws step by step, will be briefly presented.	2.8764219894634837
The problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be discusssed in detail by examples from clinical practice.	2.69757163105895
Finally, we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing "medicinally" active cosmetics, and in the pharmaceutical industry towards "cosmetically" oriented medicinal products as part of a current "life-style" ideology.	3.1857936664066413
The decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy.	2.937856399707944
Especially in medical expert appraisements the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient.	3.420549373030822
The purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative pathomorphologic shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases.	3.08126538509852
This study reports of 56 patients with rotator cuff tears which were devided in primarily acute, subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness.	3.0077508355214495
We considered the location of the tear, the shape and the size.	3.8565496960807346
Furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon, its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined.	3.319251969697326
The results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not.	3.5485837744796194
The isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is siginificant for the trauma.	3.288819122133648
In comparison with the degenerative study group the tenosynovitis and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study sigificant for traumatic tears.	3.3049760036111904
Health care decision making in incompetent severely ill patients presents many difficult medical, ethical, and legal problems for the physician.	3.123646046921744
At the same time nurses represent the group of medical professionals who have the closest contact with the patient and who have to carry out most of the decisions and instructions.	3.987758579137226
Barber's disease is produced by short hairs that penetrate the interdigital spaces of the hands.	3.4777767941984523
The following chronic inflammatory reaction causes fistulas or sinuses and cysts.	3.0126744982071387
We present the case of a patient with interdigital pilonidal sinuses of all web spaces in both hands.	2.767895015980333
Such an extensive case of this occupational disease has so far not been reported.	3.320146815414392
The treatment of critically ill patients compromises frequently between an adequate fluid resuscitation for maintenance of a sufficient regional perfusion on the one hand and the avoidance of pulmonary edema on the other hand.	3.2347335677304163
The application of the transpulmonary indicator dilution method allows the orientation of fluid therapy by using the parameters 'intrathoracic blood volume' and 'extravascular lung water'.	3.201543243780759
This technique is less invasive than the pulmonary artery catheter since it only needs a 3 or 4 French catheter in the femoral artery.	3.2962135156228305
Additionally, controlling the fluid therapy with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is severely limited in the mechanically ventilated patient.	2.928901366493582
Therefore, the intrathoracic blood volume may be of advantage in the critically care patient in comparison to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to assess the cardiac preload.	3.6865763802364855
Furthermore, the indocyanine clearance adds a valuable parameter to assess liver function when the double indicator technique is used.	2.7604690905350884
Though they share some aspects with body-oriented psychotherapy these relaxation-techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious meditation.	2.930477341705088
Though in details somewhat different, the methodology of these techniques creates a framework, in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited.	3.4973952597773543
However, regular practice of the patients is requiered.	4.1281748771907605
Focussed attention, imagination and new attributions of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects, which may contribute to enhanced internal selfcontrol and selfesteem.	3.2144305161062854
Controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders (e.g.	2.789065762795296
headache, pain, ess.	4.105683779367945
hypertension), as well as anxiety and sleeping disorders.	4.373441934008415
As components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs, there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders (e.g.	3.267269165902683
Relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific-based component in the treatment of psychic, psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders, except psychosis.	4.280440129042834
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in 1873 by Murray.	3.6188248981207196
Major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy; minor criteria include contractures, osteolytic lesions and a positive family history.	3.3149837696869913
A 35-year-old woman suffering from Crohn's disease for 3 years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the dorsa of her hands and feet, as well as on her elbows and wrists.	3.225715341111225
The clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum.	2.9122882903822505
No improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids.	4.7183587259185344
In contrast, treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions.	3.1372244724375653
During a new attack of her Crohn's disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions flared again.	2.901584580658196
The parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and Crohn's disease, as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases, strongly suggest a common etiology.	3.7577673033463266
This hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature.	3.740295446349796
The mammalian brain is capable of a substantial functional reorganization, manifesting on a cortical somatotopical and on a behavioral level.	3.093430604812027
Possible mechanisms are reviewed based on the work by others and ourselves on somatosensory reorganization in humans.	3.541873024635968
Changes in synaptic weights allow for reorganization of sensory processing: On one side, limb amputation will result in a representational "invasion" of the deafferentated cortex from neighboring regions with concomitant perceptual changes.	2.811269154744279
On the other side, sensorimotor training can increase the representational cortical zone of a limb.	2.9432195504696432
Plastic changes can be temporary or persistent.	3.4065613135069035
Modulating factors like pain and certain drugs seem to induce a permissive state in the cortex resulting in enhanced reorganization.	3.232373116410247
Thus, specific physical training combined with pharmacoceutical modulation holds promise to improve functional recovery after brain lesions.	3.0462286775470027
There have been some prospective randomized studies which compared primary angioplasty with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).	3.313680500030575
However, a substantial number of patients with AMI who would not have been included in those trials are treated with one of these two therapeutic options.	4.0621083976818335
To describe the proportions, characteristics, and outcome of these patients treated with primary angioplasty or thrombolysis we analyzed the data of the prospective "Maximal Individual Optimized Therapy for Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) trial.	3.6879176517948973
Chronic infectious diseases may run over many months and years, accompanied by only mild clinical signs and often without organ-specific symptoms.	3.276453935240392
People with any kind of immuno deficiency are more frequently affected by chronic infections.	3.356259833060986
History, physical examination, laboratory tests, microbiological tests and imaging methods may lead to an exact diagnosis.	3.661084441307551
The most important differential diagnosis are autoimmune diseases, amyloidosis and malignant lymphoma.	2.8271748750811097
Background: We perform partial sphincterectomy during cataract surgery in cases with very small pupil (< 3 mm).	3.552130677200455
We assume that the small pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the sphincter muscle.	3.3609891155695095
Trauma scores in emergency medicine quantitatively characterise the severity of trauma victims' injuries and physiologic derangements.	3.766722908781931
They are used to detect and assess patients and have applications in guiding patient care and early therapeutic decisions.	3.5197665284513557
In the pre-clinical setting, an effective trauma index meets the following criteria: - It is highly reliable with regard to identifying high- and low-risk patients.	3.402073724884063
- It has high face-validity.	2.8533873486371757
- It has high inter- and intra-rater reliability.	3.008501100709239
- It is easy to use and allows rapid, accurate measurements.	3.3944867377858925
The most widely accepted injury severity index is probably the Injury Severity Score (ISS).	3.1472758707463147
It is calculated as the sum of the squares of the three most severely injured body regions, and was originally developed as a means to standardise the description of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents.	3.1179583869668437
The Trauma Score (TS) represents the gold standard of physiologic scoring of injury severity.	3.312090414838826
It summarises the numerical assessments of the central nervous and cardiopulmonary system functions.	3.3708831966340895
The recently developed Mainz Emergency Evaluation Score (MEES) is based upon numerical specification of the vital signs, including a pain scale, and has been designed as a dynamic score.	3.2786666052998474
Nevertheless, limitations of the established trauma score systems have been described.	3.5229113572247757
Mortality and patient outcome do not strictly correlate with injury severity scoring.	3.122330234865927
In addition, intubated or paralysed patients were excluded from outcome studies since the scoring systems lacked options for evaluation of pathophysiological conditions after therapeutic interventions.	2.8427632632286413
Thus, therapeutic efficacy could hardly be assessed, and subsequent scoring during time periods was impossible.	3.0200549152298164
The accurate definition of comprehensive evaluation of a trauma victim is challenging, for example, "pain" as chosen in the MEES must be regarded as a highly desirable piece of information although its rating may prove difficult, especially when classifying unconscious patients.	3.141026296315739
Further criticisms of the above-mentioned trauma indices could include omission of the trauma victim's age, gender, pre-injury health status, or the influence of alcohol or additional medication.	3.691972915175241
Moreover, questioning the interrater reliability of injury severity scoring, a recent study revealed bias in assigning values to trauma patients: trained raters classified injury severity with significantly higher indices than less experienced researchers.	2.752742683286593
If trauma indices in pre-hospital emergency medicine were relied upon as the only means of evaluating a trauma patient and guiding therapeutic approaches, significant numbers of trauma victims requiring major interventions would be missed.	3.283717778391298
Resuscitative treatment regimens must not be based solely upon indices, since, e.g., in states of shock injury scores do not correlate with fluid resuscitative requirements.	3.184801778389224
Furthermore, a qualitative assignment of single vital-function parameters as crucial indices for a patient's condition never reflects the broad range of a patient's profile.	2.971435513342951
Many multiple-trauma patients do benefit from controlled ventilation in clinical experience even though pulse oximetry values are within the physiological range, and the administration of analgesics or even pre-hospital anaesthesia has often proved advantageous for trauma patients in the field.	3.9764214297243647
Providing the opportunity of subsequent patient evaluation and the efficacy of acute care, the MEES has been developed as a dynamic scoring system.	4.0851293873026995
This design is extremely desirable and must be regarded as an indispensible criterion for future scoring systems.	3.3416307076499825
In view of the peculiarities of field emergency medicine, pre-hospital indices do have limitations.	2.9862666177509265
The parameters "unknown patient", time pressure, unprecise measurements, lack of diagnostic facilities, incomplete evaluation, and limited statistical power cannot be eliminated.	3.030965545914521
Accurate prediction of outcome within early time-frames is therefore not possible.	3.0759617209888135
Ossification of the Achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic, hypoxic injury of the tendon.	4.329159987120759
The usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma.	4.45073028430203
We report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the Achilles tendon.	3.924810791362506
Because of the radiologically "occult" fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by MRI.	3.174434375788034
With a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery.	3.6922566558930363
Hair problems are attacked at the levels of information supply, trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment.	3.017748647639665
The alopecias represent a major health care challenge, and the psychological significance of hair loss has only recently found appreciation in the medical community.	3.806426894637417
They may pose a vexing problem for non-specialized physicians, who tend to trivialize such complaints, although the patient's perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought.	3.07509408673808
Perception of a hair problem is subject to sociocultural standards; films and advertisements help determine the threshold for "normality" and what is "healthy" and "beautiful", and the media provide an abundance of undiscriminating information with respect to hair care.	3.332298925150805
Thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser's training qualifications.	3.0520922698872694
Besides manual, creative and psychological aptitudes, "trichological competence" relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders, recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required.	3.0794658897993825
To optimize the interaction between the physician, hairdressers and the media, more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable, with success depending on full identification of the set goals, qualification and adherance to the standards determined by the medical speciality.	3.1788945911765922
We reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy.	3.1230902635461195
Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was SCLC before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two.	4.739284509567252
Two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small-cell and adenocarcinomatous components, and five had only adenocarcinoma.	3.45673575427412
The interval between histological evidence of SCLC and adenocarcinoma was 3 months-5 years.	3.145930865666413
From the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in SCLC after chemotherapy: (a) a primarily heterogeneously differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy, and (b) an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of SCLC, as patients with treated SCLC are known to have an increased risk of non-SCLC.	3.5444070581954152
However, therapy-induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely.	3.159278757653797
These findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of SCLC to allow early and appropriate reaction to non-SCLC components.	3.7312646051347422
Demonstration of BDV-specific serum antibodies, the isolation of BDV from cerebrospinal fluid of neuropsychiatric patients, and the recent demonstration of BDV antigen and BDV-RNA in human brain tissue strongly suggest that BDV can infect humans.	3.367408800677473
Isolation of BD virus from brain tissue is needed for final proof.	3.3554013102493823
There is still great controversy about the question of whether BDV antigen, BDV-RNA or BDV can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes or not.	3.278972552282676
Overall, the question of pathogenicity of BDV infection for humans is wide open.	3.205370795674491
Investigations of human cerebrospinal fluid indicate that BDV might cause human lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and so-called symptomatic psychoses in rare cases.	2.9467351807382753
Seroepidemiological studies suggest a widely non-specific but possibly pathogenic role of BDV in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders.	3.640687216454313
In a controlled prospective study we compared the efficacy of combined salt water bath and UVA/B phototherapy to a UVA/B mono-phototherapy in patients with subacute atopic dermatitis (AD).	3.088398759003642
The patients in the balneophototherapy group (n=16) were treated with baths containing 3-5% of the synthetic salt Psori-sal, followed immediately by UVA/B irradiation, while the other treatment arm (n=12) received UVA/B phototherapy alone.	3.699325582585443
After 20 treatments the balneophototherapy group showed a statistically significant (p<=0.0015) reduction of the SCORAD score from 69.5 before to 36.8 after therapy.	3.456157342283536
No statistically significant reduction in the SCORAD score could be observed in the UVA/B phototherapy group (50.6 before to 44.3 after therapy).	3.5391736744106055
The cumulative UVB dose was significantly lower in the balneophototherapy group (0.9 J/cm2) as compared to the UVA/B monotherapy group (2.0 J/cm2).	3.5032427419919947
Balneophototherapy was well tolerated by patients with atopic dermatitis and no side effects were observed.	3.6073132601581652
We conclude that balneophototherapy expands the therapeutic options for patients with subacute atopic dermatitis.	3.415530075543054
Five percent of all human tumors are found in the head and neck region with an increasing rate.	3.7928448834297117
Head and neck tumors are not only a significant problem because of the large number of people affected.	5.461562439994028
The functional and cosmetic disadvantages and stigmas related to the therapy influence the medical recommendations for each individual patient.	3.402763601386558
Background and purpose: Only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt-PA for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been published.	3.7737318806157667
Wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown, because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in stroke (ECASS and NINDS) did not formally assess the status of the extracranial vessels.	3.9828612538887125
Introduction: Chronic pain is an individually variable experience, incorporating physical, psychological and social dimensions.	3.3313323345612864
Chronic pain occurs in a broad spectrum of severity; therefore, a grading procedure is of crucial importance in clinical research and in epidemiologic studies.	3.516795571940078
The traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions (Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs lesion, overstretching of the capsule), which are caused at the time of primary dislocation.	4.045746457485398
The quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the Bankart lesion.	3.959924632882222
The stronger the capsule, the greater the external force has to be in order to surmount the resistance caused by the capsule.	4.632553647397043
The damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule.	3.5581862425358586
In cases of atraumatic instability, secondary lesions are normally absent.	2.85337782335252
These instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule.	3.112485701039676
When stabilizing, a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration: stability and function.	3.5601500469446927
Reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability.	3.5920785691102926
Additionally, the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted.	3.278882835477551
Both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation.	3.61969351546792
In benign goiter, thyroidectomy is only indicated in patients with nodular alterations of the complete thyroid gland.	3.6904724151822297
There is no evidence indicating that total thyroidectomy could improve the postoperative results in patients with Graves' disease.	3.600860354762001
In Germany, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure for all differentiated thyroid carcinomas.	3.3419359887474753
However, there are no data to prove that this approach is superior to less radical procedures.	3.4306951972846136
Avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative radioiodine therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy.	3.0243940012557844
In patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected ret-proto-oncogene mutations, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation.	2.786016371690532
The cervicolateral and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas.	3.6933110652048526
In patients with medullary carcinomas, persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure.	3.0464759443247913
Thyroidectomy is an important part of the multimodal approach in patients with anaplastic carcinomas.	5.162709171972258
The operative technique of thyroidectomy is presented as well as the technique of cervical lymphadenectomy in consideration of the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland.	3.9680240388002477
Typical clinical features include liver and kidney failure as well as central nervous system involvement.	4.199022045588961
There are three main forms of the disease: the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age.	3.2348698800940214
Experimental data and clinical as well as postmortem experiences have indicated that subdural hematomas are less frequent in acceleration injuries in traffic accidents compared to falls or assaults.	3.562292400409454
The present report demonstrates that this does not hold true in the same way for bridging vein ruptures (one of the predominant causes for subdural bleedings).	3.360004044806699
Ruptures of these vessels without subdural bleeding (SDB) are only seldom mentioned in the literature.	2.9620919085634876
However, if no SDB is present, no one will look for these structures.	3.1698132642526518
In our institute a systematic analysis of the bridging veins in all cases of lethal blunt head injury is made: prior to the careful morphological preparation we investigate these vessels by radiographic imaging after filling with contrast medium.	3.3042756893026723
6 car passengers (age between 4 and 31 years) which suffered a lethal head injury were examined in the last year.	3.8035060582995306
2 victims had impressed fractures with cerebral compression injuries.	3.1757995985493435
In 1 case the base of the skull was broken and in 3 cases no skull fracture was present; no serious focal brain injury had occured in these 4 cases, but 3 victims had signs of diffuse brain injury.	3.46390385661685
In 5 cases a direct impact of the head against the interior of the car was obvious.	3.465420026539578
In 5 cases ruptures of serveral bridging veins could be demonstrated.	2.6808694885816355
In one case (survival for 3 days) a minor SDB (20 ml) was present and the ruptures had been closed by thrombosis; another victim died at the scene.	3.2171553208990242
The other 3 victims survived between 4 and 15 hours without developing SDB and without closing of the ruptures by thrombosis.	2.9415496955030664
This combination is surprising and shows that our knowledge concerning the relationship between bridging vein ruptures and SDB is restrictred.	3.322650524858404
The frequency of bridging vein lesions in severe head injuries is likely underestimated in the clinical as well as in the postmortem literature.	3.697737643480516
A rapid increase of intracranial pressure after the accident resulting in a collapse of the cerebral circulation is probably responsible for the absence of the SDB in the presented cases.	4.039797796284687
Implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear, provided they are fully implantable.	3.312754688018524
Accordingly, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, combined project was initiated at the ENT clinic of the University of Tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids.	3.157365440414583
A novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described.	3.4752050698794124
Unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far, this transducer does not rely on the bimorphic principle but on a circle-shaped, heteromorphic combination system consisting of a piezoceramic disc and metal membrane.	2.7962036376588055
Transfer of mechanical oscillations to an ossicle in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements.	3.1353567309759414
The transducer is highly tuned with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range (greater than 10 kHz).	3.2201989709984526
Below this resonance and down to low frequencies, the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around 20 nm.	3.142158679582763
At low and middle frequencies of up to 1 kHz, these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound-pressure levels of around 90 dB SPL.	3.1257103991072372
At higher frequencies of up to 10 kHz, the output level increases to about 130 dB SPL.	3.5194646490884747
Nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels (less than 0.1%) throughout the whole transfer range.	3.325049782391791
Electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few microwatts and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems.	3.844566982351798
Particularly, this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss.	3.0798797000722384
In craniomaxillofacial traumatology, surgical oncology and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction, a surgeon's aim may interfere with the prechiasmatic visual pathway.	2.994859315222538
Precise concepts and therapeutic strategies are mandatory to detect and deal with anterior visual pathway disorders.	3.6500690574361108
In order to develop these strategies, knowledge of the pathomechanisms of potential optic nerve trauma, primary radiological investigations, and further diagnostic measures are important.	3.4714425139342167
Due to the difficulties in neuroophthalmological testing of visual pathway functioning in severely injured patients or even during craniomaxillofacial reconstructions, we established flash-evoked visual potentials (VEP) and the electroretinogram (ERG) as reliable electrophysiological methods to gather specific information as to whether the visual pathway function is intact, even if pathological, but still present or absent.	3.035522267824586
Case reports show that subjectively or objectively confirmed unilateral amaurosis does not neccessarily mean irreversible vision loss.	2.6425119605446055
The electrophysiological evaluation together with multiplanar computer tomography (CT) are important for the immediate identification of optic nerve trauma.	3.4961110194263134
The results of this evaluation will provide the diagnostic information on whether surgical intervention and/or conservative therapy is required to prevent secondary optic nerve damage.	3.6256210386147556
The conservative therapy of choice for the treatment of traumatic optic nerve lesions is the methylprednisolone-megadosis regimen (30 mg Urbason/kg bodyweight i.v.	3.4562290325057274
and 5.4 mg/kg bodyweight/h i.v.	3.4706304369614007
for the following 47 h).	3.4897073297036894
Surgical therapy involves decompression of the orbital compartment in case of retrobulbar hematoma or decompression of the intracanalicular part of the optic nerve in the traumatized optic canal or posterior orbit as confirmed by CT.	3.4608230406070213
Prospective analysis of our trauma patients and the international literature on traumatic optic nerve lesions show that the time factor in when to start therapy has been greatly underestimated.	4.029482461086759
To fulfill modern treatment concepts in craniomaxillofacial surgery, sound diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge on the maintenance of visual pathway function is required.	3.573800647992873
In the presence of preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes, and preterm maturation of the cervix, there is an increased risk for premature birth.	3.9306396617762855
There is a combination of endocrine as well as paracrine regulations which are responsible for the events associated with preterm labor, maturation of the cervix, and preterm rupture of the membranes.	3.8014152853155774
Apart from classical hormones, various pro-inflammatory cytokines act as mediators.	3.138447490804932
At the fetal-maternal interface - which is formed by the placenta with the chorioamnion on the fetal side and the decidua, myometrium, and the cervix on the maternal side - an intense interaction between endocrine and immunological reactions has been observed.	3.1209356097529444
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone with multiple functions in humans, produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by -adrenergic receptors.	3.559771436725209
Serum melatonin levels exhibit a circadian rhythm with low levels during the day, rise in the evening and maximum levels at night between 2 and 4 a.m.. Melatonin participates in the regulation of several physiological processes such as seasonal biological rhythm, daily sleep induction, aging and modulation of immunobiological defence reactions.	2.9809278307059084
Melatonin seems to quench mainly hydroxyl radicals, the most damaging of all free radicals.	3.2748278628385243
Melatonin may play a role in the etiology and treatment of several dermatoses e.g.	3.8981231414452235
atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.	3.646500030450147
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.	2.9132626650902815
Topical application of melatonin inhibits the development of UV-erythema.	4.021091414943941
Penetration through skin after topical application and oral bioavailability auxit further investigations on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of melatonin.	2.914296658623695
Lung dust analyses were performed on tumor-free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors.	3.5620685270976393
The measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients' occupation as stone mason.	3.728952449874648
No evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found.	4.347856421976053
Analysis of 147 repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the Department of Surgery at the Herz-Jesu Krankenhaus, Fulda, from 1990 to 1995, showed that meniscal lesions were the most common (n = 89, 60.5%).	3.5734192696834035
The majority of meniscal lesions (n = 45, 50.6%) occurred in menisci that had already been partially resected.	3.0500833750715852
The most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions.	3.4051217987100038
Conversely, contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in 18 cases (20.2%), while de-novo lesions occurred in 29 cases (29.2%).	3.0911441855127557
A coincidence of meniscal injury with first- or second-grade cartilage damage was documented  in 35 patients (39.3%), whereas 54 patients (60.7%) had normal intra-articular cartilage.	3.346655260020079
Cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy.	4.250898292339926
The most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage-shaving.	2.880365987569219
Concerning patients' postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by OAK score, the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function (65.2%) and showed good or excellent outcome in the OAK score (88.8%).	3.9347192807749627
Patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area (p < 0.05).	3.4352584121367085
In conclusion, in patients with positive meniscal signs and a history of previous meniscal surgery, repeat arthroscopy is generally and early indicated and can be recommended as a valid method to assess cartilage damage objectively.	3.746346026594361
However, patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit.	3.555186950965568
The present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease-specific stress of eighty-six patients with psoriasis and fifty-eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the PsoriSol Clinic, Hersbruck, Germany.	3.240648260205482
In addition to receiving instruction about their stain disease, the patients were offered, practice in relaxation techniques, social contacts and scratching control as well as individual psychological counselling.	3.5018889852083017
The clinical change was assessed by PASI and SCORAD, respectively.	3.16665332973142
The Marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases (MHF) and a questionnaire for health-related control attributes (GKÜ-S) served as psychometric measures.	3.2992590807129814
Patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre-post comparison.	3.577690247718935
Social fears, avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups.	3.42041240376495
Dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	4.14141121939474
Treatment of chronic cancer pain with strong opioids is indicated in about 60-70 % of patients.	3.7096842057037933
Surprisingly, these very potent analgesics are prescribed with great reservations in many countries, including Germany.	3.0045922375331378
The aim of our investigation was to analyse the supply of opioid analgesics to outpatients with cancer pain in the region of Hannover, which has about 1.1 million inhabitants.	3.6264217333174806
In Germany special prescription forms, i. e. triplicate forms, have to be used for the prescription of strong opioids.	4.011674509594863
At the time when our investigation took place prescriptions for outpatients had to be renewed every 7 days.	3.0229445891142817
For two observation periods of 6 months lasting from January to June 1988 and from January to June 1991 all of the opioid prescription forms that had been issued by general practitioners for clients of the AOK Hannover (one of the major medical insurance companies) were evaluated.	3.4604443648162966
The reasons for prescribing opioids were analysed by recording the diagnosis.	3.285007370596967
The individual treatment period on an outpatient basis during these 6 months was determined, excluding, e. g. days of hospitalization.	3.5716053456610775
The majority of the practitioners consisted of general practitioners and specialists in internal medicine.	2.871941214556313
Although these two groups mainly function as family doctors who are responsible for the basic therapeutical needs of their patients, only 22.6-33.8 % of these doctors prescribed opioids to outpatients.	3.293608641146439
In two-thirds of the patients, cancer pain was the reason for prescribing the drug.	3.4612369939779275
The total number of patients with a prescription for cancer pain was 164 in 1988 and 196 in 1991.	3.632048140387505
Altogether 1002 prescription forms in 1988 and 1065 prescription forms in 1991 had been issued for these patients.	3.2371953046803283
Applied to the individual treatment period as an outpatient, only 36.0 % of the patients in 1988 and 32.1 % in 1991 received a regular prescription of strong opioids every 7 days.	3.7139595094550772
The mean time interval between separate prescriptions was 16.8  +/-  25.4 days in 1988 and 19.4  +/-  29.1 days in 1991.	2.7993863005926793
Accordingly, the majority of patients with chronic cancer pain had been supplied with opioids only occasionally.	3.6053423434912863
Our data indicate a significant undertreatment of outpatients suffering from cancer pain.	2.8106897380521554
Taking into account the estimated total number of patients suffering from cancer, only 14.5 % (1988) and 19.0 % (1991) of all outpatients in need of strong opioids were supplied sufficiently with those analgesics.	3.350149850272307
Comparing the results from the observation period in 1988 with the results from 1991 it becomes obvious that the situation has not changed.	3.910104326358281
There are different reasons for the insufficiency of opioid treatment: many physicians as well as their patients are still afraid of the side effects of strong opioids.	3.6758745090411358
Therefore, it is necessary to improve education concerning this issue.	2.9761325295190257
The legal restrictions on the use of narcotics and their complexity are another important reason for doctors not to prescribe strong opioids.	3.1683261453331446
In 1993 the regulations were simplified; nevertheless, this has not led to a profound change in the attitude of the prescribing practitioners.	3.4373198256278776
Thus, further changes in legislation seem to be necessary so that the requirements for the prescription of strong opioids do not differ from other drugs.	3.3399977580662887
The long-term functional results of acetabular fractures are assessed in terms of the corresponding criteria of Merle-D'Aubigné and Postel (pain, mobility, walking).	3.5241024933129834
Other essential criteria include the quality of reduction and the radiological appearance.	4.376215670843067
A 53 year old female patient developed a keratoacanthoma, present on the left side of her nose for two months.	3.900012974770262
After repeated unsuccessful trials with cryotherapy, she was treated with intralesional injection of methotrexate performed twice with a weekly internal.	3.14663976585528
This led to complete resolution within 5 weeks.	3.217588826365469
Although controlled studies on the effect of methotrexate in keratoacanthoma are not available, the rapid regression and the good cosmetic result suggest that this therapy may play a beneficial role in treating these lesions especially in problem locations.	3.7926440530959664
Between January 1995 and June 1996, 24 inpatients at our hospital (mean age 55.6 years) were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).	3.352200346107453
Clinical improvement was observed in 80% of the patients, including those without risk factors (NRG, n=16), as well as those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases (RG, n=8).	4.309165616398282
During a mean period of observation of 224 days after the end of ECT 7 patients (35%) relapsed.	3.9941247608724266
The rate of relapse was higher in RG than in NRG patients (57.1 vs 23.1%).	2.9244535235425864
In all cases ECT was well tolerated; 285 applications of ECT did not result in mortality or persistent morbidity.	3.0601335748329155
However, RG patients may be at increased risk for the development of minor cardiovascular complications, which were noted in three RG patients (37.5%), but only in one patient (6.2%) in the NRG (Fisher's test, P=0.09).	4.30782098772316
Taken together, our results demonstrate that ECT is a safe treatment regimen for depression even in medically ill patients of old age.	3.565559788154772
On 21.11.1811 the poet Heinrich von Kleist and his companion Henriette Vogel were found dead in a small hollow by the Wannsee.	2.846615643719646
The autopsy revealed that Kleist was shot in the mouth and Vogel died from a close-contact shot to the chest.	2.96914766189819
The tragedy, which was reflected in letters and documents ended in a suicide pact.	3.400566638938948
The conclusions of the pathologists were influenced by current medical opinions which were based on interpretations of the ancient humoral doctrine of Hypocrates.	2.8209919196012034
Subjective and objective opinions were mixed together.	3.26145391257108
Some forensic and historical aspects of this suicide pact are highlighted.	3.3118126303768687
Due to this fact, valuable time is often wasted by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another.	2.6003369707555013
The purpose of this study was to analyse all calls received by the different dispatching centers in the city and county area of Mainz with respect to total number, fraction of emergency calls, and specificity.	3.370947892221628
Further, the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number (112) was calculated.	3.0615748257379347
During a 4-month period, all telephone calls were registered and related to day, time, and origin of the call (city or county) and classified as non-urgent or emergency calls, calls appropriate to the dispatching center dialed, emergency calls to be transferred, or unspecific calls.	3.320374095699222
A total of 80 987 calls were received (city area 84.3%, county area 15.7%), most of them directed to the FB of Mainz (33 086).	3.038991699469333
The EMS dispatching center received 31 286 calls, the five GPS-centers 15 256 calls; 1359 emergency calls that were directed to the police or FB needed transfer to the EMS.	2.8759163234785645
During weekdays the EMS and FB received the most calls, with a reduced frequency on Saturdays and Sundays (Table 2).	3.1747796160816555
Nevertheless, the highest total numbers of calls were received on Saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the GPS.	3.128647686966654
The FB had the highest specificity of calls; more than 50% of the calls to the GPS were unspecific (Fig.	3.3893052950521834
Of all calls, 4.37% were classified as emergency calls; two-thirds of these came from the area of Mainz during the daytime.	3.5339770370404935
During off-duty hours of the GPS in the city, 51% of the emergency calls reached the EMS directly; 49% had to be connected by the police or FB.	3.553293462953958
During duty hours of the GPS, the fraction of calls directed to the EMS decreased significantly to 35%.	2.9844058062571657
During duty hours of the GPS centers in the county area, only 14% of the urgent emergency calls reached the EMS dispatcher directly (Fig.	2.6008791305979138
Compared to the multiple-center mode, a hypothetic single dispatching center for all systems would probably be followed by a slight increase in total number of calls due to the fact that the GPS numbers would be answered 24 h a day, but there would be only minimal differences in the total number received on most days; only on Sundays would a decrease be expected.	3.3125774584917993
The EMS area of Mainz, with a total of 13 different telephone numbers for 7 dispatching centers, can be regarded as typical of the German situation.	4.660696535749514
The high number of emergency calls to be transferred (up to 86% under special circumstances) demonstrated that this weak point in the German EMS system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number.	3.320214499802486
This should occur when a Europe-wide three-digit number "112" will be instituted, probably in 1995.	2.8296735493520964
Additionally, the continued existence of 5- or 10-digit telephone numbers for non-urgent calls may be useful for allowing non-verbal differentiation of calls.	3.326902152973798
In any case, all telephone numbers, including the latter calls, have to enter one dispatching center.	3.8090106738789644
The main advantage of a single dispatching center would be avoidance of the time-consuming transfer of emergency calls from one dispatching center to the other.	3.297068234818142
In addition to elevated intraocular pressure, a compromised ocular blood supply has been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (PCOG).	2.8672313242599463
This paper discusses some popular reform proposals and concludes with another proposal which takes into account economic incentives.	2.638904559234901
Especially the gerontological aim of a longer lifetime employment is adressed.	2.9545655961205757
Epidemiologic data suggest that an underlying genetic disposition can be detected in up to 10 % of all colorectal cancer patients and autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is the entity most frequently identified.	3.622198539466169
It was described first by A. Warthin in 1895 in "Family G" and is characterized by a predisposition to an early onset of colorectal cancer and other intestinal or genitourinary tumors.	3.1818575769204176
We report the case of a 61-year-old woman with five different cancers.	2.8119568244241013
Although the strict Amsterdam Criteria were not fulfilled, molecular analysis revealed HNPCC; further genetic testing in the family confirmed that the 36-year-old and so far healthy son had inherited the germline mutation of his affected mother.	3.073522281215643
Genetic testing in clinically suspected HNPCC cases is recommended for patients with colorectal cancer meeting the Amsterdam Criteria.	3.945514605327822
In patients meeting one of Bethesda Criteria 2-7 without meeting the Amsterdam Criteria, germline mutation analysis is recommended only in MSI-positive tumors.	2.8140245866533475
Introduction: The Pura-Vario stent features 2 newly designed "bridging segments" for enhanced longitudinal flexibility, in order to allow easier and safer stent implantation.	2.8830237924834354
The median palatine suture has long been regarded as having the greatest resistance to dilatation of the maxilla.	2.915516478346506
In 1984 Glassman [3] presented a conservative-surgical method of division of the palatineal suture in which only the lateral and anterior support of the maxilla is debilitated surgically.	3.414167659521418
An orthodontic apparatus cemented in place preoperatively is already used intraoperatively for dilatation of the maxilla.	2.810846165717539
In the period from 1991 to 1997, 16 patients with a leptomaxilla and various dysnathic findings have been operated on at our clinic by the method described by Glassman [3].	4.203201120701167
Sometimes the maxilla was dilated intraoperatively using the apparatus cemented in place by the method of Derichsweiler and dilatation was continued postoperatively until the described result was achieved.	3.2793381640030037
After successful dilatation of the maxilla and a stabilizing phase, a mono- or bimaxillary operation was performed.	3.3022429304210226
The use of this method led to the desired result in 15 patients.	3.9197973282036567
Dilatation of the maxilla was objectivized by determining the pre- and postoperative width of the anterior and posterior dental arch using models and X-ray of the occlusal overlay of the maxilla.	3.643426047779687
In one patient who was operated on at the age of 38 years, a fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla occurred unilaterally due to the completed ossification of the median palatine suture.	4.605219527141261
The method of surgically aided dilatation of the maxilla at the level of Le Fort I plane is suitable for patients up to the age of 30.	3.972332762794516
In older patients, the median palatine suture should be transsected as well.	3.725896491359611
Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease.	4.806712900977857
In addition to known risk factors e.g.	2.649372195663069
genetics, age and hormonal status it has been suggested that chronic-repetitive micro- and substantial (macro-) injury may play an important pathogenetic role.	3.3679146160692173
In a longitudinal case-study we examined Judo-players for clinical and radiological changes of the finger joints over the course of 16 years.	3.8358295965493454
We report a case of an arteriovenous fistula of the neck after a penetrating injury.	3.1367967548395677
The only presenting symptoms were a thrill and a machinery murmur.	2.899009253197494
There were no signs of cardiac insufficiency.	2.958949558510803
Duplex scan and arteriography detected an arteriovenous fistula between the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein.	3.6591922511546153
Treatment should be carried out as soon as possible, and is then usually simple and successful.	3.918082673287565
Pathogenesis: Arteriosclerosis and Mönckeberg's disease mediasclerosis are vascular diseases associated with calcification of the artery wall.	3.0597197899806607
While mediasclerosis in most cases develops in type 2 diabetic patients, arteriosclerosis is the result of a combination of different vascular risk factors.	3.9434437987342794
Möncheberg's mediasclerosis typically involves the tunica media, whereas arteriosclerosis-associated calcifications primarily involve the intima.	3.0416732553027064
The new technique of non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) sialography was evaluated for normal and various pathologic conditions of the parotid gland.	3.6256153649758858
Ten volunteers and 15 patients with various symptomatic diseases of the parotid gland were tested in the present study.	4.393422884651315
Diseases included pleomorphic adenoma, cystadenolymphoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, ductal carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, lymphoepithelial carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sialolithiasis, sialadenitis, Heerfordt's syndrome and congenital duct ectasies.	2.886673705162101
In addition to the usually performed T1 and T2 cross-sectional sequences a heavily weighted T2 sequence (TR 3600, TE 800) was performed and allowed depiction of a fluid-filled parotid duct.	2.8425046084919643
Results showed that the main parotid and primary branching ducts were depicted reliably in all normal cases and all patients, except one with sicca syndrome.	3.488289397920217
Pathological conditions such as duct dilatations, duct strictures, obstructing duct calculus and irregular shapes and courses of the ductal system were demonstrable.	2.7193255162966756
While X-ray sialography obtained a higher resolution, only MR sialography was able to depict dilated ducts proximal from a complete obstruction, as well as all ductal cysts.	3.6568247396766176
Our findings show that MR sialography can be applied successfully to investigations of the parotid gland system.	3.34114194160366
There have been no contraindications or complications to date because MR sialography is non-invasive.	3.106977386539251
The technique will also allow the salivary ducts and lesions to be differentiated from the course of the facial nerve.	3.3841033209303006
Substantial improvement in conformal radiotherapy is possible using modulated irradiation fields.	3.135325690818128
Such modulated fields may be generated even with conventional accelerators by means of individual metal compensators or with the recently available dynamic multileaf collimators (MLC).	3.0781699587746583
For treatment planning a new kind of planning program is required that can calculate the 2 D-intensity matrices for each photon field.	3.06783817284374
At the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) such a program has been developed under the name of "KonRad" (Conformal Radiotherapy).	2.947163300149703
Although it is an independent application, it is proposed for clinical usage to supplement a planning system that is already present.	3.7044439713237614
So-called inverse planning differs from conventional 3 D planning, as the trial-and-error approach for finding good field parameters is nearly completely avoided.	3.2255117895037593
Instead, the radio-oncologist is given the chance directly to specify medically oriented criteria like the prescription dose in the target volume, maximal tolerance dose values for each organ at risk and their weighting factors.	3.090516972770718
In addition, the so-called DVH optimization allows aimed, partial overdosage, especially in parallelly structured organs in order to obtain better overall planning results.	3.2646505879797836
The Problem Six-year old boy with unilateral Type-II cleftfoot, oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd toe.	3.317168150628343
The marked splaying of the forefoot not only causes painful pressure points but also problems with fitting of shoes.	2.9696753669531475
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the supernumerary marker refered to chromosome 22.	2.797545198157809
In the literature only a few cases show all the characteristic features of cat eye syndrome.	3.4132828570056404
However, there are only two case reports of children without any ocular alterations.	3.4399773625424617
The great variability in the phenotype probably depends on different sizes of the marker chromosome or asymmetric breakpoints on the long arm of chromosome 22.	2.913277768238973
According to new literature reports there is no correlation between the phenotypic variability and the size of the marker chromosome.	3.6044709354519826
Probably the degree of severity is correlated with the percentage of the patients lymphocytes that contain the extrachromosome.	4.421026423078887
Introduction: Children with ALL frequently present with skeletal pain at the time of diagnosis.	3.065794997990442
We retrospectively analyzed the incidence and clinical features of skeletal pain and the correlation between pain and radiographic findings.	3.830280647845505
Although several groups proved the evidence of a negative inotropic effect, the actual mechanism is not completely understood.	3.685002720723326
Speaking generally it is possible that low molecular weight proteins are capable of altering myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	3.0857120218774123
Therefore this study analyzes whether IL-1 and/or IL-6 influence myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	3.3701130294970087
Methods: During aorto-coronary bypass operation, human muscle fibers were excised (n=32) and skinned using Triton-X-100.	2.963908227515616
The experimental skinned fiber model excludes membrane-related factors such as receptor activation and provides direct examination of the contractile apparatus itself.	3.306253444219201
Different concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 were applied (pIL-1/IL-6 1-2x10-5-10-11M).	3.2459115971279875
Force generation, calcium sensitivity, and velocity of force generation and relaxation were measured.	3.287350025756646
(Experiments were carried out at optimal length, bath temperature 23 °C, and isometric conditions.)	3.2475018482987035
Results: None of the skinned muscle preparations of the human myocardium showed under the given experimental setup a significant change in contractility and relaxation after exposure to IL-1 and IL-6.	3.046872847519582
Despite using nonphysiologic concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 (pIL-1/IL-6 10-5M) no significant effect occurred.	3.0376762444415246
Furthermore no difference in calcium-sensitivity of the contractile proteins following addition of IL-1 and IL-6 could be observed.	3.583441447800795
Conclusions: Thus, there is no experimental evidence for direct modulation of the contractile apparatus by IL-1 or IL-6.	3.7523189257651075
Given these results it is possible to exclude some potentially negative inotropic cascades that are mediated on the level of the contractile apparatus as the molecular mechanism.	3.3764086563268223
These data show that therapies which support myocardial contractility during sepsis by stimulation of the contractile proteins do not seem to be very promising.	3.639217512590194
Indications for intercarpal and radiocarpal resectionarthroplasty and fusions are osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK'S disease, rheumatoid arthritis and several posttraumatic disorders of the wrist joint.	2.9524295345980964
The resection of carpal bones leads to severe instability patterns of the wrist.	3.1279125178939893
In conclusion we recommend resection-arthroplasty just for treatment of the thumb carpo-metacarpal osteoarthritis.	3.4906559362835665
Implant resection arthroplasty of the lunate and scaphoid or total wrist implants are still causing multiple problems regarding heavy load.	3.213263061857883
Therefore this implants should be confined to rheumatoid patients.	3.108544532321522
Of the limited carpal arthrodeses the scaphotrapezium-trapezoid arthrodeses is the most frequent performed procedure.	3.263024304158574
It can be indicated for STT-osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK's disease, scapho-lunate instability and scaphoid pseudarthrosis if other surgical procedures had failed presuming there are no signs of arthrosis in the radiocarpal joint.	3.0357417693263735
Persisting pain especially in heavy work is quite frequent after limited arthrodesis but can be greatly releaved by simultaneous wrist denervation.	2.9477946327795035
Increasing numbers of monitors at the anaesthesiologist's workplace, providing more than 20 different parameters of the patient's condition, have already made it impossible to record all the values in a handwritten form.	3.410389974542226
In recent years computerised data-acquisition systems have been introduced into clinical practice in order to produce more reliable records.	3.9166288752895717
But after a 7-year experience in the use of such a system in cardiac anaesthesia, we have recognised certain problems that remain to be solved before automated record-keeping will achieve wider acceptance.	3.7819441813845196
The first is the handling problem, which was discussed in a previous paper [11].	3.6442058393534644
The second major problem is the appearance of artifacts, caused mainly by mechanical manipulations during the operation.	3.518725832548211
In this paper, 300 courses of anaesthesia that were recorded on-line during different cardiac surgery procedures were examined and the incidence as well as the kind of artifacts occurring were evaluated.	3.4396816794438
Algorithms were developed for each haemodynamic parameter to suppress these artifacts automatically by a subsequent analysing process; the efficiency of that "artifact filter" was validated in 35 of the 300 cases.	3.2265831143168606
Based on more than 30,000 values for each parameter, the incidence of artifacts was 3%-7%.	3.9730576808652858
However, only 0.1%-0.5% of the artifacts could not be eliminated by the filter.	3.3484755068573664
The method described here provided acceptable graphic printouts of the most important haemodynamic parameters (Figs.	3.4371183394577316
1b and 2b) and would also be suitable to serve as an input filter for automatically running anaesthesia data-examination processes, which are currently being developed in our clinic.	3.8255570051262517
Extracorporal shock wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	2.4214543377709377
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of the ESWA on the treatment of soft tissue disorders.	3.1150110302314378
The aim of this study was to explore the effect of high energy extracorporal shock waves in patients with painful calcaneus spurs.	3.4139527749538296
83 patients who underwent medicophysical treatment without benefit were treated with 3000 impulses of 0,30 mJ/mm2.	3.9404528087117296
Follow-ups after 12 weeks and 12 months showed that 51 of 83 patients became pain-free and 20 patients improved from the treatment.	3.641717765255722
The results are showing the benefit of the high energy extracorporal shock wave application in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.	3.937123443105898
In developed countries, medical conditions, rather than lack of food, are the main contributors to malnutrition.	3.486717070200315
Undernutrition is especially common in older persons, occuring in 5-12 % of community-dwelling older persons, in 30-61 % of hospitalized older persons, and in 40-85 % of persons in long-term care institutions.	3.938878134091842
The multi-factorial nature of undernutrition in the elderly forces a structured differential diagnostic approach to determine underlying causes.	3.410949150694413
Heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment is imperative to prevent the sequalae of undernutrition.	3.41354408232304
This structured approach to the differential diagnosis is essential to evaluate potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.	4.447689766247019
The number of surgical procedures performed as day surgery has significantly increased in recent years.	3.18878976370492
Therefore, a safe and short postoperative recovery period has become increasingly important.	3.228339361551591
The aim of the present study was to investigate perioperative cognitive and physiological function after oral premedication with low-dose midazolam (3.75 mg), especially during the postoperative period.	3.007163003463325
Heart failure may be defined as a reduced physical per-formance frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contraction.	3.7843966936401197
According to the New York Heart Association, the severity of heart failure is classified into four grades (NYHA I-IV).	3.1448754778809054
Predominantly underlying causes are coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies and valvular heart diseases.	3.0892121014005864
Psychic disorders were studied with a naturalistic design in 125 consecutive patients of a medical-geriatric department in a general hospital.	3.2893893336010254
Based on the clinical examination and the values of the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (2), 51 patients were classified as unable for diagnostic procedures concerning psychic state.	3.9749429137309136
The other 74 patients underwent these diagnostic procedures including clinical investigation and three screening-scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11); Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Scale (4)).	3.0806323232499655
If these examinations led to the suspicion that a patient suffered from a psychic disorder, an interview was performed by a psychotherapist with experience in gerontopsychosomatic treatment and information was collected from the medical and nursing staff.	3.9051412493267144
Dementia was detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.	3.0788510765509725
Psychic disorders were found in 41 patients, mostly adaptation disorders and depressions, the disorder was estimated to be relevant for the whole hospital therapy.	3.6882261471564157
The screening instruments turned out to be reliable, so they can be recommended for further use.	3.6438913592658073
Difficult to answer remains the question, how the treatment of the psychic disorders - in our sample necessary for each 5th to 6th patient - can be implemented in a medical-geriatric department.	3.932379168276537
Based on the "Trauma Registry" of the German Society of Trauma Surgery, an interclinical quality management (QM) system was implemented.	2.8576127192480523
The principles of the QM system as well as the differences in the quality of outcome and treatment are presented.	4.586786248174418
The analysis uses the data on 2,069 severely injured (ISS = 22  +/-  14) patients from 20 hospitals collected prospectively and anonymously between 2/93 and 12/97.	3.1515276609632417
Outcome quality was analyzed by the TRISS method and Z-statistics.	3.477000593887187
The Z-value of the whole series was -0.24.	3.8040545082075665
There were three hospitals with more than 150 patients that had a Ps value calculated by the TRISS method.	3.2057727416533095
Clinic A had a good (-2.49), clinic B an average (-0.3) and clinic C (3.62) an adverse Z-value.	3.1044528696424285
The assessment of treatment quality was performed by criteria concerning both preclinical and acute clinical phases.	3.2611421524500797
Clinic C had a prolonged preclinical treatment time (90 min vs 62 min in clinic A) for severely injured (ISS > 15) patients.	3.2781195257613542
At the same time, the preclinical intubation rate for severe thoracic trauma (AIS > 3) was lower (44 %) in clinic C than in A (62 %).	3.3620141226087545
With 14 min clinic A had the shortest time until basic radiological and ultrasound diagnostics were completed (X-rays of chest and pelvis and abdominal ultrasound) in cases of severe blunt trauma (ISS > 15), compared to 54 min in clinic B or 31 min in clinic C. Also, cranial computed tomography for severe traumatic brain injury (GCS < 9) was applied significantly faster in clinic A (after 36 min) than in clinic C (after 62 min).	3.368604087593827
Delayed diagnoses were defined as the difference between the ISS at discharge and the ISS at completion of diagnostics in the emergency department; this criterion was met best by clinic A with an ISS difference of two patients compared to five in clinic B and four in clinic C.	3.5929148380974882
For invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media (CM) with excellent tolerability are available.	2.871644679693938
Tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity, osmolality, and ionic concentration.	3.1743949348924985
In Germany the nonionic CM are currently preferred.	2.858805237906604
Because of its low thrombotic complications, the ionic CM Ioxaglat is an important alternative in high risk interventions.	3.5169982469501275
In patients with known CM incompatibility, the prophylactic application of H1-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications.	2.9815068812190044
In impaired renal function, hydration is the most effective prophylactic measure to be taken.	4.172816726412714
Background: In the present study we evaluated the influence of topical miotics on intraocular pressure and the blood-aqueous barrier after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and PC-IOL implantation.	2.993264127132561
Very often there is no correlation between these parameters.	3.9998360636096426
It is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question-naire since non-life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much.	3.8602357175182678
The most frequently used questionnaires are the SF-36 and the Nottingham Health Profile.	2.992848297038612
However, these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately.	2.683749080434095
Therefore specific tools such as the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) and Skindex have been established for dermatology.	3.4564330338966798
Further disease-specific questionnaires have been created to mea-sure time related changes in dermatological patients.	3.288959591013445
We surgically treated twenty patients with axillary hyperhidrosis by liposuction using tumescent regional anesthesia.	2.835993838748202
After a description of the surgical technique results are presented.	4.365174264135534
Except for trivial hematomas, no complications were seen.	3.461076733121708
Every patient noted a significant reduction of sweat gland activity in the follow up period.	3.8117526097989876
Long-term results remain to be seen.	3.4834421498131736
The value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).	3.7274068902808337
Clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38/69 cases (55 %).	4.39732080717243
The chromosome aberrations, especially complex changes, were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as atypias of the haematopoietic cell lines and myelosclerosis.	3.0275835177136377
Complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the MDS patients.	3.252651365837572
Our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in supplementing the histopathological diagnoses.	3.0711234933698863
Recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non-dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis.	3.293445746739065
In the course of 1 year, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and therefore may be very harmful in frail elderly people, was diagnosed in six patients of a geriatric clinic.	3.8204494859413116
The disease is associated with antibiotic therapy, due to an overgrowth of the intestinal flora with Clostridium difficile.	4.180665367363249
Symptoms varied from a state of asymptomatic carriage or benign diarrhea to acute stages of the disease with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and acute phase response.	3.335546595883042
Diagnosis of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea was established when, in addition to typical clinical symptoms, a toxin-positive stool specimen was found.	3.299096121754922
Oral vancomycin was effective in all cases, leading to a stop in the diarrhea and an amelioration of systemic inflammatory parameters.	3.520564574931988
According to recent results, in order to prevent the induction of vancomycin-resistance and in view of higher treatment costs, metronidazole is considered as the drug of choice in mildly and moderately ill patients.	3.713017603714884
This report analyzes 46 cases of personnel-to-patient transmissions of hepatitis B (HB), hepatitis C (HC) and HIV in health care settings.	3.24635883749089
Cases with the highest number of transmissions (one anesthesiologist with 217 HC transmissions, and one EEG technologist with 75 HB transmissions) were attributed to poor infection control practices.	2.981815320145682
As long as infected health care workers (HCW) adhere to general infection control measures, a risk for transmission to patients exists only from infected surgeons who perform'xposure-prone invasive procedures'.	2.756232260584171
Whether changes in duties of infected HCW are necessary should be decided on an individual basis.	3.0121008952592434
Often, the infected personnel were assumed to have acquired the disease occupationally.	3.3206386811308177
Medical practices and devices bearing a risk of infection should constantly be reviewed with regard to risk for patients and personnel.	4.206112003160592
The healthy newborn infant also has the right to optimal monitoring in order to detect any disturbance in postnatal adaptation as early as possible.	3.3636193568480333
Injuries of the spine in children rarely occur.	3.5497946454166844
They amount to about 0.2 % of all fractures and dislocation and to 1.5 to 3 % of all lesions of the spine.	3.9112616644205755
The younger an injured child is, the more likely it has sustained a lesion of the upper cervical spine.	3.838009808214491
This spinal segment in comparison to adults is concerned more often and accounts for 50 % of all C-spine injuries.	3.5718260404948183
Important differences between the adult spine and the spine in the child disappear with the age of 10 years.	4.196478380122653
Later diagnostics, classification and treatment correspond widely with the principles valid in adults.	3.1589573346738744
The knowledge of the normal shape and development of the spine are crucial in avoiding misinterpretations of X-ray films.	4.221621491223551
Typical examples include the confusion of synchondrosis with fractures or of subluxations of the atlas and the C2/C3 segment with "true" instabilities.	2.9347482530315787
Relevant lesions always are accompanied by clear clinical symptoms.	3.1783250723999634
Specific injuries of the growing axial skeleton are lesions of the cartilaginous endplates and "fractures" of the synchondrosis.	3.8753624008087524
Although a variety of histologic entities were described, primary tumors of the trachea are rare findings.	4.060380228530268
Over a period of 20 years, 30 patients underwent 31 tracheal resections in two hospitals for thoracic surgery.	3.024700735143388
Among them 4 patients had thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea.	3.2227868098666645
In these patients a strumectomy combined with tracheal resection was performed.	2.927470412607068
One re-operation for erosion bleeding of the innominate artery on the 8th postoperative day was successfully performed.	3.048820289948994
All patients showed excellent long-term survival.	3.4757867294175817
Principles, methods and results of percutaneous therapy in acute and chronic vascular alterations of the subclavian artery and its branches.	3.7254713548753373
Speculations concerning a possible association between temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and ear symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus have been made in the dental and medical literature for a long time.	3.275359147271312
Current understanding of this association is reviewed.	3.017899629772472
An analysis of relevant studies published between 1947 and 1996 shows that a relatively high percentage of TMD patients reported the presence of ear pain and noise.	3.312179390743781
However, a cause-effect relationship has not been established to date.	3.497843260319987
Theories that try to explain the concurrence of TMD symptoms and ear symptoms (particularly tinnitus) by a common underlying cause remain speculative.	3.236760423370604
It has to be taken into consideration that due to their high prevalence, TMDs and ear symptoms in a given patient may be present by chance alone.	3.7934146620180083
A methodological weakness of most of the studies available is the fact that control groups were not considered.	4.191720682051864
Owing to the lack of prospective, controlled, and randomized studies, statements regarding the effectiveness of certain dental measures for the treatment of otalgia and tinnitus in TMD patients are not well supported.	3.547446024586513
Our report describes a 46-year-old woman with self-inflicted oedema of the left leg and the left arm.	4.181074654907254
She induced leg oedema by an elastic bandage tourniquet and arm oedema by holding her arm dependent and immobile.	2.8105759013256892
A preexisting disorder of the affected leg (postthrombotic syndrome) and of the affected arm (hypoesthesia subsequent to surgical injury of the plexus brachialis) delayed the diagnostic proceedings.	3.924025062837564
Our case report shows that: -  Confirmed presence of organic disease does not exclude limb oedema of self-inflicted origin.	3.011316448804209
-  Oedema resulting from a tourniquet and "hysterical oedema" can be developed by one and the same patient.	3.2428801566739436
Purpose: This study was conducted to control improvement in the high preoperative prevalence of TMJ symptoms in patients treated by long-term orthodontic therapy for class II malocclusion.	4.3516703571891675
Patients and methods: A total of 57 patients were examined at least 8 years after surgery, 37 having received orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery and 20 surgery but without orthodontic treatment.	3.527432078172499
Myofunctional, disk and condylar symptoms were recorded according to the Krough-Poulsen scheme.	3.4701332488995096
Results: Both groups showed a normal maximal interincisal distance.	3.4036632211233697
The deviation during the opening movement was mainly sigmoidal in the group with orthodontic treatment and terminal in the other group.	3.460262464540199
Clicking sounds of the TMJ were registered in 70% of both groups.	3.709485177078777
Occlusal interference and a higher interocclusal distance when speaking were found more often in patients without orthodontic treatment.	3.532034586389651
Preoperatively, clicking and crepitation sounds had been recorded in 60% of both patients groups.	3.083350826997924
Conclusion: In conclusion, a high postoperative prevalence of TMJ dysfunction symptoms was found in patients with class II malocclusion 8-10 years after orthognathic surgery with or without orthodontic treatment.	4.323225090829422
The synthesis of pS 2 protein is induced through estrogen-dependent transcription of the pS 2 gene.	2.932517154438529
The presence of the pS 2 protein in breast cancer is thought to be as valuable as receptor status, or even more so, in predicting the response to hormonal therapy.	3.3597298029150204
Furthermore, pS 2 appears to be a prognostic factor for primary breast cancer.	3.625567669319009
In 162 cases of primary breast cancer, pS 2 was tested by immunohistochemical procedures on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues.	3.146327343755093
Staining was evaluated semiquantitatively using an immunoreactive score (IRS).	3.3085165991543937
The concentrations of pS 2 in tumor cytosol were determined using an immunoradiometric assay.	3.1635879429813194
Positive staining for pS 2 (IRS >= 2) was seen in 27 % of the tumors.	3.622059802317254
Comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection (26 % of tumors had pS 2 cytosol concentrations above the cut-off value of 26 ng/mg cell protein) revealed an 81 % concordance rate (r = 0.76; P < 0.0001).	2.823250161295729
Univariate analysis showed no significant correlation of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection and age or menopausal status of patients, tumor size, tumor grade or nodal status.	3.68117642569591
However, the immunohistochemical pS 2 status correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen (ER; P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor status (PR; P < 0.0001).	3.023746049943886
pS 2-positive tumors were ER-positive in 66 % of cases and PR-positive in 73 %; 89 % of pS 2-positive tumors were positive for ER and/or PR.	3.502437945484502
The incidence of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection was 41 % in the group of steroid receptor positive carcinomas (ER- and/or PR-positive) in contrast to 7 % in steroid receptor negative tumors (ER- and PR-negative).	3.2866931910364348
Patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting may develop acute myocardial infarction late after surgery.	3.313218301140583
It is not exactly known in these patients whether acute infarction is predominantly caused by occlusion of bypass or native vessels.	3.159747370703602
Also, there is no systematic and prospective data available with respect to an invasive, revascularizing therapeutic approach.	3.8819855116437507
Therefore, acute coronary angiograms were obtained in 21 consecutive patients with acute infarctions and remote bypass grafting to elucidate mechanisms causing myocardial infarction in these patients, and to assess results of catheter-based recanalization.	4.437857835853104
We report the clinical and laboratory results of a family where one boy and one girl presented with a clinical picture resembling the X-linked agammaglobulinemia known as Bruton's disease.	3.832150459027842
Both children showed severe bacterial infections starting at the age of around 6 months, a lack of all immunoglobulin classes and absence of mature B-cells in the peripheral blood.	3.7872840647098642
With respect to reports from the literature these results are yet another indicator for the existence of an autosomal-recessiv disorder with the same clinical make-up as Bruton's disease.	3.3013235811607196
A deletion on chromosome 14 leading to the disorder was identified.	3.6858322150367337
Conservative treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence in females gained more and more interest.	3.3287444261071446
The use of mini-devices is one of the newly developed therapeutical options however, its clinical relevance and longterm-results are still under debate.	3.3140806848038418
This review article gives a critical evaluation of the available urethral plugs and regulators and new developments as well according to the longterm-follow-up studies in the literature and own experience with those devices.	4.36304230674414
The continence rates that can be obtained with the different plugs or regulators are dependent upon the degree of stress incontinence, ability to insert the plug and compliance of the patient.	3.7516450790436227
Reported longterm results vary between 48 % and 100 %.	3.300386137794739
The most frequent side effects are urinary infection, haematuria and/or handling problems with the devices.	3.4966843182460114
According to the published material it is impossible to give therapeutical standards for treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with urethral mini-devices.	3.164654803808783
Although proper Patient selection might give excellent longterm-results in patient continence rates.	3.0721568850739254
Currently two techniques are available: the photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) and the combination of arcuate keratotomies with standard PRK (PRK-T).	3.2727972527751934
Although there are randomized data for CABG vs. medical therapy and CABG vs. PTCA in primary therapy of CAD, there is few evidence on the appropriate therapy of recurrent angina after prior CABG.	3.168597675031109
We analyzed data from 1265 consecutive patients (PTS.)	3.487156904012973
presenting for recurrent angina after previous CABG who required either re-CABG (n=67), PTCA (n=768) or medical therapy alone (medRx) (n=430) at our institution during 1986 through 1996.	3.1512329472425242
Outcome after index therapy is monitored during 45  +/-  34 months.	3.1502303435654784
The 3 therapeutic groups were similar with respect to gender (84 % male), age at therapy (60 years), prevalence of diabetes (22 %), and time to first ischemic event after primary CABG (37 months).	3.876093713364844
Actuarial survival was significantly higher in the PTCA-group at 1, 5 and 10 years after therapy of recurrent angina, despite the freedom from subsequent re-intervention was significantly lower (1-year-survival 95 % [37 %] vs. 95 % [3] medRx vs. 79 % [4 %] re-CABG, 5-year-survival 87 % [57 %] vs 78 % [17 %] medRx vs. 50 % [4 %] re-CABG and 10-year-survival 72 % [65 %] vs. 63 % [31 %] medRx vs. 50 % [15 %] re-CABG resp., p < 0.0001, [numbers in brackets represent corresponding values for incidence of re-intervention, p < 0.0001]).	3.5572752604640363
These findings were similar after adjustment for different baseline characteristics.	2.940311285545955
Due to advances in surgical methods, such as miniplate and lag screw osteosynthesis, there is current discussion about the adequate therapy of condylar fractures.	3.8873604760210223
Regarding the insufficient outcome of conservative treatment confirmed by refined methods of functional diagnosis, there is a trend towards surgical therapy, at least in cases of condylar displacement out of the fossa.	4.150316961675393
This trend was also prompted when surgeons learned that the condyle determines local growth but does not serve as a growth center of the mandible.	3.2515800663240637
Along with increased interest in temporomandibular function and surgical therapy of internal disorders, surgical therapy of traumatic soft tissue lesions was emphasized.	3.5204324744383544
Conservative treatment will nonetheless be sufficient in cases of minor displacement due to a higher ability of remodeling, even more so in children.	3.894428994865836
A case of a 37-year-old woman with symmetrical bilateral apocrine hidrocystomas at the lateral margins of the eyelids is presented.	3.3821815688484222
The symmetrical, simultaneous and bilateral appearance of the lesions, the lack of association with other abnormalities and the absence of the lesion in the family history make this case remarkable.	4.532312953511764
The situation of intensive care units (ICU) in Germany was analyzed by a national survey.	4.337072444273036
The personality organisation and the process of therapy of drug-addicted patients are examined by the comparative analysis of 15 single cases.	3.622493175840427
The antisocial tendency is emphasised as the main clinical feature.	3.4326823693776167
It is related to specific genetic traumata and the externalisation of parts of the superego.	3.087275210982359
During the therapeutical process, the antisocial tendency destroys the therapeutical relation.	3.0381487199071215
If it is possible to continue therapy beyond this point, the patients can now enter into a process, in which new identifications and the integration of parts of the superego are involved.	3.6838232829979156
Approaching the end of the therapy, patients, again, tend to destroy the results of therapy if one does not consider specific problems of the separation process.	4.023464058464553
Objective: The Uppsala-definition of leukoplakia has recently redefined oral leukoplakia.	2.853603739973272
Based on this definition, the aim of our study was to reevaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with histologically proven primary oral cancer.	3.8897717205099247
Design: A total of 101 inpatients in four tumor centers in Berlin were interviewed and clinically examined just prior to surgery of an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).	3.6623424450161544
Results: The prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15.8%.	3.5777961599285426
Additional leukoplakias without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4% of the patients.	4.744493563949365
There were no significant differences in age- or sex-distribution, history of tobacco habits or diet  between patients with or without leukoplakia.	3.1976878734155605
T1 carcinomas were found in 62.5% of patients with, and 24.4% of patients without associated leukoplakia, whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre-operative staging of the tumor.	4.416317771092529
Conclusions: The prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with OSCC was low, compared to retrospective studies.	3.852654720445206
The presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor, except of tumor size.	3.519038725685387
The results emphasize that most OSCC develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa.	2.843909847512882
Cutaneous angiosarcomas mainly arise on the scalp and face of older patients.	3.299807100539679
They present with reddish nodules or plaques and tend to bleed and ulcerate.	2.8149374774483746
Angiosarcomas show an aggressive and recurrent course and have a high potential for metastasis.	3.862244429413173
We report on a 48-year-old patient with unilateral eyelid edema as the first manifestation of an angiosarcoma.	3.258773083496182
The clinical presentation, the history of contact allergy, the presence of antinuclear antibodies, and abnormal thyroid function tests favoured a non-neoplastic disease.	3.7886856703120513
However, multiple biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of a highly differentiated angiosarcoma.	4.266299476156157
Staging of the patient revealed no metastasis.	4.446371344076343
After radical surgery including orbital exenteration and postoperative radiation therapy, no recurrence was observed with a follow up of 26 months.	3.5300895628038043
This case underlines the importance of including angiosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of unilateral eyelid edema.	3.2865147663328207
The Marburg Cardiomyopathy Study (MACAS) is a prospective observational study designed to determine the value of the following potential non-invasive arrhythmia risk predictors in more than 200 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) over a 5-year-follow-up period: New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation on ECG, QTc and JTc-dispersion on 12-lead ECG, abnormal time-domain analysis and spectral turbulence analysis of the signal-averaged ECG, ventricular arrhythmias and heart-rate variability on 24-hour Holter ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T wave alternans during exercise.	3.3019370235049506
Abstract   The observation of extremely variable clinical courses for patients with renal cell carcinomas of an identical pathological stage as well as a comparable histological differentiation resp.	3.988807946283794
growth pattern strongly indicates the existence of tumors harboring different biological aggressiveness.	3.414359013397776
Currently available histopathological classification systems do not predict the biological behaviour of renal cell cancer as sufficiently as the establishment of a therapeutical strategy adjusted to the individual patient would require.	3.7083232603348084
The need for a more refined characterization of the biological potential of the indidual tumor results from the introduction of modified operative strategies as organ-preserving surgery, for example, as well as from the recently suggested application of an adjuvant systemic therapy adapted to the individual risk for tumor recurrence resp.	3.684227235852883
the development of progressive disease.	5.0680693042763
In this context, several biological parameters including the identification of alterations on the DNA-, RNA- and protein level have been discussed as possible biological prognostic markers for renal cell cancer.	3.070729720339229
The present review tries to reflect currently available biological characteristics of RCC which might gain clinical importance with regard to an individualized therapy in the near future.	3.2233997776515624
Until now reports of factitious disease have not been found in the ENT literature.	4.208121029046833
In contrast, the dermatologic literature estimates an incidence from 0.01 to 0.26%.	2.7083047539521803
In order to achieve effective treatment for these patients, knowledge of the characteristic symptoms is fundamental.	4.168269318449089
The present paper describes the variety of disease possible, using three cases treated between 1992 and 1994 in the ENT Department of Cologne.	3.2385294734911785
According to the literature, females are involved in a ratio of 9:1, with the majority working in medically related professions.	3.6599457590423374
Depression and anorexia are typical symptoms.	3.2837651003562134
Confrontation of a suspect patient by the otolaryngologist is not often considered because several reports quote suicidal behavior in up to 25% of self-manipulating patients and tendencies to refuse to follow psychiatric treatment are considerable.	3.2504859348965724
Numerous different diseases lead to scarring alopecia with irreversible follicular destruction as a common ending.	3.239800671134597
Current classifications are based on clinical, histopathological or prognostic parameters, as well as on pathogenetic criteria which allow only a rough assessment because the precise mechanisms leading to scarring alopecia are still unknown.	3.47577615630286
In order to develop more satisfying classifications, recent insights into biology and pathology of the hair follicle and follicular cycling have to be considered.	2.8831046470502195
The most important structures for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells which reside in the follicular bulge and the fibroblasts of the dermal papilla including the molecular communication between these two cell populations.	3.0494357182413383
Research in the field of scarring alopecia should aim at defining the pathological processes on any of the above mentioned levels which will lead to an irreversible damage of the hair follicle thus allowing the development of new therapeutic agents.	4.128606498859866
Rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis is a rare dermatologic disorder seen in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.	4.4217807052142675
The lesions may be pruritic leading to excoriations and crusts.	3.0760996292481337
Histology reveals a dense dermal infiltrate with neutrophilic granulocytes, while leukocytoclasia may be seen, vasculitits is not observed.	2.991895040217704
This overview of rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis may help remind the practioner to include this uncommon disorder in the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis-related dermatoses.	3.198519181398204
Background: The rehabilitation of low vision patients is of increasing importance since the number of these patients has grown rapidly.	4.326685852592896
We wanted to evaluate the actual spectrum of patients concerning age and diagnoses and the appropriate low vision aids (LVA) in 1 year.	3.192942592111751
It is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated electively.	2.7898270559159912
This study presents a risk calculation challenging this view.	3.2255373445795885
Three strategies are presented: prophylactic indication on principle (A), elective operation in every second case (B), and operation in case of strangulation only (C).	3.6076444885350436
On the basis of available epidemiological data it is calculated that, for the male German population aged 65 years and over 69 954 (A), 36 292 (B), and 2630 (C) inguinal hernia repairs would be necessary annually; 167 (A), 145 (B) and 123 (C) perioperative deaths would occur, connected with 1702 (A), 1373 (B) and 1048 (C) years of life lost, respectively.	2.978445948343114
Thus, operation of every inguinal hernia would result in a (small) reduction of life expectancy.	3.5457132280670476
These data provide evidence that in elderly patients the indication for operative treatment of inguinal hernias should depend upon symptoms and suffering.	3.8846163388745185
There is no reason to operate on asymptomatic patients because of a presumed risk of strangulation.	3.516457093796942
While seldom utilized by physicians, physiotherapists frequently make use of these special findings concerning the skin as a common part of their daily work.	3.4048192938242483
A certain problem exists in ranging correctly the corresponding segment of the spine, this mostly caused by the inaccurate idea of anatomical facts.	3.445306041376976
The actual as well as the former literature in this field shows very different views and opinions, all of them rather in contrast to the real anatomical findings.	3.8907742601119084
In the following the topographic-anatomic conditions are presented of which exact knowledge is necessary to evaluate the palpation's result "Kibler's plica positive" relative to its diagnostic valence.	3.1340175178787417
Aim of the study and methods: In the present study the correlation between ischemia induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials was investigated.	3.7385834982985817
In 16 patients with significant coronary artery disease and survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia an electrophysiologic study (EPS) was performed.	3.441932214999616
Before EPS (t1), at every stimulation interval and after induction of a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) the lactate concentration was measured in arterial blood and in the coronary sinus for calculation of the myocardial lactate extraction.	3.6024694719246884
Furthermore, before investigation, after induction of a VT/VF and after a 10 minute recovery phase an analysis of the signal averaged ECG was performed.	3.3012534623619465
Nine patients showed a so-called "lactate reversal", i.e., an increase of the lactate concentration in the coronary sinus over the concentration of the arterial blood as an expression of ischemia development, during inducibility of a VT/VF (group A).	3.835197962877342
The control group consisted of 7 patients without ischemia related VT/VF (group B).	3.0387588889102166
Results: In group A significant changes of the three late potential criteria were found between t1 and t2 (QRS:115.61 +/- 13.86 vs. 126.06 +/- 16.74, p=0.08; RMS: 25.81 +/- 22.26 vs. 13.11 +/- 10.72, p=0.01; LAS: 37.72 +/- 19.26 vs. 50.06 +/- 10.72, p=0.01).	2.716409509733708
In group B, no significant changes could be measured.	3.929909866180708
Furthermore, the prevalence of late potentials increased in group A from 66% (t1) to 89% (t2), whereas in group B no increase was detectable.	3.5903087147576165
Conclusions: These data suggest a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials in correlation with the inducibility of ventricular tycharrhythmias due to ischemic circumstances.	3.2075993709264434
Recent studies and reviews continue to report a high mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which involves a severe inflammatory reaction within the whole lung that is frequently associated with multiple-organ failure.	3.478748741902291
Important factors contributing to the poor results in severe ARDS are the aggressive procedures required to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation, such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory pressures and high inspired oxygen concentrations (FiO2) which themselves contribute to the progression of the disease.	3.373823815942403
As no specific therapy that reduces or prevents the general inflammatory reaction is known, current therapy is limited to procedures that minimize peak inspiratory pressures and FiO2.	3.2580942705284093
Therefore, pressure- and volume-limited ventilation modes with positive end-expiratory pressure, controlled hypercapnia, differential lung ventilation when appropriate, positioning (particularly prone), and aggressive dehydration are used.	3.2346625082872893
Should these procedures fail to improve arterial gas exchange, the patients may be additionally treated by veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange.	3.1701206369803967
To reduce the risk of severe haemorrhagic complications due to high levels of systemic heparinization, systems internally coated with covalently bound heparin, which allow a lower level of systemic anticoagulation, should be used.	3.4456834710909594
From April 1989 to August 1993, 89 patients were transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of severe ARDS; 52 were treated by combining the described conventional methods without artificial gas exchange (survival rate 88%) and 37 additionally underwent artificial gas exchange (survival rate 57%).	3.093955051505672
The overall survival rate was 75%.	3.221109667606642
On the basis of these experiences, we conclude that this step-by-step approach may improve survival in patients with severe ARDS.	3.376878527867818
Cutis marmorata teleangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is a rare congenital vascular disorder of the venous system.	3.9697446278673296
In 50% of cases there are associated anomalies of other organ systems.	3.4366381324752955
Clinical improvement of the cutaneous manifestations is noted in most cases and usually occurs during the first year of life.	4.221708009585616
We present a patient with CMTC with a band-like pattern following the L3 dermatome.	3.07671629786235
At the age of 13 years, the skin manifestations worsened, with ulcerations and intermittent claudication.	3.8381448335498543
Angiographic imaging revealed stenosis of the deep femoral artery, and the circumflex femoral artery and the first perforating arteries were not visualized.	4.663100650887266
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of CMTC with anomalies of the large arteries.	2.7781161369727774
Introduction: The efficacy of vascular surgery in the treatment of popliteal arterial aneurysms (PAA) and the justification of conservative therapy was investigated in the present study.	5.09866921864131
Materials and methods: From January 1985 to December 1996, 87 patients were operated on for PAA.	3.3363767143796057
The clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients were categorized concerning PAA-related symptoms, vascular run-off, and material used for vascular reconstruction.	3.127211647034653
Patients were examined, and the patency of the vascular reconstruction was checked by palpation and Doppler sonography.	3.7333006139087086
Results: The cumulative survival calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curve was 70% after 10 years.	2.970483826903224
Asymptomatic patients had the best results and patients with acute ischemia, the worst.	5.2010694627970935
The outcome concerning patent vs. occluded run-off and autologous vs. heterologous bypass material was similar.	2.712900786640636
Conclusion: Asymptomatic and uncomplicated PAA should be treated surgically.	3.148056403627883
Only PAA with a diameter less than 2 cm, and without thrombus on the vessel walls can be treated conservatively.	3.772158844895754
The majority of cases are due to autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis.	3.5771514951732244
In up to 10% of cases "self-healing" of the skin occurs.	4.648340013986381
There also were marked ectropion of the eyelids and eversion of the lips.	3.2624863838803715
After shedding of the membrane almost complete clearing of the skin occurred until the age of three months.	3.971616862398677
In the case reported here skin biopsies taken on the 20th day of life showed discrete and non-specific ultrastructural changes, with no features of lamellar ichthyosis or other cornification disorders.	3.081018781317029
Past research on the phenomenon of enhanced pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia syndome (FS) revealed evidence for both a higher pain magnitude in response to nociceptive stimuli (hyperalgesia) and a general perceptual amplification of sensations (hypervigilance).	3.287023023519358
In order to distinguish between these two aspects of disturbed sensory processing in FS, cerebral evoked potentials after brief painful laser and auditory stimuli were measured in 10 FS patients.	3.056757262215014
Results were compared with those from age-matched painfree controls.	3.6312243891634295
Amplitudes of middle-latency (N1) and long-latency (P2) laser evoked potentials (LEPs) were significantly higher in FS than in controls.	3.3249915278209827
Furthermore, laser intensity at pain but not at sensation threshold was lower in FS than in controls.	2.7684797707361843
However, auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) did not differ between groups.	3.2030629946286773
Enhanced N1 and P2 amplitudes of LEPs suggest stronger sensory and attentional processing of nociceptive information in FS, respectively.	2.9052444599721845
The concept of hypervigilance is challenged by the failure to find differences in auditory perception among FS and control patients.	2.8545603636063817
Yet, the importance of unpleasant intensities of auditory stimulation, not applied in this study, to reveal abnormal non-nociceptive perceptual amplification in FS is discussed.	3.727574239147732
In a prospective study, 53 fractures of the distal fifth of the tibia were stabilized by unreamed nailing.	3.4158171688989083
50 patients returned for follow-up.	3.3117256812783453
In 30 patients tibia and fibula were fractured at the same (distal) level; in 20 patients the fracture of the fibula was located more proximally.	3.5812467188487815
In 12 patients the fractures extended into the tibial pilon.	2.9240556953109667
Severe soft tissue damage was seen in 24 fractures (18 open, 6 closed).	3.7522421406348347
Ninety percent of all fractures healed uneventfully without further surgical intervention after unreamed nailing.	3.361529909723798
In two patients the unreamed nail had to be exchanged for a reamed tibial nail.	3.018152770376982
Bone grafting and secondary dynamization of the nail by removal of a proximal interlocking bolt were performed in one case each.	3.8143889486424425
Thirty-one fractures healed in anatomical position.	2.9205371056148173
Valgus or varus angulation of less than 5  ° occurred in 18 patients.	3.4609722167332224
One fracture healed with rotatory angulation of 15  °.	3.3190173340289393
The highest rate of complications (22 %) was seen in patients with distal fractures of the fibula without additional plating (of the fibula).	4.687350439172463
There was no deep infection.	3.0638348360779757
Distal fractures of the fibula should be stabilized by additional plating.	4.107464678607547
Because of the unreamed technique of implantation this procedure can also be used in grade II or III open fractures.	3.4043900693017606
Complex mechanisms have evolved in mammalian cells for regulating cellular lifespan.	3.090571376145677
Normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions.	2.995911210376069
In contrast, tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed immortalized.	2.9221045609945375
It has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the eukaryotic chromosomes - the telomeres - is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle.	3.821219902374902
The enzyme telomerase adds TTAGGG repeats onto mammalian telomeres, preventing their shortening.	2.850340908094214
Telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells, but detectable in tumor cells.	3.209277959653738
The activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in tumorigenesis in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become immortal.	3.644469299470968
This review describes the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase and their role in cellular senescence and human aging.	3.087837520868937
It summarizes aspects of telomerase in cancer and its function as a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker.	3.775927102460651
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases has developed into an important method in surgical pathology.	2.9223928903304732
We summarize our experience in this area based on 3500 analyses performed during the past 5 years.	3.969437598312332
The peculiarity of material from a pathological laboratory is the risk of DNA fragmentation as a consequence of tissue fixation.	3.82668422932228
For this reason the assays used must be adapted to this particular situation.	3.0002370708696935
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases, if performed according to appropriate quality standards, is a safe and effective technique with high sensitivity and specificity and results in an etiologically based diagnosis.	3.2760728569602136
The shift of age distribution within the population of industrialized societies has led to an increased need of treating diseases in elderly patients and at the same time in a higher number of patients bearing an increased operative risk.	3.710181037082804
Today, the development of surgical techniques and intensive care treatment enables us to carry out numerous procedures in geriatric patients.	3.968162767500468
Innovative surgical techniques like minimal invasive surgery with minor trauma due to the surgical approach changed patient's categories, also.	4.118739064350818
Taken together with other procedures causing less operative stress indications for patients who were not operable previously have changed.	3.5552337144667665
New developments such as organ transplantation and immunosuppression also generated totally new groups of patients with very distinct conditions for the operative procedure.	3.814678137788949
Vanishing indications or selection of patients as in peptic ulcer disease changed the surgical approach completely: Negative selection has shifted elective operative interventions in ulcer disease to emergency procedures.	3.285308496421892
Contrasting experiences made in most other countries and especially in the third world, in Germany economic restrictions have not been encountered as of yet.	4.09836903910263
Economical conditions, an increase in surgical procedures in elderly patients and advances in medical science will continue to change the surgical patient's characteristics profoundly.	3.779729372698624
From the physicians viewpoint we have to actively participate in this development by personal interaction with the patient, by interdisciplinary cooperation and prompt social and political action.	3.5837867824222167
Osteoid osteomas are tumors with intense clinical symptoms and extensive reactive bone changes far exceeding the volume of the lesion itself.	3.693764709356244
Because of their small size they can be approached by minimally invasive surgical procedures.	3.0495937030591653
We treated ten symptomatic patients with osteoid osteomas (n 6 hip point, n 1 iliac bone, n 1 femoral diaphysis, n2 tibial diaphysis) by excision of the nidus with a 3-mm Harlow-Wood needle using a percutaneous CT-guided approach.	3.249171399106967
Seven patients with residual tumor were treated with either thermocautery (n 2) or sclerosis with 1 ml of 96% ethanol (n 5).	3.1897438912647873
Six patients had instant and constant relief (3 years' observation) of their pain.	3.1249064654505223
In two patients a second transcutaneous intervention was successful.	3.0885045955236285
Only two patients needed open resection.	3.551187212249801
Compared with the invasive open resection of the tumors, sometimes even putting the stability of the femoral neck at risk, transcutaneous CT-guided enucleation of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma with additional sclerotherapy is a good alternative method, especially in the region of the femoral neck.	3.8373670754092237
We live in an epoch that could be designated as the post-Gutenberg-era.	3.2449411181554377
Writing is no longer the dominant sign system.	3.9850825042155464
It is replaced by electronic signs.	3.0981879510276356
We consider approximately the year 1950 as the turning-point between these two epochs, because by then, in the years after the 2nd World War the American households were saturated with televisions.	3.40057885643347
Thereby, the new sign system asserted itself.	3.248264098171217
The topic of this article is the transformation of our sign system and thereby of our worlds of symbols, the leap from the world of written signs into the world of electronic signs, and the possibility born out of it to create electronic objects, which I prefer to call virtual objects.	3.2579699264925237
The manipulation of object-choice and object-relationships accompanying this change and the role assigned to analysts in this new world will be considered as well.	2.8799269801639187
These electronic signs developed quickly a life of their own.	3.5249545616573257
A totally new class of objects came into being, the class of virtual objects.	3.019117459777126
These are electronically transformed, completed or wholly electronically produced objects.	2.7281082594478687
This procedure is accompanied by an industrialization of object-choice and object-relationships.	2.6029662286104975
A change of the socio-cultural understanding is also a consequence of this process.	3.4877133382391756
New patterns of socio-cultural understanding develop, that could be described as industrial feudalism.	3.283685385729133
The goal of this article is to describe the transformation of our world of signs and the connected industrialization of object relationships, and to interprete them according to our present possibilities.	3.313903136387815
In this article 34 randomized controlled trials examining peripherally mediated opioid effects after knee surgery are discussed.	2.7658323227434196
All studies examined small doses of morphine injected intraarticularly at the end of knee surgery, but not all studies did show an analgesic effect of the peripheral opioid.	4.007395618929678
Because of differing study designs a meta-analysis of the data is not possible.	3.6397537959387765
Dysplastic epithelia represent potentially precancerous conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case.	4.022428604351843
The positive predictive value of mild and moderate dysplasias of the uterine cervix is only about 13%.	3.122991557303785
Using DNA image cytometry on restained, conventional Pap-smears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells.	2.9084427128812615
The identification of DNA aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90%.	3.009012084707639
DNA aneuploidy qualifies squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade (H-SIL) which have to be treated whereas lack of DNA aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL) which have only to be controlled.	3.132442881742668
The methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation.	2.959492832266592
In this brief article I attempt to sketch a few salient insights from my career as a researcher and practitioner of psychotherapy: The key to successful therapy is undoubtedly the therapist's empathic listening, coupled with a series of other positive attributes and finely honed interpersonal skills.	2.6593001420965576
On the debit side, patients' hostility frequently evokes counterhostility from the therapist which not infrequently results in a negative outcome.	3.156982694927498
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a procedure for inserting a tracheal cannula without a large incision, without extensive dissection of pretracheal tissue, and without exposure of the trachea.	3.150319968376344
The early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare.	3.769551403798357
Although it is a simple procedure, it is not a minor operation.	5.188827234977223
Users must be familiar with the technique, the indications and contra-indications for the procedure, as well as the complications.	4.369126564870617
Proper training of the operation and knowledge of the procedure will avoid unnecessary complications.	4.530740437875922
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a relatively new technique for inserting a cannula in the tracheal lumen.	3.11976882451776
It can be done at the patients bedside with only minimal complications.	3.2715751816034753
A short history, the indications and contraindications, the early and late complications of the technique, and comparisons with other techniques as well as with conventional open tracheotomy are reviewed.	3.9256759724326074
In this study, a histologic and histomorphometric analysis of delayed and immediate-placed implants was performed.	2.758562867133964
An implantation of 16 self-cutting conical titanium screw implants was carried out in 8 beagle dogs.	3.2932269669003054
Of these implants, 8 were placed immediately after extraction of the second premolar and 8 implants were placed after 6 months of healing after extraction.	3.504179726902644
For dynamic histomorphometry, fluorochrome bone markers were injected at two different times prior to euthanasia.	2.8777944975607577
The specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically 8 months after implantation.	3.089432091759929
A histologic, dynamic, and static histomorphometry was performed with the aid of different computer programs.	3.9470702554030375
A mean surface of osseointegration of 75.7% and a mean soft tissue implant contact surface of 24.2% was seen in immediate-placed implants.	3.066753808631846
For delayed implantation, an osseointegrated surface of 80.7% and a soft tissue covering of 19.3% was examined.	2.9755648175168194
The fibrogenic structures in the cervical implant part were more dense and there were more adhesive epithelial elements (hemidesmosomes) around delayed implants.	3.051691614506772
The result of the dynamic and static histomorphometry showed no significant differences in the two groups (P < 0.1).	4.157804425234638
In conclusion, it can be stated that a new steady-state of the soft and hard tissue around dental implants was seen 8 months after implant insertion in both groups.	3.4265761708674383
There was a pseudoankylotic healing in the osseous part.	2.9216080496005072
The lower level of osseointegration in immediate-placed implants was caused by early resorption of bone in the crestal part.	2.913305432791813
Thus, a larger part of the implant was surrounded by soft tissue and a long epithelial attachment resulted.	3.6523851953783963
Polydactyly may be preaxial or tibial (halluxside), postaxial or ulnar (side of the little toe) and central (middle toes).	2.9457748444585468
The duplication may appear at the distal and medial phalanges or at the whole digit.	3.4680632855267133
The metatarsal bone may be partwise or completely duplicated, the accessory toes may share only one metatarsal.	2.7637397458169337
Surgical intervention may be indicated in shoeproblems, for esthetic reasons or, especially in duplication of the metatarsales, because of secondary deviation of the toes and therefore shoeproblems or plantar callosities.	3.3851997447257416
Preoperative analysis including x-ray is of great importance to achieve good functional and cosmetic results.	3.628923780220614
Across centers, transfusion can vary eightfold for the same mediastinal drainage after adult cardiac operations.	3.0951828562361885
Excessive blood drainage resulting in increased transfusions occurs in 29 % of patients.	3.339646459997615
Various strategies have been proposed to decrease bleeding and allogenic transfusion requirements in the perioperative period of heart surgery.	3.6978361452266517
Avoidance of preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations, the use of autologous blood, and adherence to a strict transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogenic transfusions.	4.082681033578429
Perioperatively, maintenance of normothermia contributes to improved hemostasis.	3.230677243074754
Injections with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) are considered the first-line treatment for spasmodic torticollis (ST), blepharospasm (BL) and hemifacial spasm (HFS).	2.831216482615796
Because BTX brings only temporary and partial relief, patients frequently try other additional therapies to minimize their symptoms.	2.8725428372434942
The subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with ST, BL and HFS was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire.	3.119328068460521
Two hundred questionnaires were considered (112 TS, 54 BL, 34 HFS).	2.960801333836547
BTX was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups (median: 2=good effect).	3.701189474981288
Despite Citalopram and physiotherapy (median: 3=average effect), all other therapies were rated with a median of >=4 (=minimal effect).	3.599326496780195
Patients with ST tried 7.7, patients with BL 2.4 and patients with HFS 2.6 different types of therapy.	3.578665994595284
In conclusion, BTX is the most effective treatment for patients with ST, BL and HFS, as rated subjectively.	2.9946225154121917
Further evaluation of therapies additional to BTX injections is recommended.	3.084742271188212
The perioperative morbidity and mortality is mainly influenced by the type and duration of surgery as well as the patient's preoperative state of health.	4.308729607004559
Anesthesia per se, however, may also result in severe perioperative (patho)physiological changes, which may be both desired (e.g.	3.373142765995607
analgesia, vasodilation in vascular surgery) or detrimental (e.g.	3.083163226858176
hypothermia, ventilatory depression) and which may differ depending on the anesthetic technique used (e.g.	3.2151050795788336
general anesthesia vs. regional anesthesia).	3.5087404968292417
Yet, all anesthestic techniques have in common, that their effects are not limited to the duration of the surgical intervention, but may expand far into the postoperative period.	4.304724799333342
Therefore, many trials have been performed in the past aiming to compare the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the incidence of postoperative techniques, no significant advantage of one or the other technique has been identified up to now with respect to postoperative mortality or severe morbidity.	4.425650205404546
This finding may be due to at least three factors.	3.9989591213148814
1) Many side-effects related to anesthesia - due to close postoperative monitoring - are detected and treated early in the postoperative phase (e.g.	3.231744763812699
in the recovery room), thereby preventing serious complications.	3.2039750198750605
3) Besides the factor 'anesthesia', may other factors contribute to the anesthesia related morbidity and mortality (e.g.	3.3068304028240187
the factor 'anesthetist') which are hardly quantified.	3.3830510576381365
The fact that clear advantages for a single technique have not yet been demonstrated must not, however, result in anesthetic 'nihilism'.	3.4119188347877745
Rather there may be good reasons in the individual patient (e.g.	3.696954230118886
lack of a recovery room), to prefer a certain anesthetic technique or drug over another, in order to lower the individual risk of anesthesia.	3.924466619180373
Whether the use of a certain technique - e.g.	3.5485641847491594
spinal or epidural anesthesia - may contribute to a reduction of specific postoperative surgical complications (e.g.	3.463372066066064
rate of reocclusion subsequent to peripheral vascular surgery) is presently under investigation.	3.4125503802862998
This paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose.	3.671285897366446
We then introduce its objectives, the members of the study group, the composition of the collective and selection of cases, and the methods used for ascertainment and recording of data.	4.244086148018734
Results are then presented with reference to the various hypotheses put forward.	3.7593766679986818
After some introductory remarks about the traumatizing experience many parents have after the birth of a very small preterm baby (<= 1500 g), a developmental risk model is presented.	3.082494535473321
This is the basis for an early beginning preventive psychotherapeutic intervention.	3.45806529909435
In the Ulm Study the comprehensive parent-centered intervention program includes insight oriented focal individual psychotherapy, supportive group psychotherapy, a home visit and a video-based sensitivity training.	2.8613353551957914
The intervention aims to improve parental coping, the process of attachment and parent-infant interaction.	3.0372190308002254
We report the case of a 55-year-old male patient who underwent transanal endoscopic microsurgery for recurrent benign rectal adenoma.	2.7322661277372435
He developed severe postoperative retroperitoneal phlegmon and sepsis and died 28 days after the operation due to untreatable diffuse intraabdominal bleeding caused by persistent thrombocytopenia.	3.2557903031870588
From 1921 to 1933 he was the favorite pupil of Ferdinand Sauerbruch in Munich and Berlin.	2.9437006460441903
The assumption of power by the Nazi-regime forced Nissen to resign his position and end his career in Germany.	2.758356675338481
He took over the surgical chair in Istanbul, Turkey.	3.0181059660898164
Emigrating in 1939 to the USA, he held surgical positions in hospitals at New York and accepted in 1952 the chair of Surgery at the University of Basel, Switzerland.	3.14436433809602
Nissen died in Riehen/Basel on 22 January 1981.	2.9886240993985647
Nissen was a critical observant clinician, an efficient and popular physician, a teacher and a speaker.	3.0846122769382442
Of historical significance are pioneering works in thoracic surgery, the first successful pneumectomy in man, the classical works about the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and hiatus hernia.	3.6594700498330437
The Nissen-Rossetti type of fundoplication has remained the standard procedure in Europe and the USA.	3.5124357436119666
This study describes the approach that is necessary in outpatient surgery in order to carry out the operation safely.	4.115578817446814
Between 1994 and 1997, the author supervised 4588 outpatient operations, of which 3020 were arthroscopic.	3.2787186587728754
The observed complications are listed and evaluated.	3.1365193146435466
Overall, outpatient surgery is well accepted by the patients.	3.755285357872708
The criteria for denying a patient surgery on an outpatient basis are laid out.	2.934785184422939
The Schering Atlas is a teaching file in CT and MRI anatomy designed for physicians and students.	3.3428037136618376
It is available on CD-ROM, shows good image quality, and is easy to use in medium-price-range personal computer systems.	3.328901923456601
Because of the amount and quality of image material, the Schering Atlas's price is appropriate for institutions, but not for private users.	3.3616382743275883
M. Linehan developed "dialectical behavioral therapy" specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients.	2.8088629471757685
It rests on a biosocial model that assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress.	3.1952910623396136
The numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self-destructive behavior, inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem-solving.	2.641822334055925
This concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them.	3.073714494024974
A comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies.	2.995285502567426
Parallel to development of the therapy itself, a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual's guidelines, thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation.	3.511470546318815
An initial controlled, randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels.	3.433732972688438
In the current endeavor to develop disorder-specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders, "dialectical behavioral therapy" is a noteworthy model.	3.8147775965465196
Complications associated with the application of a halo device are not infrequent; however, osteomyelitis of the skull with a consecutive subdural abscess is a rare but severe complication.	3.8716192087464494
We present the case of a patient with a subdural abscess as a result of a local pin-track infection of the halo device, in whom pathological behavior was the primary clinical finding.	3.501638124012501
The possible complications associated with the halo device are discussed with emphasis on associated head injuries and preexisting neurological diseases, as well as indications for the halo, clinical symptoms of pin-track infections, necessary diagnostic measurements and the appropriate treatment.	4.066717615702904
The attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system - analogical to electronic data processing systems - as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system.	3.252364048024708
Thereby dysfunctions can be seen as misplaced variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences.	3.3235852177789798
Especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through needling, a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function.	3.23271568701268
Empirical data on costs of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany are rare.	3.1656129049125523
There is a lack of cross-sectional studies as well as of any analysis of the long-term course of mental health care costs.	3.856874279135389
This study combines data from two cost-studies on patients with schizophrenia, conducted in the same catchment area at an interval of 15 years, to draw conclusions about the long-term course of these costs.	3.702148644540059
The direct costs of comprehensive community based mental health care had increased by 77.0% during 15 years, while the costs of a permanents stay in a long-term ward of a psychiatric hospital had increased by 78.5% in the same period.	3.563970673621198
This increase was 27 and 28.5 per cent higher than the general rise in cost of living in Germany during the interval between the two studies.	3.818185424210756
Thus, this rise of costs must be seen as a consequence of the great deficits and the resulting basic improvement of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany, which was demanded by an expert-commission of the government in the mid-seventies.	3.656612534504142
Background: The usefulness of Holter monitoring to detect rarely occuring symptoms seems to be limited.	3.3779286022898627
In adults the event recorder has already been a precise diagnostic tool in evaluating palpitations and syncopes.	3.141506974407789
There have been few reports of the implementation of cardiac monitoring with an event recorder in children.	3.2757699210159927
The immunomodulating effect of primary surgical intervention was investigated in 33 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx.	3.419733284971719
An operation time longer than 7 h was significantly associated with a decrease in lymphocytes, CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD8+ T-lymphocytes.	3.6658629421331264
The CD4/CD8-ratio as a marker for the down-regulation of the cellular immune response was slightly decreased but was still in the normal range.	3.5677652304241727
CD4-lymphocyte counts increased 7 days after operation while CD8 lymphocytes were found elevated 4 weeks after sugery.	3.40273793572667
The in vitro stimulation of the lymphocytes was impaired for 1 to 4 weeks.	3.4138252507259614
Interleukins, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor did not show any changes after surgery.	3.509936975568483
Decreases of lymphocytes, especially CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, were significantly associated with the time of operation and the volume of blood loss.	4.372697374287965
Extensive trauma, age, different kinds of anesthesia and intensive care interventions were not associated with specific immunomodulating effects, although these factors might be responsible for suppressing cytokine responses.	3.668463510960759
Monoamine uptake inhibitors influence the neurotransmissions of noradrenaline (NA) and/or serotonin (5-HT); their effect on nociception is thought to take place predominantly within the spinal cord.	3.8226402329086158
Antidepressant drugs seem to differ in their properties as analgesics and as thymoleptics.	3.476647900689816
The present work is aimed at correlating the special mechanism of action of antidepressants in diminishing nocicepetion with the pharmacological profile of these drugs in clinical pain treatment.	3.185169485260724
From a preclinical, experimental point of view, it can be expected, that mixed type uptake blockers should be superior to selective NA or 5-HT uptake inhibitors.	3.4826241467952976
The analgesic profile of antidepressants was established by a metaanalysis of clinical trials on the effect of these drugs, given alone or in combination with other analgetics, in chronic pain syndromes.	3.955944866471588
57 Clinical trials were separated into 5 groups according to their scientific quality: [1] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with high power; [2] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with low power; [3-4] open controlled studies or studies with historical controls; [5] case reports.	3.0701258969751737
A study was positive if the tested antidepressant was more effective than placebo or the compared drug or seemed beneficial with respect to the interval of its previous absence.	3.306474400706115
A statement about the appropriate dosage of these drugs in chronic pain treatment, however, must wait for properly conducted dose finding studies which include the measurement of plasma concentrations.	3.7792968611891244
Intensive care medicine for both surgical and medical patients has a common scientific and clinical basis.	3.526771582519119
In critically ill patients the medical conditions are complex and can be managed only by specialists thoroughly trained in intensive care medicine.	3.6687791520933666
Therefore, surgeons as well as anesthesiologists must have a detailed theoretical and clinical knowledge of intensive care medicine.	3.4672530682145157
Surgical training places the emphasis on operative skills, while intraoperative management of the patient by the anesthesiologist calls for skills involved in intensive care medicine.	3.1452416830047305
Interdisciplinary cooperation between specialists is essential to improve the quality of intensive care medicine further.	4.5130391099272975
The cooperation that already exists between surgeons and anesthesiologists makes closer collaboration in the future a logical step.	3.343798424055259
In this review article data of retrospective studies on the therapeutic effects of oxygen are summarized and possible indications for this therapy suggested.	3.484065532196244
Studies in infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) showed that (i) if SaO2 was kept >= 93 % via generous prescription of home oxygen, rates of sudden death were much lower than in studies where this was less generously prescribed, (ii) weight gain was significantly better with O2 therapy than without it, (iii) increasing SaO2 from 82 to 93 % by providing low-flow oxygen resulted in a 50 % reduction of pulmonary artery pressure, (iv) hypoxia could cause a significant increase in airway resistance, and (v) low-flow oxygen reduced the frequency of intermittent falls in SaO2 to < 85 % even in infants who had values of >= 90 % at rest.	3.2833700282202085
These data suggest that oxygen therapy should be considered in CLD infants if baseline SaO2 is < 93 %.	3.206698306234534
For older infants, particularly with CF, only few data are available.	3.617548685456854
In these patients oxygen may only be given if SaO2 is < 90 % unless there are clinical symptoms related to hypoxaemia, e. g. pulmonary hypertension.	3.124802983050131
Regarding the practical aspects of home oxygen therapy, provision of liquid oxygen via nasal cannulae appears to be the method of choice.	3.378314608029223
Side effects include the risk of CO2 retention, which occurs occasionally in children with CF or sleep-related upper airway obstruction, but has not been reported for infants with CLD.	3.8755571717668076
To identify this potential side effect and to determine the exact amount of oxygen required, performance of a sleep recording of SaO2 and CO2 with and without oxygen is suggested.	3.509730841516292
In infants with CLD, home monitoring of oxygenation should also be considered.	3.3357874905617995
Fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social-economic relevance.	3.3124368625131764
For treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards.	3.2649620085917492
The demand for stable osteosynthesis of A3-, B2-B3 and C1-C2-fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting, even for the elder patient.	2.8869775804341384
The isolated external fixation with K-wires represent special situation.	3.1812192838250115
Supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development.	3.234188143607595
Introduction: Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy is rare and represents a high risk for mother and fetus.	3.665688033205458
Due to the variable clinical presentation it may be mistaken for preeclampsia.	3.215945746014601
Case: A 34-year-old primiapara with hypertension up to 240/120 mmHg.	3.1764649955083217
After diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma its resection together with lymph node metastasis in the 17th week of gestation was performed.	3.64431529353239
Conclusion: The definitive diagnosis is confirmed by elevation of serum catecholamines and their metabolites in a 24-h urine collection.	3.28081543480705
Localization during pregnancy can be made by ultrasound and MRI.	4.402666373806241
The definitive treatment is surgical removal after administration of adrenergic blockers.	3.467460227351452
If discovered later in pregnancy, delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumor resection is recommended.	3.107985071188066
Since about 10 % of pheochromocytomas are malignant, postpartum screening is required to detect and treat extraadrenal or metastatic tumors by MIBG scintigraphy, chemotherapy or surgical procedures.	3.284215128267368
Ionizing radiation from natural or man-made sources may affect human health.	2.8589660615005004
The main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer.	3.379432376052792
To quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed.	3.087222672264892
The ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation.	4.008440133077982
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated.	3.5673272614965903
In an asymptomatic 13-year-old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the Aa.	3.5326594138426866
iliacae, a combination which so far has not been described, that has not been reported before.	4.037143014261312
The vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic.	3.2257793430820825
Angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the Aa.	3.091743581760792
After 13 months of low-density-lipoprotein(LDL)-apheresis angiographically there was no pregression, but even slight improvement of vascular the disease.	3.3455470732335497
Discussion: Since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination, we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia.	3.304346904007187
LDL-apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients.	4.119144529395557
Since 1993 almost 400 patients with port wine stains have been treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	3.0320370815559152
The therapeutic effect on 61 adult patients was evaluated.	3.084011537705127
After a mean of 2.16 treatments the colour lightened by between 33% and 100% in 70% of these patients.	3.3575678111095266
The best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains.	3.8366801134340243
In this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful.	3.3346195738463718
The rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5%.	3.309605227289721
The results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions.	3.3571891466112933
The flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains.	3.6929068991231695
Most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures.	3.3654449867735234
Depending on the scope of the sutures affected, the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects.	3.7259294932568916
The etiopathology is still unclear.	3.272580863554353
Various therapies have been developed over the past 100 years.	3.771078282465556
However, Tessier's technique of fronto-orbital advancement has been an important milestone in the treatment of these malformations.	3.5679428755810507
Numerous adjustments have since perfected this operational technique.	2.9936410985767266
It is now possible to treat practically all skull malformations with the surgical techniques available today.	3.096546698641595
At the same time, these techniques have also aided the advancements in tumor surgery and traumatology.	3.0339947449227336
In most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons.	2.905169872914182
This is different for injuries of the extensor tendon.	3.1278431364581847
Three quarters of injuries of the extensor tendon are closed injuries.	3.372354085902894
The Shouldice operation has evolved to become the classic procedure for open pure tissue repair for inguinal hernias.	3.214504769402373
The operation is an important part of a surgeon's repertoire as he may need to perform the procedure at some critical time, especially when faced with strangulation, when tension-free prosthetic repairs and laparoscopic approaches fail.	3.4050253126040966
When properly done, the Shouldice repair yields results that have set standards for all other techniques to emulate.	3.194602709771859
Other particular advantages of the technique are: safety, the use of local anaesthesia, benign postoperative complications and the cost, which is the most reasonable of all surgical techniques.	4.797359506380726
Acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge.	3.6064989754239267
Acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical/surgical emergency mandating prompt diagnosis (clinical awareness, angiography) and therapy (exploratory laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction; embolectomy, thrombectomy; and/or bowel resection).	3.003903010974359
The difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from 70 % to 90 % in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from 20 % to 70 % in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins.	4.334755536110124
Improved survival from nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high-risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures (intra-arterial infusion of papaverine through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection).	3.57530482090556
For assessment of bowel viability, the clinical judgement during first- or second-look exploration is still the most reliable parameter.	3.5626106901482606
The surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes aortomesenteric grafting and transaortic endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom-free patients.	3.8051702739019873
Prophylactic reconstruction of visceral arteries is indicated only in certain limited circumstances.	3.3448362190908205
Thirty-nine of 63 patients undergoing deep anterior rectal resection received a straight coloanal anastomosis (CAA); the remaining 24 patients additionally had a colon-j-pouch (CPA) constructed.	2.626032718531718
After pouch-anal anastomosis, local septic complications occurred in 12.5 % of patients compared to 20.5 % after coloanal anastomosis.	3.219189631893866
Stool frequency after pouch-anal anastomosis was 3.3 per 24 h compared to 5.2 per 24 h after straight anastomosis within the first year after ileostomy closure (P = 0.053).	3.092890045971144
Continence was slightly better in the pouch group (n. s.), and anal manometry showed a significant postoperative decrease only in resting pressure after straight coloanal anastomosis (P < 0.001).	3.663261346681209
This study supports the construction of a colon-j-pouch after deep rectal resection, as the pouch-anal anastomosis has fewer local septic complications and seems to improve functional outcome.	3.080393073925457
The introduction of flow-directed pulmonary artery (PA) catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology.	3.17290447303155
The high purchase price, however, is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill.	3.9072727316870166
The aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to standardly used intermittent monitoring of Sv\=O2 and CO.	2.8452572877371485
Purpose: Persistent hypotony with maculo-pathy is a severe complication of mitomycin C when used during filtration surgery.	2.9135496206125553
We wanted to know whether this complication can be controlled by a surgical reintervention yielding tight closure of the initial sclerostomy.	3.4836911046853176
The detection of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial (i) or necrotizing (n) pancreatitis (AP).	2.941004867115655
The increase in the level of cytokines in the blood of patients with AP may correlate with the severity of the disease.	4.509080995535388
In a prospective clinical trial from October 1992 to August 1993, 23 patients with AP were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine detection by commercially available Elisa kits and C-reactive protein (CRP) by laser nephelometry.	2.799563229682303
Six of 11 patients with nAP died either early (n = 1) or of late septic complications.	3.4055666399013087
The peak of cytokine and CRP level in the first 3 days of hospitalization was used for calculation.	3.8908444412878285
The IL-6 concentration in the blood reached up to 2600 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and dropped to almost zero in the next days, independently of the clinical course.	3.2600921858471246
The differentiation of i- versus nAP, using a cutoff line of 600 pg/ml, was correct in 20 patients [87 %, sensitivity (SE): 82 %, specificity (SP): 91 %, P < 0.001].	3.264809882632081
The blood levels of IL-8 reached a maximum of 1381 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and showed a correlation with the clinical course in the following days.	3.0939330479270497
The peak of IL-8 blood levels indicated correctly the severity of AP in 18 out of 23 patients using a cutoff level of 200 pg/ml (accuracy: 78 %, SE: 82 %, SP: 75 %, P < 0.01).	3.1393077322881755
The CRP levels increased up to a maximum of 535 mg/l and indicated the course of AP correctly in 18 out of 22 patients (SE and SP 82 %, P < 0.01).	3.3937302189748793
There was no correlation between cytokine blood levels and mortality.	2.7755459645680456
In the blood samples of five patients with i- or nAP, no TNF- was detectable.	3.3083425819526555
The blood levels of IL-6, and to a lesser extent of IL-8 and CRP, can predict the severity and early systemic complications of AP.	3.9347552702983157
The excessive rise in cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells (macrophages, lymphocytes and endothelial cells) in the course of AP, inducing early systemic complications.	3.603153503952583
Therefore, the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters (pores < 1 µm) of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study.	3.1713627845681196
The analyzed hydroxyapatites were of synthetic, bovine, and phytotroph origin.	3.0310042502956227
The tricalcium phosphates and the bioglasses included only synthetic materials.	2.9554635932217987
The gas adsorption of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric N2/Kr system (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics).	2.7504141191558396
Additionally, for materials with a specific surface area (> 2 m2/g) the pore size distribution was evaluated by the BJH-method.	3.4824832291981345
Two of the materials evaluated astonishingly large dimensions of the specific surface area (BioOss 79.7 m2/g, Algipore new 14.6 m2/g).	2.735713241346746
A medium surface area was found for Algipore old (4.9 m2/g) and Interpore200 (2.64 m2/g).	3.12618800735408
All other included materials showed only small sizes of the specific surface area (Ceros80 1.8 m2/g, Ceros82 1.31 m2/g, Cerasorb 1.2 m2/g, Biobase 0.7 m2/g, Endobone 0.7 m2/g, Perioglas 0.6 m2/g, Allotropat50 0.23 m2/g, Biogran 0.2 m2/g).	2.636165015547817
The materials with large and medium sizes of the specific surface area evaluated the following pore diameters: BioOss 2-50 nm, Algipore new 2-100 nm, Algipore old 5-50 nm, Interpore200 2-100 nm.	2.820819389121642
Pore sizes less than 2 nm were not found in relevant numbers.	3.769578822737341
The materials BioOss, old and new Algipore, and Interpore200 contain a large interconnecting mesopore system (diameter < 1 µm).	2.8454260829382707
For the materials Biobase, Endobone, Perioglas, Allotropat 50, and Biogran this cannot be assumed.	2.730204495455674
The materials Ceros80, Ceros82, and Cerasorb evaluated a specific surface area between those and might include only a small part of these interconnecting pores.	3.0876429147429683
An influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested.	3.6484296245280654
In the present Part 4 ten possibly useful targets for future research are formulated:...	2.785076080252564
Using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95-98 % in stage I disease and 80-95 % in stage IIA/B can be achieved.	3.222260973844504
Disease specific survival reaches 100 %.	3.3261069438335302
Likewise, radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) in a solitary testis or in case of a double-sided TIN yielding safe eradication of the in-situ carcinoma of the testis.	4.052354203063706
Objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates.	3.671810425729918
A forty year old healthy adult man was admitted to our out-patient department because of a highly elevanted rheumatoid factor.	3.543409334154077
Since the person was planning an extended stay in Africa, we performed an extensive history, clinical and laboratory examination to rule out oligosymptomatic inflammatory diseases.	3.601504859714049
We further analyzed if the person presented genetic risk factors to develop rheumatic diseases in the future or if the presence of the rheumatoid factor could be a reaction to multiple immunizations.	3.8932987263914764
Possible explanations for an elevated rheumatoid factor including the genetic risk factors are discussed.	3.350170367457859
A multifactorial etiology underlies the  majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD).	3.182699999180817
Both ill-defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease.	3.5459601006832497
Allele 4 of ApoE is a genetic risk factor.	3.670274175386183
Its presence increases the risk of developing AD.	4.174620014656088
However, presence of e4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise.	3.3016870449568163
Apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease, there are rare variants which are inherited as Mendelian traits.	3.5712302117142456
To date three genes are known that can be  mutated in these rare forms of AD.	3.452727691435237
Of these, mutations in the gene presenilin 1 on chromosome 14 are most frequent.	2.8961938724156107
In addition, mutations in the gene presenilin 2 on chromosome 1 and in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP on chromosome 21) occur in autosomal dominant AD.	2.9369443506606756
This article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of AD and discusses its relevance for patients with AD and their relatives.	3.7602453258060375
In recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother-daughter-relationship with the conceptions of the 'lesbian complex' (Poluda-Korte), the 'symbiotic illusion' (Halberstadt-Freud), the 'higher permeability of the ego-boundaries' (Rohde-Dachser), and the 'conflict of separation-individuation which has to be resolved again and again throughout life' (Berger).	3.143611937108241
In the light of these conceptions it is hypothesized that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender (female-female psychoanalyses) a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre-oedipal mother-daughter-relationship are revided.	2.742763503285271
Case vignettes and a literary example illustrate the risks as well as possible resolutions engendered by these early relationship dynamics, as these are reactivated in the here and now of the analyst's relationship towards her patient.	3.004288523580732
There has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years.	3.9887848933583507
Associated injuries to the urogenital and vascular system as well as nerve injuries worsen the prognosis.	4.256739943674308
Over a five year period 126 patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated.	3.713001503706707
Out of these 39 (30.9%) sustained additional peripelvic injuries and represent the study sample.	2.9601530224044676
Type B injuries according to the AO classification occurred in 16 (41%) patients, type C fractures in 23 (59%) patients.	3.749746546227186
The spleen, liver and kidney were the most frequently injured organs (58.9%), followed by urogenital lesions (46.6%), nerve injuries (25.6%) and vascular lesions (15.3%).	3.5733864009346776
The most common extrapelvic lesions were thoracic injuries in 56.4% and severe head injuries (GCS<8) in 33.3%.	2.957559187955264
The mean Hannover Polytraumascore was 35.6 points, the mean Injury Severity Score 27.6 points.	3.106223199725368
Osteosnthesis was performed in 21 pelvic ring fractures (53%), eight procedures (50%) in type B fractures and 13 (56%) in type C fractures.	4.008704768641861
In type B injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases, in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case.	4.2060760430632875
In type C injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients.	3.54525911891044
In four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral bars.	3.349312696578208
Three patients had their additional acetabular fracture plated through a anterior approach.	2.7808712090859053
All surviving 28 patients were followed up for an average of 18 months (range 7--59 months) after the trauma.	4.377891367428144
The patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the German Society of Trauma Surgery.	3.367107340244357
53.4% of the type B fractures showed a good clinical outcome, 47.6% a poor outcome.	3.8416271816158134
80% of the type B and 23% of the type C fractures had a good radiological outcome.	3.810278606535278
20% of type B and 77% of type C injuries had a poor radiological outcome.	4.009872485934156
Five patients (12.8%) sustained persistent urological symptoms.	2.994845136709266
Three of these had urinary dysfunction, two used permanent cystotomies due to their severe neurolgical deficit after a head injury.	2.8572693329722494
Ten patients with nerve injuries at the time of trauma suffered long term neurological dysfunction of the lumbosacral plexus.	3.4519329405734975
The mortality rate was 28%.	3.361199553182576
Seven patients died in the emergency room due to uncontrollable bleeding, four in the intensive care unit from multi-organ failure.	3.209462528103997
The management of complex pelvic trauma consists of fracture treatment and interdisciplinary treatment of the associated injury.	3.424426515439749
Lesions of the abdominal organs or of major vessels must be addressed first if hemodynamic instability is present.	3.10355527947191
Injuries to smaller vessels can be embolized percutaneously.	2.9989555637513243
Urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency, urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks .We recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression.	3.8866273916625835
The treatment of choice for the anterior pelvic ring is tension band wiring or plating.	3.122179090224926
Type C fractures require posterior ring stabilization which should be postponed until four days post admission.	3.1440597010036324
Dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with two different psychopathological syndromes - impulsive aggressivity resulting form a lack of stimulation of the "behavior inhibition system" on the one hand and the manifestation of clinical depression and compulsive syndromes on the other.	3.1231553217392904
The examination of primate behavior provides a model which may reconciliate these seemingly contradictory hypotheses.	2.9381159791197042
According to primate experiments, monoaminergic depletion results in anxious and desperate behavior only if the individual has previously been exposed to social isolation stress, which in turn induces a decrease in the central serotonin turnover rate.	3.144052949776363
Young non-human primates who experience early social separation stress are anxious and fearful, while as adults they tend to be aggressive, consume excessive amounts of alcohol and are less intoxicated by alcohol intake.	2.76843755941903
These observation indicate the importance of social separation stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and antisocial behavior and may point to prophylactic and pharmacological treatment strategies.	3.717491868357305
The implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses (PCL) leads to greater trauma to the eye than endocapsular PCL implantation.	2.6001767416224824
Persistent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long-term prognosis.	3.2805417606111065
Using laser-tyndallometry, we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long-term postoperative course for both surgical procedures.	4.0858992041903095
During the first 3 postoperative days, flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured PCL than in the conventional PCL group.	3.871050247001439
Cell counts after transscleral suture fixation (27.7 +/- 18.3/0.075 mm3) decreased slightly during the first 5 postoperative days.	2.9363569468528663
In contrast, the conventional PCL group regained the preoperative level (2.5 +/- 5.1) after 3 days.	3.005591339849868
After 3 months, no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups.	3.2377584482021784
After implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses, breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional PCL implantation.	2.71633375665813
No signs of a persistent disorder of the barrier were found.	3.7371293314520915
There is clear evidence for obstructive sleep apnea as an independent cause of arterial hypertension.	3.5306349556720615
We report a case of intracranial hemorrhage with systemic hypertension resistant to antihypertensive medication, which could only be adjusted after effective treatment of coexisting sleep-disordered breathing.	3.180527221980785
The 36 year old male (body mass index 31 kg/m2) was admitted to hospital three weeks before for intracranial bleeding at the left external capsule.	3.2720683511344575
Diagnosis of primary hypertension was made after extensive work-up in the acute hospital.	4.4983172643181915
Blood pressure was adjusted with five-fold antihypertensive medication at the time of admission to neurological rehabilitation, but was still elevated with "non-dipping" as determined by long-term measurement despite medications above the recommended dosages.	3.580774112921915
Polysomnography confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.	4.315716372654057
10 days after initiation of treatment with nasal CPAP blood pressure control was easier with normal dipping at night.	3.4636609048874356
Medication could be reduced during rehabilitation with further reduction after discharge.	3.5944307285875006
Moderate obstructive sleep apnea appears to be the cause of severe hypertension resistant to pharmacological therapy in this patient.	3.8803619366616178
The case underlines the impact of diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing for the secondary prevention of stroke.	4.172848317776483
The possibility of a specific origin of joint infection should be considered in finding the diagnosis.	3.8220966490615966
This is demonstrated in a case of tuberculosis of the hip treated in the Dept.	4.267923697351959
of Trauma Surgery in collaboration with the Medical Dept.	3.3145032518027993
Microbiological and imaging examinations are essential to plan and perform a combined therapy of hip arthroplasty and concomittant medical antituberculous therapy.	3.544829794856378
In accordance to a literature review, this procedure proved successful for both eliminating the local infection and the functional outcome of the operation.	3.963106333220661
The purpose of our studies was to investigate experimentally the dose-dependent effects of extracorporeal shock waves on tendon and bone and to unveil therapeutic possibilities in tendopathies and pseudarthroses.	3.188086803165151
From January 1994 to January 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy as a result of endophthalmitis.	3.689419207441142
All patients received intraocular and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients in the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study.	3.726498460046591
The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the visual outcome of surgical treatment.	3.2399433672341735
Tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long-term ventilated ICU patients.	4.455607413751749
In the last few years, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy.	3.2993607968414556
Recently, there is another percutaneous technique according to Fantoni with translaryngeal airway access (TLT) available.	3.0968661777527866
Our study seeks to evaluate TLT in terms of complications and practicability.	3.3324257699059308
In 47 patients of our surgical ICU, elective TLT was performed.	3.3870026009804945
Mean operative time was 9.8 +/- 10.9 (range 6-27) minutes.	2.9741977456598865
Severe complications, such as bleeding, aspiration or infection of the tracheostoma have never been noted.	3.8183823646359563
A slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in 25 patients intraoperatively, demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily.	3.1512381412249115
However, no patient became hypoxic during the procedure.Since during the procedure gas exchange may worsen, TLT should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80%.	3.2786422719401633
Despite the fact that severe complications associated with TLT have recently not yet been reported, physicians who perform TLT should be well-trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy, too.	3.515279391167017
According to our present data, TLT seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to PDT.	3.2073081011629845
Nevertheless, for a definiteve evaluation of TLT, further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary.	4.442601528319588
There are no direct associations between testosterone levels and sexual function in the aging male.	3.115814043040976
A study of 169 patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions.	3.414778757125948
In volunteers, in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of GnRH, no alteration in sexual reactions occurred.	3.5561056951778154
It is possible that other testosterone fractions are more meaningful than the total testosterone.	2.914379438155188
However, all the known fractions correlate closely.	3.044637690244246
The significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now.	3.701208802955383
In an animal experiment, the intracavernous pressure, the density of -receptors, and the PDES activity depended on normal testosterone levels.	3.5093406334585673
It is not known whether different testosterone levels influence the effectiveness of treatment procedures for erectile dysfunction in humans.	3.262279123197367
In a 65 years old male patient 38 cc of a 7.45% potassium chloride-solution was inadvertently infused within 3 hours into an epidural catheter on the first postoperative day.	3.2243620643525897
The epidural potassium chloride administration resulted in a paresis and painful paraesthesia of the patient's legs and a level of sensory blockade to TH 11.	3.3248939009608556
Furthermore vegetative symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia were observed.	3.063450463986891
For therapy a single bolus of 40 mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously followed by an epidural infusion of sodiumchloride 0,9% 99 cc/h for several hours.	3.1053415562407825
About 6 hours after the start of infusion all symptoms had disappeared.	3.16067943762218
It is proposed that the use of colour-coded epidural catheter devices and coloured electrolyte solutions as well as infusion-pumps with a larger reservoir that reduce the frequency of syringe changes would be helpful in avoiding such complications.	3.777664587706327
This paper reviews respiratory muscle/circulation interaction in congestive heart failure.	2.5841863240993095
Respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure - generating capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients.	2.968436524852589
The mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented.	4.228892977140535
Not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients, but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation, such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	3.487293890544966
The underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed.	2.843056491211248
Traumatic, perilunate dislocations are rare lesions, and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures.	3.9688995090708734
Unfortunately, one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized, although conventional X-rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48% of cases, which can be improved by performing CT or bone scan in addition to 62% and 95%, repectively.	3.638762148789314
Forced extension seems to be the most frequent trauma mechanism.	4.245143981263901
The treatment consists of open reduction, predominantly of the lunate bone, and internal fixation.	3.9566935973164297
Huge carpal fragments such as the scaphoid and capitatum are ideally fixed by means of compression screws, while smaller fragments can only be aligned with Kirschner wires.	3.766846913802942
In cases of complex carpal instability supplementary stabilization may be achieved with an external fixator.	3.5722153417121696
The best results on the Martini evaluation score were achieved in simple perilunate dislocations that were reset early by open surgical procedures and were accompanied by minimal involvement of/damage to different tissues.	2.8970016770919966
Although we had a nonunion rate of approximately 20% in our series of 11 mixed traumatized patients in all, the Martini classification of hand function seems to be a reliable score system for practical clinical follow-ups.	3.5414350564913244
Maternal anxiety in the event of a false positive result is an argument against universal hearing screening in newborns.	3.243381426195781
The aim of this study was to investigate the mothers' attitudes towards neonatal hearing screening and their anxiety in case of a positive result.	3.1717738464215475
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN-) were both administered subcutaneously (SC) in combination with intravenously (IV) applied 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma (RCC).	3.7951704888660944
The IFN- was given in each of the 8 weeks (6-9 MU/m2 once to three times weekly SC) combined sequentially with IL-2 (5-20 MU/m2 three times weekly SC for 4 weeks) and 5-FU (750 mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks).	3.9909435821716004
Among the 30 consecutive patients treated, in 2 cases a complete, and in 9 cases a partial, remission was achieved in patients with mostly lung and skeletal metastases, with an overall objective response rate of 37 %.	4.065716428992366
Mean response duration was 8 months (range 3-18 months).	3.5356236698004717
A stable state of the disease lasting 3-18 months was observed in 10 cases.	5.15186766296043
The side effects were only slight and corresponded to toxicity grade I (n = 2), grade II (n = 22) and grade III (n = 6), according to the WHO classification.	4.108643217925268
In conclusion, this triple-drug biochemotherapy demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness comparable with that of an aggressive IL-2 treatment regimen (applied IV), but without its high toxicity.	3.4280172882040465
Compression therapy was employed for 4 weeks 20 patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage CVI I and CVI II according to Widmer's classification.	3.813366404872346
Compression bandaging for 2 weeks was followed by compression stockings for 2 more weeks.	3.159833791635419
The cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated before therapy, after 2 weeks and after finishing compression therapy after 4 weeks.	3.3453645722262544
Marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after 4 weeks, along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume.	3.75259663213396
Video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and pericapillary halo diameter.	3.7695744078025637
Compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation.	4.033621924955715
The efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar.	2.7417935978216352
The splanchnic perfusion is reduced early in the course of any shock.	3.7288857337154466
The mucosa of the gut suffers most as it experiences a high oxygen demand even in the steady state.	3.4441414926778218
The specific arrangement of the micro vessels within the villus of the mucosa exposes the tip of the villus at the highest risk for ischemia, particularly in low flow states.	3.177183291699846
As a consequence the integrity of the mucosal layer is compromised and dysfunction of the mucosal barrier may allow bacteria and toxins to translocate from the gut lumen.	3.040518721510974
Activation of leukocytes and stimulation of cytokine synthesis may comprise a sustained inflammatory response syndrome.	3.2458371309432286
So far there is a good body of evidence that the splanchnic region may play an important role in the pathophysiological sequence from shock to organ dysfunction.	3.5581539595595744
As pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current, the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current.	3.130972727632259
Whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow-up, was studied in 87 patients who received the VDD-single lead UniPass 425 connected to the pacemaker Unity (Sulzer Intermedics).	3.094381677927766
The impedance changes between implantation and 6 months follow-up were assessed for each patient.	4.002082313097242
Similar impedance values were defined, if the two measurements were within a range <= -100 to +100 .	3.6734525991249427
Six-months impedance was lower or higher compared to implantation, if the difference exceeded > -100 or > +100 .	3.46919880844144
At implantation, impedance was 535  +/-  98  (range: 333-811 ) and significantly increased to 604  +/-  160  (range: 361-1150 ) after 6 months.	2.834111042570497
Similar impedance had 43 (implantation: 527  +/-  75 , 6 months: 531  +/-  87 ), lower values 11 (implantation: 660  +/-  83 , 6 months: 494  +/-  73 ) and higher values 33 patients (implantation: 503  +/-  99 , 6 months: 735  +/-  168 ).	3.030815589579278
Compared to the patients with similar impedance patients with lower impedance had a significantly higher impedance values at implantation.	3.829557314755036
Conclusions: Pacing impedance increased significantly within 6 months after implantation.	3.1631747315128567
Pacing impedance changed > 100  in 51% of the patients.	3.767107196555961
The long-term follow-up of pacing impedance can be predicted generally, but not for the individual patient.	3.4036024784305074
Endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis.	3.235499453800091
The aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) release following a local endothelial injury during PTCA (group A) and after sustained myocardial ischemia (group B).	3.2777556685975435
Additionally, the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed.	2.997250180911224
Since first described in the early 1990s, coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has evolved as a promising noninvasive modality for imaging of the coronary arteries and evaluation of coronary artery disease.	3.8270469209606297
Despite technical limitations, coronary MRA has established value for imaging of anomalous coronary artery and assessment of bypass graft patency.	3.521561586132259
Current research focuses on the development of optimal respiratory compensation strategies, improved spatial and temporal resolution and faster acquisition of image data.	3.5422031705202284
The accurate detection of stenoses and assessment of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis is presently being evaluated with large multicenter studies.	4.134343525178539
With further technique enhancements and more clinical experience, coronary MRA is likely to become the dominant noninvasive modality in clinical cardiology.	3.360393234777824
Which consequences can be ascribed to the intraarticular position of devices in the operative treatment of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis?	3.4175322672998822
Which steps are to define as a standard of a careful procedure?	4.416516375460069
A digitised three-dimensional (3-D) image of the face has many valuable uses.	4.517687954311012
These include accurate measurements of facial morphology, clinical documentation and objective analyses of surgical procedures.	3.2424284080563006
A new system presented here, based on stereophotogrammetric techniques, instantaneously captures digitised images using high-resolution cameras.	3.38666764994127
It has an accuracy of more than 0.5 mm RMS and creates the 3-D image from approximately 20,000 points.	3.2495180488020248
The principles of the image capturing are demonstrated and the potential uses discussed.	3.154898907745402
This new capturing and measurement system provides a simple method of determining 3-D changes in soft tissue following surgery and is a useful tool for clinical purposes.	3.550975630679948
A potential impact of tricyclic antidepressants on oral anticoagulation is controversial.	2.7931208986518703
Phenprocoumon - the most commonly used anticoagulant in Germany - is rarely considered in clinical trials.	3.833750699622024
In the present study, a potential drug-drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics, causing an alteration in prothrombinemic effects, has been investigated.	3.0165334867178064
To analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments, especially the disc, after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with AO internal fixator, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the traumatised region after implant removal.	3.524245410758973
There were two aspects of disc degeneration (DD): (1) biochemical changes and (2) structural damage.	3.676329574332335
MRI detects biochemical processes as one aspect of DD that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture.	3.380143473755151
We observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture-adjacent discs and alterations of discal shape more often in the upper of the two, whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree.	3.8076048318741225
The supporters of upper-disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage, such as alteration of shape and loss of height (altogether more frequent in the upper disc).	3.4381797558891827
Our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation.	2.9242805286999825
With regard to the upper disc, the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised.	3.6701945986200974
The question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone.	3.5101751685103206
Besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by MRI, a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions.	3.8042966097719972
To study the frequency and clinical aspects of cold urticaria in Central Europe, patient data from a university dermatology clinic and a private dermatology office between 1984-94 were analysed and the patients reexamined if possible.	3.485367357298682
The incidence of cold urticaria was found to be 0.05%.	3.547833674737691
Of the 56 patients with cold urticaria (31 women, 25 men), 49 had idiopathic cold urticaria.	3.070761497573613
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 year, the mean duration of disease 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.	3.516759328238283
Atopy was found in 46.5% of patients, and 23.2% of the patients suffered from other types of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced).	3.9360830000158185
Laboratory examinations were only rarely abnormal.	3.5593400659248453
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with generally only moderate symptomatic improvement.	4.030158532054034
Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin, 1-2 mil IU/d over 2-4 weeks, n=18, or tetracyclines, 2 g/d over 2 weeks, n=10) induced full remission in 13 patients and symptomatic improvement in 8.	3.625352225286148
During an average of 6.5 year-follow-up, 20 of 43 symptomatic patients went into spontaneous remission.	3.725108825804313
The good therapeutic response to antibiotics in this study underlines the need for a better elucidation of the cause of cold urticaria, in view of possible infectious causes.	4.143958497135606
Background: Since its first implantation as an eyeball replacement in the United States in 1985, hydroxyapatite has been rarely used as an orbital implant in Germany.	3.277513489842595
The aim of the study was to collect data on long-term tolerance, postoperative complications and the cosmetic end results.	3.203128833056976
A 37-year-old woman had intensive care for 105 days and artificial ventilation for 72 days because of a lung transplantation and multiple postoperative complications.	3.493958919627383
She developed severe heterotopic ossification of both shoulders, the right elbow and both hip joints.	3.1546030821882285
Owing to complete joint stiffness, she was immobilized and unable to eat or drink without help.	2.8200340075787502
Operative treatment was performed in two procedures.	3.428112790919316
The right shoulder and right elbow were operated on first; the right hip and later the left hip were operated on after recovery from the previous surgical procedures.	3.5929924848637174
After 22 months, there was a good functional result; the patient took part in all activities of daily life and was pain-free.	3.872437541573153
The present knowledge on heterotopic ossifications is summarized, as well as possible prophylactic measurements.	3.3343636921811877
Background: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is one of the most common forms of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population.	3.1393397565778782
Patients and methods: 41 children with a mean age of 9.6 (3.7-16) years with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) refractory to medical treatment (n=38) and recurrent syncope (n=3) underwent electrophysiologic (EP) study.	2.9875469287787846
In all patients dual AV-nodal physiology could be demonstrated during EP study and typical form of AVNRT (mean heart rate 220/min) could be induced by programmed atrial stimulation.	3.3196877356263097
A steerable 7 F ablation catheter was placed at the inferoparaseptal region of the tricupid valve annulus close to the orifice of the coronary sinus with the intention to record a late fractionated local atrial electrogram during sinus rhythm.	3.3637226668976514
Starting at this point radiofrequency current (500 kHz) with a target temperature of 70 °C was delivered with the intention to ablate the slow pathway.	3.5476845692147996
If a slowly accelerated junctional rhythm (<120/min) occurred during energy discharge, programmed atrial stimulation was repeated.	3.2700804755083195
Otherwise radiofrequency current was delivered step by step up to a septal position next to the tricuspid valve annulus.	3.163191350367434
Slow pathway ablation was defined as lack of evidence of dual AV nodal pathways during repeated atrial stimulation.	3.2551037790145516
Slow pathway modulation was defined as maximal one atrial echoimpulse after ablation.	3.1447090984424793
Results: The number of energy applications ranged from 1-19 (median 6).	3.471631992344439
In 35/41 patients slow pathway ablation could be achieved; in six patients the slow pathway was modulated.	3.394613187705684
In none of the patients permanent high grade AV block was observed.	4.061042871338654
During follow-up (mean 4.1 years) two patients had a recurrent episode of AVNRT after slow pathway modulation.	3.4877698179715604
All other patients are still free of AVNRT without medical treatment.	3.1164561298569224
Conclusion: Selective radiofrequency current ablation/modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of AVNRT in young patients.	3.213528034114103
All operations were carried out by the first author in succession using the same operative technique.	3.812942710656955
The two groups did not differ in age, BMI, operative time, weight of resected tissue or preoperative laboratory.	3.4406733286824034
Blood loss was calculated from the perioperative drop in hemoglobin and patient's blood volume.	3.330932145065109
Blood pressure, heart rate, medication and intravenous fluid supply were obtained from the anesthetic protocols.	3.5374244165919104
Results (means and standard deviations): Group I (n = 28) and [Group II (n = 28)]: total resected tissue 1862  +/-  928 g [1912  +/-  791 g]; Hb-preop.	2.919897805990744
13.6  +/-  0.9 g/dl [13.8  +/-  0.8 g/dl]; Hb-postop.	3.8898616680409517
10.8  +/-  1.3 g/dl [9.7  +/-  1.3 g/dl] P = 0.006; Blood loss 970  +/-  339 ml [1443  +/-  456 ml] P < 0.001.	2.7367452545256326
After exclusion of surgical or biological causes hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic techniques were suspected as the reason for the significant difference in blood loss.	3.781946331286852
MAP was elevated only initially, while the heart rate was considerably elevated throughout the procedures in group II.	4.1753231002018545
During anesthesia with nitrous oxide and enflurane, the dose of enflurane in group I could be limited to 0.3-0.5 % after initial i. v. administration of 60 to 100 µg sufentanil, while in group II without opioids doses of 0.5-2 % were required.	3.5778698405507345
The well-known dose-dependend effect of enflurane on the peripheral vascular tone was not masked by vasoconstrictors at the operative site.	3.2112740555042616
Conclusions: Blood loss during mammaplasties can be affected considerably by the anaesthetic technique - even without deliberate hypotension.	3.0764487270956007
Sufentanil can indirectly reduce the blood loss by lowering the necessary dose of enflurane.	3.7079895653235377
Blood transfusions can be avoided at mammaplasties.	3.468168017378832
Continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine with the opioid fentanyl represents an effective analgesic method in the therapy of strong postoperative pain after major surgery.	3.6965877654585073
Preparation of the required infusion solution in syringes with a volume of 50 ml immediately prior to administration is routinely performed by nursing staff in Germany.	3.0880679493823857
The preparation of a mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% in 250 ml infusion bags at the pharmacy of the University Hospital Mainz is described.	2.6680286890608045
To determine the physicochemical stability, the concentration of bupivacaine-HCl and fentanyl was assessed using HPLC over a period of 32 days; in addition the pH values were determined.	3.2700341324023854
After 32 days 95% of the bupivacaine hydrochloride and fentanyl baseline values were recorded.	3.210166014738792
The pH baseline value had decreased from 5.48-5.52 to 0.5-0.7 units.	2.828879389199021
The measured values confirm the physicochemical stability of the mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% over a period of 32 days.	2.757205261428262
The infusion bag can be stored for 4 weeks at room temperature.	3.326331496728634
The programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult, especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory loudness (MAL) needs to be determined.	3.189661614913451
Excessively high stimulation should be avoided as this can have a traumatic effect.	3.725157913213314
The aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold (ESRT) and the postoperatively determined MAL and hearing threshold for 27 patients, each having one of three implant types.	2.762740121428057
The question of whether the ESRT provides a practical technique to simplify, improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated.	2.6041312091052013
For the monopolar stimulation mode used for the Med-El and Clarion implant systems, the average MAL and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average ESRT across all electrodes.	3.101620201707193
For the "common ground" stimulation mode used for the Nucleus implant system, a parabolic transformation was used to relate MAL and ESRT to one another.	3.1283464849178517
These transformations between MAL values calculated from the ESRT and the actual MAL values, determined psychoacoustically, diverged considerably from one another.	3.0049257245328893
Therefore, it was not possible to determine the MAL from the ESRT with certainty.	3.8601923235572415
The ESRT does, however, provide a means to estimate an approximate upper boundary for the MAL, apart from its use to control implant function.	3.4493827736444165
The determination of the exact MAL will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques.	3.6451136777235273
Movements and vibrations of intraocular structures can be observed during vitrectomy with mechanical cutting systems.	3.3792008623075294
We experimentally compared these intraocular motion artifacts between mechanical and erbium:YAG laser vitrectomy.	2.8656645212257423
Spontaneous rupture und false aneurysms of the non-arteriosclerotic aorta are rare.	3.3766392598883783
We report on a 53-year-old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by semicircumferential aortic end-to-end anastomosis.	2.81221401848979
After 6 months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft, transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch.	3.065552924255145
The iliac reconstruction was performed by PTFE interposition.	4.083132469050136
There was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis.	3.1636464974364373
At 1 year follow-up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms.	5.08057400286391
In this biomechanical study the implanted Unreamed Humeral Nail (UHN) has been tested concerning bending and torsional stiffnesses.	3.104629804843364
In literature other intramedullary implants have been critisized for insufficient rotatory stability especially in transverse and short oblique fractures of the humeral shaft.	3.1078496742687416
This study examined, whether the implanted UHN, as well as the UHN implanted with interfragmentary compression through a specific compression device, is able to augment torsional stiffness significantly.	3.427631157945852
To evaluate bending and torsional stiffnesses, the UHN has been compared biomechanically to the Russell-Taylor humeral nail (RT) in paired mid-shaft osteotomized cadaveric humeri.	2.5601170482645297
Identic paired comparison has been performed with the UHN without and UHN with interfragmentary compression.	3.4415703577053125
In anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction stiffness under four-point-bending is significantly higher in stabilizing with the RT.	2.9659987581503855
Under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm and 8 Nm the UHN reached more than the double torsional stiffness.	2.622301892206734
The RT, which is only dynamically interlocked, owns a high initial "play" between bolts and nail itself.	3.315825090981834
Through additional interfragmentary compression stiffness of the UHN under four-point-bending in anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction augments significantly.	2.6786596902675335
Also under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm und 8 Nm torsional stiffness increases with interfragmentary compression significantly.	2.432286127437203
In comparison to other biomechanical studies of different autorship it is clear, that this statically interlocked intramedullary nailing of the humeral shaft is superior to non-statically interlocked types of nailing concerning their stabilizing potency in torsion and serves especially for fracture types, which are critically under rotation, as transverse or short oblique humeral shaft fractures.	3.176645587967887
While the different national health systems merge structurally, cost expansion in health care is a global challenge.	3.0506558538968043
Structural reforms have been developed during recent years in the USA which can be summarized as "managed care".	4.325772843115148
They are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system, in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economical goods.	3.7273229666476726
In managed-care models, patients are deliberately directed to the most economic forms of therapy.	3.7715981590251
The spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines, which lead to a standardization of processes.	3.5403220061083256
Financing and medical executive responsibilities fuse.	3.428951209989618
The autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to enforce an integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system.	3.0966009277055004
Leadership is no longer primarily confined to doctors or scientists.	3.667022993615079
It is progressively shifting to financing institutions, managing directors or insurance companies.	2.6839086772259977
Structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the U. S. and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs.	2.651868945751232
Nevertheless, the US model is still far more expensive compared to the German system.	3.730708236322786
Historical development, current concepts of US-managed care, its potential influence and general applicability to the German situation are discussed in an overview.	3.8260771145831183
On the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy, and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis.	3.6393599130326226
In the early 1980s, a peptide that caused diuresis, natriuresis, and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups.	2.88535323551297
This was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides, followed by the characterisation of the amino-acid sequences of several species.	3.2963029427241746
Synthesis of the peptide, cloning of the encoding gene, identification and characterisation of specific receptors, as well as the development of antibodies and radioimmunoassays were rapidly accomplished.	3.5339671611394134
Research on the immunohistochemistry of cardiodilatin/atrial natriuretic peptide (CDD/ANP) and the regulation of CDD/ANP gene expression led to detection of the peptide in extra-atrial tissues.	3.39842681972704
Later on, two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).	3.0810315586107797
These peptides share structural features with CDD/ANP with regard to their 17-amino-acid-exhibiting loop bridged by a disulfide bond.	3.0023353653430513
Another recently discovered peptide is urodilatin (URO), a renal-borne new member of A-type natriuretic peptide.	3.2764841715143276
URO was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as CDD/ANP, containing the 17-amino-acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with 4 additional amino acids located at the NH2-terminus of the peptide.	3.1667486098946873
Regarding physiological actions, data strongly support a close association between URO and urinary sodium excretion.	2.995793869711311
The application of URO in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to CDD/ANP-99-126.	2.9759050184838713
These results were encouraging for the use of URO in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure (ARF) in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of incipient ARF in patients following liver transplantation.	3.9208461189075017
Summarising the results of these two studies, URO represents a new approach for not only prevention, but also for treatment of ARF following organ transplantation.	4.479482711691494
This opens up new possibilities for the treatment of ARF of other origins in intensive care medicine.	3.3428249259038827
Dermatomyositis in a 7 year old girl was diagnosed two months prior to admission to our pediatric rheumatology program.	3.578524897830624
Serological and molecular biology methods were used to investigate the evidence for a recent coxsackie-B-virusinfection.	4.216541050280596
Objectives Wide approach to the posterior aspect of the scapula for internal fixation of unstable fractures of neck of scapula and glenoid.	3.835628831251514
The guideline "Joint Swelling" is addressed to primary care physicians - general practitioners, internists or orthopedists without special experience in rheumatology.	2.8534956532321822
It provides a framework for interviewing patients, as well as for physical, laboratory and imaging examinations and for selection of treatment appropriate to the level of primary care.	3.907133629299594
Situations which call for urgent evaluation and criteria for referral to rheumatologists are described.	3.1270857918473696
Further recommendations for the evaluation of patient history and physical and technical examinations are given in a tabular form.	3.922297935199757
The significance of laboratory and imaging procedures is discussed.	3.118469053738692
Introduction: Bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy occur twice to three times more frequently than after an open procedure.	3.239734293550731
Four different types of lesions may be differentiated by the Siewert classification: postoperative bile fistulas (type I), late strictures (type II), tangential injuries of the bile duct (type III) and defect lesions (type IV).	3.5676363771351065
The diagnostic and therapeutic management is demonstrated in relation to our own experience and the literature.	4.976663776120737
Methods: Eleven patients (median age 43.8  +/-  17.2) with bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were operatively treated between November 1993 and December 1998.	2.966034302093586
Nine patients (four type-II lesions, five type-IV lesions) were referred from another hospital; 2 defect lesions out of 410 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (0.5 %) were documented in our own patient group.	3.155747935376467
Results: Four patients with late strictures were operatively treated with a hepaticocholedochostomy (n = 2) or hepaticojejunostomy (n = 2) after 14.3  +/-  8.4 months and were discharged from hospital after 10.6  +/-  3.8 days.	3.319145095396961
In both cases with type-IV lesion and a short defect, an end-to-end anastomosis was successful (hospital stay 11.6  +/-  1.0 days).	3.2339509466111025
However, a retrocolic Roux-Y end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy was perfomed in all cases with a larger defect (n = 5; hospital stay 14.8  +/-  2.0 days).	3.2970331178259378
The two defect lesions in our own group were detected by intraoperative cholangiography and immediately treated after conversion either with hepaticocholedocho-stomy or hepaticojejunostomy (hospital stay 11.2  +/-  0.6 days).	3.1081775759434844
Conclusions: The incidence of bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be kept down by anatomic preparation, selective intraoperative cholangiography and early consideration of conversion to open procedure.	3.011134219778615
The clinical course after biliary tract injury can be positively influenced only by a standard diagnostic and operative procedure and by an early transfer to a specialized center.	3.1986333394342403
In the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma diagnosis increased about 15-20 %.	3.654807752846408
The main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence.	3.588039447385621
In the present autopsy series comprising 23.801 autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1,77 % in Jena and 1,55 % in Königgrätz (200.000 inhabitants each).	3.2153061675567596
Over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased.	3.73409503976192
With the advent of atypical antipsychotics, quality of life for patients with schizophrenia has improved significantly.	3.8782694544671625
The positive effects are based not only on the compliance-enhancing reduction of extrapyramidal side effects but also due to improved cognitive function and social integration, shorter duration, and overall reduction of hospital treatment.	3.1469102312919146
The mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction is still high and according to recently published data amounts to 17 to 42%.	2.9556885140523366
In the seventies introduction of thrombolytic therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality of non-perioperative myocardial infarction.	3.7955898484037287
However, in the perioperative situation thrombolytic therapy remains to be problematic in most cases because of expected severe bleeding complications.	3.41192740443315
In the last 4-6 years acute-PTCA has been established in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction.	3.5109511835685
Up to date no data are available concerning the effect of acute-PTCA on mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	3.516057750637
Nevertheless it can be assumed, that acute-PTCA will lead to a considerable reduction in mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	3.820569712106583
Therefore, in patients with significant perioperative myocardial infarction immediate coronary angiography and, if indicated, acute-PTCA should be performed.	4.223673602668258
In principle, thrombolytic therapy is considered to be contraindicated in the intra- or postoperative situation.	3.55527323876719
However, if coronary angiography and PTCA are not possible, thrombolysis might be taken into consideration, in particular if the expected bleeding complications are small in relation to the expected benefit of thrombolysis.	3.8238342255030484
Since acute-PTCA has been shown to remarkably reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction, this group of patients should be especially considered.	4.4505083719429415
Medical theories and practices concerning illness and health in old age as well as several aspects of society that do influence the aging process are described from a historical perspective integrating classical antiquity, middle ages, and modern times.	3.2025661551377986
From the present state of research it is distinguished between "primary illnesses in old age" and chronical diseases which might principally also begin in younger ages but take a different course in old age.	3.046312651999557
Even if the frequency of disease and multimorbidity is increasing, negative stereotypes of the aging process have to be invalidated.	4.03537253531596
Advances in medical sciences are a good pre-condition for increasing physical and mental health in old age.	2.8477210051077964
The analysis of wall motion abnormalities with dobutamine stress echocardiography is an established method for the detection of myocardial ischemia.	3.653139825416992
With ultrafast magnetic resonance tomography, the application of identical stress protocols as used for echocardiography is possible.	3.563891477913911
Transvaginal ultrasound provides an early and accurate technique to assess first trimester pregnancy.	3.3287743244558383
Beginning with the demonstration of an intrauterine gestational sac, sonography enables further evaluation of normal pregnancy development, such as identification of the embryo, visualization of the yolk sac, and the presence of fetal cardiac activity as a reassurance of fetal viability.	3.8668676290316593
Furthermore it allows closed sonographic monitoring of early intrauterine pregnancy and distinction between normal and abnormal development of pregnancy.	3.1363525275726505
A prediction in terms of pregnancy outcome can be made regarding pregnancy complications or specific risks like vaginal bleeding, the demonstration of intrauterine hematoma, advanced maternal age, early growth delay or fetal bradycardia.	3.4404199140915974
A homogeneous strategy of intraoperative handling of the obstructed bowel (decompression, endoluminal splinting) as well as abdominal closure would be desirable.	3.3026895111205223
Adhesiolysis remains the most common procedure.	5.1983380980011855
Small bowel plication is still used by a minority of surgeons with the Noble's technique replaced by the Child-Phillips' technique and its modifications.	3.1694889049046395
However, as a result of the lack of controlled studies, there is no large body of evidence available to support the use of plication, long tubes or any other specific surgical intervention.	3.974414245848671
This is an important task for the future, especially in view of incidence and economic importance of small bowel-ileus.	4.760113022313198
Purpose: The purpose of our study was to determine the value of MRI in monitoring laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) of cerebral neoplasms.	2.910856897974995
A 70-year-old woman with severely symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was unresponsive to drug treatment.	3.085361133581783
She had recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and syncope and was at high risk for sudden death; a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator (DDD-ICS) was implanted.	3.1008301223758985
Her initial left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 80 mmHg and fell to 40 mmHg during dual-chamber pacing at an atrial ventricular delay of 140 ms.	3.051904441647629
In the follow-up over six months she was asymptomatic with respect to angina pectoris; ventricular tachycardias could be successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing or by shocks.	3.3262825616296827
A dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator is an important therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	4.136489041035863
Morbihan's disease was first reported as a distinct entity in 1957 by Degos, describing a chronic persistent erythema and oedema of the upper half of the face.	3.6975388304879746
Such conditions have been noted in the literature designated as chronic lymphoedema or solid persistent facial oedema in acne or rosacea.	3.49150157155413
The characteristic features are a chronic course, a typical clinical picture, lack of specific laboratory and histological findings and refractoriness to therapeutic measures.	4.090533837321697
Paediatric cardiac transplantation (pHTX) has gained widespread acceptance as a therapy in end-stage myocardial failure and some forms of congenital heart disease, particularly hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).	3.068459165099774
The major problems to the anaesthesiologist in these patients are induction of anaesthesia in infants with HLHS and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the early post-bypass period.	4.446494275667669
Objective: Thirty years ago, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was primarily developed for otherwise healthy individuals who experienced sudden cardiac arrest.	3.0975658325259285
Today, CPR is widely viewed as an emergency procedure that can be attempted on any person who undergoes a cessation of cardiorespiratory function.	3.285733067417834
Therefore, the appropriateness of CPR has been questioned as a matter of the outcome, the patient's preferences, and the cost.	4.5336026401280645
The objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital resuscitation.	2.8502431931974144
Arguments: CPR is bound by moral considerations that surround the use of any medical treatment.	3.347999607888877
According to Beauchamp and Childress, the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories, principles, rules, and particular judgements and actions.	2.6031049568765083
The decision to start CPR is based on the medical judgement that a person is suffering from circulatory arrest.	3.3014974156871197
Moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles.	3.8960325847127453
The principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare.	2.6847067743494546
Talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success, as many victims of pre- and in-hospital sudden death have been saved in the past.	3.4183468978840326
Nevertheless, resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases, involving the principle of nonmaleficence.	3.665986878954062
There is potential harm in CPR.	3.0821128949784002
Survivors may recover cardiac function, but sustain severe hypoxic brain damage, at worst surviving without awakening for months or years.	2.9397064196109155
In particular, post-traumatic CPR is associated with an extremely poor outcome, leading to the issue of futility.	3.9255243993938294
However, futility should be defined in a strict fashion, as there might be an individual chance of survival.	3.07036166053634
The principle of respect for autonomy means the right of a patient to accept or reject medical treatment, which continues in emergency conditions and after the patient has lost consciousness.	3.658497350127418
If the patient's wish's can be ascertained later on, life-sustaining therapies might be withdrawn at that time.	3.0390744399995406
Terminally ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no-CPR document, which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms, but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene.	3.1667251630951685
The principle of justice affects priorities in the allocation of health care resources.	2.862912556890815
The decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit.	3.2333578593169827
Conclusions: The standard of care remains the prompt initiation of CPR.	3.237245047138925
However, ethical principles such as beneficene, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine.	3.5005263494279957
Physicians have to consider the therapeutic efficacy of CPR, the potential risks, and the patient's preferences.	5.4486028635290715
Acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting-out.	3.6253232463337515
Subtile behaviour, too, as a part of the "complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals" (Sandler) which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting-out or microacting-out (Treuniet).	3.447954545910144
However, this delicate acting has no meaning, it is not symbolic or communicative action.	3.22454012636171
It is aimed at inducing effects and interactions.	3.185971007358206
It appears both on the side of the analyst and of the patient and is part of the unconscious communication in the therapeutic process.	5.017552844844989
Diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated, how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way.	3.2441018251487628
The acting-reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations, by which he unintentionally demonstrates, in what a way he understands the patient.	3.1458983916417744
Background: The therapy of phimosis is circumcision.	3.2977868650427054
Since many years it has been discussed, whether phimosis is treatable with local estrogen application analogous to the treatment of labial synechia in girls.	3.548253476817016
This conservative treatment depends on the presence of estrogen receptors (er-alpha) in male prepuce-cells.	3.553743026222148
Findings in previous investigations have indicated that contrast-enhanced colour Doppler can be used to improve the demonstration of characteristic features of neovascularization in malignancies.	3.590047275589106
However, the quantification of the increase in colour Doppler signals after Levovist in the cited study relied only on descriptive criteria defined by the investigator, resulting in a subjective scoring system.	3.0192253840439527
A computer-assisted method for quantitative analysis of colour pixel density is a novel approach for objective assessment of colour Doppler signal after contrast media administration.	3.2256616373295866
After microbubble contrast medium injection in 47 patients, carcinomas and benign lesions behaved differently regarding degree, onset and duration of Doppler enhancement.	3.208396971235719
However, the high interindividual variability and the temporal variations of the Doppler signal still limit the value of these criteria for prospective diagnosis.	3.6072446453900713
Rapid image-acquisition techniques are needed in order to apply the necessary mathematical processing before the contrast kinetics can be used for diagnostic purposes.	3.9302913961191406
Recent studies have shown that increased intraocular pressure following keratoplasty may cause progressive endothelial cell loss and thereby lead to early transplant failure.	2.843501636866829
This study examined risk groups for development of postoperative glaucoma and thereby transplant failure.	2.8974610626106174
Dysphagia is a common complaint following surgical intervention in the oral cavity and hypopharynx, often leading to prolonged postoperative recovery.	3.5735640906558404
Videofluoroscopy allows detailed visualization of deglutition, demonstrating the morphology as well as the functional aspects.	3.731206353376379
Therefore, videofluoroscopy provides the basis for further therapeutic management.	3.511606810696004
We discuss the pathology of deglutition in 19 patients recovering from tumor surgery of the oro- and hypopharynx.	3.3556880646275635
In most cases the results demonstrated severe impairment of both the oral and pharyngeal phase of deglutition.	3.3885139945870923
Our data emphasize the importance of the oral phase of deglutition for preparation and initiation of the following phases.	4.328228553428348
People who suffer a stroke most often experience a major crisis in their lives.	3.0842836749909153
This leads to psychological problems which are likely to influence the patient's life satisfaction, long-term rehabilitation outcome, and quality of life as much as the physical consequences caused by the stroke.	3.8901617845190315
The patient's ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential.	3.454563717716527
This necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process, which unfolds in the same way as other experiences of vital threat, e.g.	3.277061521543103
confrontation with one's own dying.	3.5637356565659943
Different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are nonacceptance of the facts, erupting emotions, parting with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one's future.	3.675394056390614
Whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages, but essentially on their persistence.	3.256650923093543
It is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior, stage-consistent interventions and a positive feedback.	3.0578613688790206
A failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having sufferd a stroke.	4.078186025558648
A 63-year-old woman developed a pruritic exanthema on the extremities after one hour of work in her garden pond in Planegg, Southern Bavaria.	2.828749762372967
As the appropriate vectors (ducks and snails) were present, we made the tentative diagnosis of cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch).	2.8871920232708375
By different serological methods (cercarial fluorescent antibody test, cercarial Hüllen reaction, circumoval precipitin test) antibodies against cercariae could be demonstrated in the serum of the patient 14 days later.	3.3433541033058143
Cercarial dermatitis appears worldwide, but in Central Europe the disease is often not recognized.	4.394153735078134
The current adjustment of cochlear implant (CI) speech processors is based on a knowledge of the lower and upper limits (T- and C-levels) for electrical stimulus currents.	3.6619689320734885
These data are usually acquired from subjective classifications of individual patients.	2.8660289536470933
In cases with non-reliable patient responses, objective methods are necessary.	2.9813720174628684
Especially for the estimation of correct T-levels, auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be applied, since they allow the determination of response thresholds in a frequency-specific manner.	3.739064975899097
By determining the AEP of different latencies, late cortical responses can be registered almost without artifact contamination.	2.8187389063667863
These patients have been examined in 20 patients provided with 22- or 8-channel CI-systems (Nucleus or Med-El implants).	3.4480032822120856
By making use of acoustical stimulation in a free sound field, subjective hearing threshold and the T-levels of electrical stimulation could be verified.	3.2394939377154537
Since late responses are generated in the primary auditory cortex, their assessment permits a nearly integral functional control of the aided hearing system.	3.2953482710978927
To date, no problems have occured from maturation or attentional effects in either pediatric or adult patients.	2.789327466154163
The applicability in very young children remains to be explored.	3.2683335652636205
Laparoscopic gastric banding has become a common procedure in bariatric surgery.	3.611550025869831
Early as well as late complications are, in comparison to conventional techniques, rare.	5.062992361239395
Complications arising from the operative technique are: perforation, early pouch dilatation, gastric slippage, infections of the port and the band, erosion and defects of the band tube.	3.448046653764409
Insufficient weight loss and late pouch dilatation arise from unsatisfactory compliance on the part of the patient.	3.5315983952333627
In 7.5 % of 146 cases, reoperations were necessary.	3.1785856626688576
Obstruction of the pouch stoma and a slippage resulted in total food intolerance.	3.3339389329533025
After radiologic diagnosis the band system should be deflated first and a naso-gastric tube applied.	2.993182152494938
If this does not result in the pouch collapsing, a revision operation is needed.	3.7955645053315306
The significant legal and ecomonic ramifications of a positive drug test produce an incentive among users of illicit drugs to escape detection.	2.846743088043488
Therefore, being the easiest body fluid to handle for drug screening urine is very often manipulated to test clean.	2.883321690949903
Methods available to cause a negative result range from substitution of urine, adulteration of the collected specimen by various chemical agents and in-vivo manipulations.	3.2043974500974386
Among these, the preferred strategy is to increase fluid intake and urine flow so as to dilute the concentration of drugs below the threshold of detection.	3.252181837032739
Based on data from uncontrolled and controlled fluid intake studies in the literature and physiological conditions of urinary excretion, the meaningfulness of creatinine concentration in randomly obtained urine samples is discussed.	3.1086955233893008
A low creatinine concentration not clearly proving an intentional dilution of the sample, the application of GC/MS analysis or the concentration of the urine prior to drug screening is recommended for specimens exhibiting a "suspect" urinary creatinine concentration.	3.3678456723915193
Goal: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has a key role within the neuromonitoring, although ICP does not monitor processes of the central neuron directly and only with delay.	3.247870063793031
One of the important factors in ICP monitoring is measurement accuracy.	3.1749562061359784
For a better understanding of ICP probes and their differences, the function and principles of intracranial pressure transducers should be evaluated from a technical point of view.	3.2292807146405074
The therapy for spontaneous or artificial perforation of the esophagus remains a controversial matter.	3.3736096307915666
The following case report deals with the medical history of an artificial esophageal perforation after operative treatment of cervical disc disease.	3.595006597018067
A 68-year-old male patient underwent a C4/C5 and C5/C6 discectomy with interbody fusion of C7-T1 vertebral body, according to Smith-Robinson.	2.9121638561098657
During this operation, a 3-cm-long lesion was made in the posterior wall of the esophagus, which was treated 24 h later with a primary suture.	4.2063745306098435
The clinical follow-up was complicated by mediastinitis with subsequent multiorgan failure.	3.0615710078199863
After recovery from this critical condition the patient complained of severe dysphagia, which was related to a persistent lesion in the posterior esophageal wall with endoscopically demonstrated dislocation of a screw.	3.7526418110565993
After removal of the screw, the lesion was covered by means of sternocleidomastoid myoplasty.	4.397850537607206
Moderate postoperative dysphagia was successfully treated by bougienage.	3.7436983482607737
Introduction: The loss of functional capacity by peripheral nerve lesion is easy to be estimated: A certain neurologic dysfunction results in a characteristic reduction of the former individual capacity.	3.8355007602381574
In contrast, the effect of accompanying pain to every-day life and working ability is not known exactly.	3.362607108532199
In this study, we compared the results of judgement in nerve lesions under the circumstances of additional pain syndromes.	3.293088355282177
The guidelines of the International Union against Cancer are generally used to assess malignancy of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.	3.8025023439435963
Beside TNM-staging, histological grading is performed.	3.295183385815861
This system has been extended by a selection of histological parameters which were studied with respect to prognosis, based on a review of 184 patients with squamous cell carcinoma.	4.121072877168799
An increased malignancy was found in carcinomas with the following features: clinical diameter greater than 2 cm, low degree of keratinization, high degree of cellular polymorphism, high mitotic index and high tumor thickness index (metastases only from tumor thickness 2,4 mm and subcutaneous infiltration), desmoplasia and ulceration.	3.1311940529555495
Consideration of histological tumor parameters improved prognosis assessment.	3.2020237064933283
Multivariate analyses with large case series are necessary to determine ranks of the prognostic factors.	3.377157402879843
Therefore, the data analysis of all centers that contribute to the carcinoma registry will make a precise difinition of high- and low-risk carcinomas possible and can thus influence therapy and follow-up procedures.	3.7196980462668443
Surgical closure of atrial septal defects can nowadays be performed without preoperative cardiac catheterization.	3.1785355122851837
For a transcatheter closure, however, x-ray exposure has been indispensable.	4.030529520617642
We report a closure of an atrial septal defect under transesophageal echocardiography without fluoroscopy.	2.677993588062668
In field research, training intensity was tested during three different dances by recording the exercise heart rates.	3.0056996870236516
The subjects (twelve women from 59 to 77 years old) were tested once a week three times, over three minutes with a break of three minutes, three weeks in all.	3.135447994444574
The sequence of the dances changed every week.	3.297245638069296
Measurement of baroreflex sensitivity is a new method to identify patients after myocardial infarction with a high risk for sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.	3.9971989944461654
In this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a FINAPRES-device and correlating this with the R-R intervals of the ECG after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of Norfenefrinhydrochlorid (Novadral).	3.0765253435924964
According to other investigators a correlation of >0.7 with a significance of p<0.05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity <3 ms/mm Hg being judged as decreased.	2.9029490629478274
We investigated 302 patients (mean age 59 +/- 17 years, 224 males, 78 females).	3.093702786930044
75% of the investigations showed acceptable results.	3.1985834787157916
In 77 cases (25%) reasonable results could not be achieved.	3.7374741063072516
We found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in 18 investigations (6% of all investigations).	3.4317667755615364
41 (13.1%) of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason.	3.3228579789356996
When we looked closely at these nonevaluable results, we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%), diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group.	4.009037982884058
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina.	3.0900453034027375
Only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix, where they are most commonly seen in adolescence.	4.053219093694098
Their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.	4.588776543806903
We report a case of cervical embryonal rhabdomysarcoma in IRS stage Ia in a 32-year-old female.	2.711540151268353
After surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months.	3.730133540786409
The case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features, and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed.	3.873891592447338
Between 1987 and 1993, 41 grade 3B open tibial shaft fractures were treated with the unreamed tibial nail (URTN n = 22) or an external fixator (FIX n = 19).	3.2296276623109708
The method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon.	3.917782464420844
Three below the knee amputations were performed, three patients died, and three were lost to follow-up.	3.6677142858357192
In all, 32 patients were followed up to union or at least for 1 year.	3.7775482736294137
There were no significant statistical differences between the two groups (P<0.2, chi-squared, t-test) with respect to fracture type, fracture location, age, gender or accompanying injuries.	3.092578552777375
The URTN group showed significantly better results regarding time to full weight-bearing (URTN 11 +/- 4 weeks; FIX 20 +/- 11 weeks, P<0.01 M-W) Mann-Whitney Test, number of reoperations (URTN 1.04; FIX 2.89; P<0.01 M-W), isolated bone grafting (URTN 3/22; FIX 8/19; P<0.05 chi-squared), and average Karlström and Olerud score (URTN 30 +/- 4; FIX 26 +/- 5; P<0.05 M-W).	3.3023363966182058
In all, 15/17 URTN patients and only 6/15 FIX patients achieved unlimited walking distance (P<0.01 M-W).	2.7639342408319707
Time to bony union, infection, and nonunion were not significantly different between groups.	3.2598248836308996
By varying the light spectrum, impulse length, impulse sequences and fluences, the PhotoDermVL allows a large choice of individual treatment parameters.	2.999779701362203
Superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations (essential telangiectases, port-wine stains, Poikiloderma of Civatte, hemangiomatous malformations) and cosmetically bothering hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity polychromatic pulsed light source.	3.0762136535736886
Catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.	3.398012533253888
With catheter ablation AV-block III °, pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade (in some cases followed by death), arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described.	3.8817733960856873
Especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients.	3.5236256692423287
On the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown.	3.8188481065587623
The risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after mayocardial infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease.	3.641174614696864
It is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.	3.9795793847652696
Background: Chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea.	3.6005811908136014
The appearance of corneal changes does not seem to be related to dose and duration of treatment.	3.515313744573961
The purpose of this study was to investigate microscopic changes of corneal morphology in patients treated with chloroquine in vivo.	2.800542055872495
Dermatological rehabilitation treatment can take different forms: climato-therapy, baths, phototherapy and psychosomatic treatments.	3.0486381370153244
Which of these treatments is of most benefit to any one patient depends on his or her illness.	3.4406287487359375
Accordingly, a psychosomatic approach to dermatological illness is indicated mainly when a psychological disorder and a dermatological disease coincide.	2.835684058918205
In addtion, dermatoses with psychological triggers or overlays, and also depression, pre-existing emotional disorders and special motivation for psychotherapy should be considered for psychosomatic treatment.	3.744539927630854
Finally, patients who are having trouble accepting or confronting malignant skin tumours may also benefit.	3.183596012170721
We report about the possibility of electrophysiological diagnosis and therapy in the treatment of a symptomatic left ventricular tachycardia which could not be treated effectively by oral medical therapy in a 10 year old boy with no obvious structural heart disease.	4.22897707517858
By right bundle-bloc-like QRS-complexes in the surface-ECG, the diagnosis of the ventricular origin of the tachycardia was confirmed by transesophageal-ECG.	3.9787697870983108
This was followed by the first electrophysiological examination that showed increased leftventricular vulnerability.	3.640409352653084
During this electrophysiological examination the tachycardia was terminated by stimulated singular premature beats.	2.9072065538033254
An oral medical therapy with sotalol was started.	3.2800229293171954
After the phase of saturation the next ventricular stimulation was done, that showed no sufficient protection of sotalol against VT.	3.187304317014427
So the decision was made for ventricular ablation.	3.4416339149510407
After 5 high frequency-applications no furhter ventricular tachycardia could be induced.	3.122319433943294
Since this intervention the patient lives without symptoms.	3.209465522565188
The vertebral bodies and vertebral arches show a characteristic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone.	3.0764264983958793
The pedicles are loaded by uniplanar bending that is reflected by the arrangement of the Corticalis.	2.978054709911963
The ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and (with exception of the lig.	3.576816459709491
longitudinale anterius) horizontal/oblique segmental ligament bundles.	3.045094558853861
In combination with the anulus fibrosus, the ligaments work as a kind of gear system.	3.0605104487164465
They regulate the process of movements of adjactent vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion.	3.6086069768310876
Besides maintaining the necessary amount of pretension the intervertebral disc distributes the loads uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies.	2.788940748548576
The intervertebral joints are important for guided motion, by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions.	3.226892617556468
Because of their position, they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes.	3.236150470307122
The integrity of the fascia thoracolumbalis warrants the protective function of the autochthonuos muscles.	3.347381688214552
Prolonged immobilization or physical inactivity has been shown to produce increased bone resorption due to enhanced osteoclastic activity and diminished bone formation.	3.0336032209721377
These skeletal changes are a typical complication in tetraplegic patients, who are at risk of developing hypocalcemia.	3.897191766798441
Hypercalciuria is the most characteristic symptom.	4.818670583655489
Risk factors for development of malignant melanoma have been investigated in several case control studies during the last decade, with some variation in results, partly with geographical region.	3.518154643989565
Four studies have been conducted under the auspices of the Central Malignant Melanoma Registry of the German Dermatological Society; these have yielded consistent results allowing the identification of risk factors for melanoma development.	3.230278926761742
The numbers of common melanocytic naevi, of atypical melanocytic naevi and the frequency of actinic lentigines were found by multivariate regression analysis to be the most important independent risk factors for melanoma development.	3.7232981889272683
Additional factors were hair colour, skin type and a history of naevus growth.	3.5479628674160906
A classification of relative risks was established by considering the first three risk factors mentioned, without any clear improvement of classification when further additional significant factors were taken into accout.	3.2425383215395835
For example, in individuals with more than 50 common melanocytic naevi, 5 or more atypical melanocytic naevi and simultaneous presence of actinic lentigines the risk of developing melanoma was found to be 100-fold that in persons with 10 common melanocytic naevi or fewer and without atypical melanocytic naevi or actinic lentigines.	3.4481193237995087
Early recognition of melanomas may be substantially improved if these risk factors are considered.	3.31455820210766
Problem: Clinical and ultrasound data of neonatal hips were analysed to answer the question whether a neonatal screening is necessary or not.	2.9902639854322035
Method: Children born between 1.	3.5672739618786347
1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound.	3.8433928667549657
The data were analysed by SPSS/PC.	2.939651932448604
Results: 5069 children with 10 138 hips were examined.	3.2046115993778352
The comparison shows, that from 119 hips with pathological ultrasound findings only 44 (37 %) had positive clinical findings.	2.921516379604554
A screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors (positive family history or breech position) would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time.	3.351563029223726
The interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) structures of the coronary tree and the myocardium by a clinician demands a subjective visual integration of two-dimensional (2D) images of cardiac diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy.	3.439656112326143
Although in the conventional analysis of 2D display scintigraphic myocardial perfusion segments are arbitrarily assigned to three major coronary artery systems, the standard myocardial perfusion distribution territories correspond with the individual pathologic-anatomic coronary tree in only 50-60% of the patients.	3.071116741701302
Hence, the mental integration ob both 2D images of coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy does not necessarily allow an accurate assignment of particular myocardial perfusion regions to the corresponding vessels.	2.945869019147684
For an objective assignment of each vessel segment of the coronary tree to the corresponding myocardial regions, we have developed a 3D "fusion image" technique and applied it to patients with coronary artery disease.	3.6170305486609577
Cause-and-effect relationships may be more obvious with 3D data fusion and may enable an easier comparison of anatomy and physiology.	3.25889719618846
The physician's duty of professional discretion is one of the basic tenets at the heart of the doctor's profession.	3.567638391274994
It is laid down in the physicians' professional code and determined ultimately by the patient's right to self-determination, which is regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	3.224121145512788
It is established in the ordinance governing physicians' work and has its origin in the patient's right of self-determination.	3.8292334293686308
It is also regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	2.479550393839289
An exception can be made to the duty of professional secrecy if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law.	3.200739113494103
Some such exceptions are also specified in the German Social Code, although the physician's duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated, particularly when medical data in the strictest sense of the phrase are concerned.	3.3030827128437803
Borderline cases are described to illustrate how the rules of professional medical discretion are breached in the course of day-to-day business transacted between the statutory accident insurance firms and the physicians under contract to them, and some hints are given on how this can be avoided.	3.3661929285316146
We report on a 56-year-old renal allograft recipient receiving cyclosporin A immunosuppression.	2.3897167065393026
During this therapy he subsequently developed the following cutaneous neoplasms: squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis, sebaceous hyperplasia, a dysplastic naevus and, finally a nodular malignant melanoma.	2.941510641790348
Adverse effects of the cyclosporin A therapy are discussed, with special reference to dermatologic effects and the implications for patient and doctor.	3.855593814632071
With Multislice Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT), existing indications for performing CT of the chest are strengthened and new applications are emerging.	3.2070517033834864
The high speed of MSCT improves efficiency, image quality and patient comfort of "routine"- imaging of the chest.	3.4492539906632995
The ability to cover large volumes with thin slices improves the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules and allows for high-quality secondary reconstruction.	3.491790636065871
If a comprehensive diagnosis of the mediastinal structures and the pulmonary parenchyma is desired, MSCT for the first time allows reconstruction of contiguous and high- resolution (HRCT) sections from the same set of thin-collimation raw data.	3.5746345025477773
This way, contiguous chest images of superior and HRCT sections of equal image quality compared to conventional CT scanning can be obtained.	3.1754512276356874
Vascular protocols greatly benefit from the high speed of MSCT: For imaging the thoracic aorta or pulmonary emboli (PE), the amount of contrast material can be substantially reduced.	3.992529542398872
Owing to thin collimation, the detection-rate of small peripheral emboli can be significantly increased.	3.3093725219042636
If indicated, the entire subphrenic venous system can be evaluated during the same session, without additional contrast material.	3.645064965327107
Abstract   Basis of the modern shoulder implants is the Neer II-system, a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with conforming radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation.	3.3698504620908913
The second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the Neer II prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head- and shaft-sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation-translation-mechanism.	3.380516757416072
The third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the eccentric offset of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation.	3.2385710436282356
The latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3-dimensional modularity to independently adjust the prosthestic head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry.	3.2256550258850765
This achieves a 3-dimensional adaptability of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane.	3.955331917616357
Besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established - the replacement of the humeral head articular surface.	3.737038923184701
A hemispheric surface prosthesis - cup arthroplasty - is cemented onto the residual humeral head, which eliminates the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal.	2.8070377007418155
Bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi-rotational head system.	3.2568906383400518
Their indication is limited to pre-existing lesions of the rotator cuff and/or the glenoid surface.	4.427244677264248
The inverse total shoulder prosthesis reverses the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid.	3.7916108837482554
The hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component.	2.956836386675642
This implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences.	3.8050525652602154
The role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration.	2.911078763906361
A fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus, the centre of rotation, and the anatomical retroversion.	4.2740923934025155
Positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process.	3.176923969968477
A failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result.	3.478408960955945
The shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented, cementless or hybrid techniques.	3.0030655576421146
Today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist.	2.992984102021393
Their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups - the keel - and the peg-shaped glenoid components.	3.513326770687572
The peg-shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear-forces.	2.8793160759832
Cementless glenoid components consist of a polyethylen inlay and a surface treated metal-back with an integrated fixation system.	3.067617816045871
These fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self-cutting cage-screw-systems.	3.098209512050803
The critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the PE-inlay and the metal-back because of high force development.	3.1020673593138377
The question of implanting a hemi- or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface, which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease, and the age of the patient.	4.344271231315968
Preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work-up - X-ray, CT or MRI - to accurately assess the glenoid morphology.	3.742526568651402
G. Walch categorised the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations.	3.23243915611272
To compare and evaluate the operative results one must consider the different shoulder prosthesis and the discrepancies between a hemi- and a total shoulder prosthetic replacement.	3.3031739109617786
Looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are related to the type of prosthesis and the preoperative diagnosis.	4.571103326059203
The objective for the future has to be to further advance the development of prosthetic components, especially for primary joint replacement in acute humeral head fractures.	4.156226285019357
Another point of interest is how to reduce the still existing high loosening rates of the glenoid components.	3.656736909002817
A fairly new research-field is the computer-assisted surgery, e. g. navigation systems and robotics.	3.538575449556994
The computer-assisted navigation could be of great advantage to accurately find the individual resection plane (inclination and restroversion) of the humeral head.	3.5876399152534213
Two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on.	3.397072609510126
One case is well documented.	3.7835373222776987
In both cases there was very good functional adaptation, resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement.	3.240256462954537
The rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage.	3.2190949775268445
The function of the supraspinous muscle is also discussed.	3.082533864803417
Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792-1847) is generally known as the founder of modern plastic surgery.	2.949254234642036
One focus of his work, apart from the physiology of transplantation and operative techniques, was reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery.	3.130007191217674
This special aspect of plastic surgery as well as Dieffenbach's biography is presented in this historic article.	3.493804264825357
When a lifeless person is found in a bath tub, the emergency physician is obliged to give medical assistance.	3.3782362807453197
If the patient is dead on arrival, the manner of death will in most cases unsettled.	3.3716201549098135
Any alteration of the scene of death should be avoided.	3.7257952481029486
The purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic-endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer.	2.5798660530272426
These procedures were applied to 29 patients.	3.9283906356724585
Preoperative work-up included gastric endoscopy, barium X-ray examination, endoscopic ultrasonography, and histological examination, and surgery was performed in patients diagnosed as having mucosal gastric cancer for which endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was difficult.	3.659864696013548
Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion-lifting method, by which a wedge resection is made while pulling up the full-thickness gastric wall, was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and greater curvature of the stomach.	3.7694258507994656
On pathological examination of resected specimens, the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients.	3.294116383976601
The histological depth of the lesions was m (mucosal cancer) in 15 patients and sm1 (slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer) in one.	3.2190728654222194
This one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found.	3.462999140386004
Oral nutrition was resumed for a mean ( +/-  SD) of 2.9  +/-  0.8 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.3  +/-  3.4 days.	3.6159864396282635
The 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection.	3.3489595059229536
Laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage.	4.660620718023025
The surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful.	3.2714948982407908
Lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2, both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region, total gastrectomy was avoided, and careful observation is continued.	3.6846655110395075
Oral nutrition was resumed 4.0  +/-  1.6 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.0  +/-  3.5 days.	3.153191968830822
In addition, no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure, and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow-up period of 460 months.	3.426143299845799
Selected properly, these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer.	3.1859944693864115
Between 1988 and 1997, tumor resection was carried out in 18 irradiated patients (group 1: 36-72 Gy, 83 implants) and 22 nonirradiated patients (group 2: 92 implants) in the mandible and floor of the mouth, and these patients subsequently underwent mandibular endosseous implant rehabilitation.	3.5655764446811524
A total of 23 patients were treated with exclusively implant-supported prostheses, and 16 with implant tissue-supported constructions.	3.4430144501506526
Between 1988 and 1991, group 1 and 2 patients received implant tissue-supported prostheses (using two to four implants).	3.3400478940700085
Due to prosthesis-related pressure lesions, the strategy has now been changed.	3.286372403314999
Since 1992, group 1 patients have received exclusively implant-supported prostheses (using five to six implants), while group 2 patients have received implant tissue-supported constructions (using four implants).	3.0583579868923265
Special criteria for the success of implant-supported maxillofacial prosthetics were drawn up.	4.143564877699403
With an average follow-up period of 37 months, 160 fixtures (91%) were clinically osseointegrated.	3.556775885170193
Both types of restoration provided sufficient oral rehabilitation.	2.8401884443338896
However, only completely implant-supported prostheses avoided soft tissue ulcers.	2.978689120310503
The overall success rate was about 77% after 7 years in group 1 and about 87% after 9 years in group 2.	3.4840357936678727
With regard to implants placed after strategy change, the 5-year success rate was approximately 86% (group 1) and 94% (group 2).	3.288456260802502
In irradiated patients, an exclusively implant-supported prosthesis without any mucosal contact (thus avoiding soft tissue ulcers with a potential to develop osteoradionecrosis) should therefore be fabricated.	3.23749350364785
Implant tissue-supported restoration is also possible in nonirradiated oral cancer patients.	3.7009879095538905
Extracorporal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment.	3.379878856622302
We have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method.	3.705385235994503
In a prospective nonrandomized study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of 6 months.	3.3504909129642626
Following 2 cycles of ESWT with 2000 impulses/18 kV, the reevaluation was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.	3.6398329509510168
A total of 27 pseudarthroses was reevaluated, in 11 one or more reosteosyntheses had been performed prior to ESWT.	3.2263920633387166
Following ESWT we found a success rate of 41 % (n = 11).	3.9876028942333352
The clinical evidence of subjective, clinical improvement was found in 5 of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within a period of 3 months.	3.7101027972314937
Radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within 6 months.	3.0502453898081208
ESWT appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion.	4.4219680697955175
If no improvement occurs, the maximum delay of reosteosynthesis is three months.	3.0858762963177604
Over a period of 11 years a total of 140 liver resections for non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine hepatic metastases were performed in 127 patients (73 women, 54 men; median age 53 years).	3.579066346168097
There were 120 first, 14 second and 6 third liver resections.	3.1573328160287204
Primary tumors were: breast cancer (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic cancer (n = 16), renal cell carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric cancer (n = 9), lung cancer (n = 6) and adrenal cancer (n = 6) and miscellaneous tumors (n = 14).	3.6662121557737866
Extrahepatic tumor manifestation (including synchronous primary tumors) was found in 69/140 cases (49 %); 61 of 120 patients with a first liver resection had extrahepatic tumor (51 %).	3.766144659733193
In the 120 first liver resections, 82 (68 %) R0, 13 (11 %) R1 and 25 (21 %) R2 excisions were possible.	3.1090545509564715
Median survival after first liver resection was 20 months; after R0 resection a median survival of 28 months and after R1/2 resection of 8 months was achieved.	3.2063170122688383
The 5-year survival rate was 16 % for the total group, 24 % in patients with R0 resection and 0 % for R1/2 resections.	3.501451662207373
After a second liver resection (n = 14) there was a median survival of 28 months (5-year-survival-rate of 21 %) for all patients and of 41 months (5-year survival rate 38 %) after R0 resection.	3.7194603502177777
Morbidity and mortality after the first liver resection were 32.5 % and 5.8 %, respectively.	3.158485887971374
In patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the first liver resection a median survival of 32 months (5-year survival rate 25 %) and 7 months was achieved after R0 resection and R1/2 resection, respectively.	3.410218480538946
In case of extrahepatic tumor the median survival was 24 months (5-year survival rate 23 %) for R0 resection compared to 8 months after R1/2 resection.	3.0050585587343557
These data suggest that not the presence of extrahepatic tumor but rather the possibility of a R0 resection is most decisive for the prognosis after liver resection.	3.8448300460506855
We conclude that patients with liver metastases of non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine tumors may benefit from liver resection.	3.6137291614535427
Similar to colorectal metastases, a second or third liver resection can be worthwhile in selected cases.	3.011685660551037
Even in more unfavorable tumor entities, several cases of long-term survival were observed after surgical therapy.	3.8276992639097256
Therefore, the indication for liver resection should be considered carefully in every single case.	3.3413416897265003
Generalizations about the outcomes of psychotherapy are essentially based on research on brief therapies with quite short follow-up.	2.946118978310911
The present paper is a survey of some of the findings in an effectiveness study of psychoanalysis and long-term psychotherapy, typically psychoanalytically oriented, in private practice.	3.8523196789517717
The design was a three-wave panel comprising more than 700 patients.	3.2675467211067546
At the end of the third wave, 418 patients in different phases of treatment remained in the sample.	3.002130686123326
Across a reconstructed time scale covering roughly seven years, before, during, and after treatment, the 74 psychoanalysis cases described a very positive development, whereas the development among the 331 psychotherapy cases was moderately positive.	3.5029264156013267
The findings emphasize the importance of extended follow-up.	3.4622218023827736
When therapist variables are considered, therapeutic experience had complex or mixed associations with patients outcome.	3.095580420279409
Especially positive were high age and many years, in private practice, after licensing.	3.473400792301632
Therapeutic ideals and attitudes divided the therapist group in three subgroups, one of which was characterized by purely classical psychoanalytic views on the values of support, friendliness etc.	3.099404717497907
Therapists in the classically psychoanalytic cluster were found to do poorly with patients in psychotherapy, in contrast to patients in psychoanalysis.	3.756992830990447
Experimental studies and open clinical trials have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as a potentially effective treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).	3.4541280897333833
The Austrian Immunoglobulin in Multiple Sclerosis (AIMS) study tested this assumption by examining 148 patients with relapsing-remitting MS in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled fashion (75 IVIg, 73 placebo).	2.7847736446021467
Monthly administration of IVIg in a dosage of 0.15-0.20 g/kg over a period of 2 years slowed the progression of or even reversed disability as evident in a total of 24% of patients and almost halved the number of relapses in comparison to placebo treatment.	4.0147526634131685
Therapeutic efficacy was noted within the first 6 months of treatment and was not correlated to the severity of disability (mild neurological sins without disability to ambulatory with assistance) at study entry.	3.775945983548827
Overall the magnitude of treatment effects of IVIg was comparable to that reported for beta-interferon and copolymer 1.	3.467089289690445
Further ongoing studies will have to clarify the future role of IVIg in the treatment of MS, in particular in the progressive forms of the disease.	3.9682199244962155
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of ischemic heart disease.	3.732049298309824
Incidence, etiology and optimal treatment are ill-defined.	3.4621130833954026
Between July 1995 and December 1997, we prospectively identified 42 patients (36 men, six women, mean age 59 +/- 12 years) with spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 3803 consecutive angiographic examinations in which the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was established for the first time (incidence 1.1%).	3.6974454511060832
In comparison to the remaining study population with stable angina pectoris (8 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 2852 patients; incidence: 0.3%), the incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was significantly higher in the patient subgroups with acute myocardial infarction (13/450; 2.9%) and with unstable angina pectoris or postinfarction angina (21/501; 4.2%).	3.4849705573485488
Dissection was most frequently located in the left anterior descending coronary artery (19 cases), followed by the right coronary artery (15 cases) and the left circumflex coronary artery (8 cases).	4.787274382463872
The presumed etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was atherosclerotic plaque rupture in 35 cases, heavy physical exercise in four cases and hormonal influences related to pregnancy and contraception in one case.	3.0303707426228557
In two cases, no obvious risk factor could be identified.	3.1258008154762167
Therapy consisted of intracoronary stenting in 24 patients (including ten patients with acute myocardial infarction), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 8 patients and balloon angioplasty (PTCA) in seven patients.	3.7703995985947634
Three patients were treated conservatively.	4.204827741738592
Introduction: Since the introduction of laparoscopic hernioplasty the TAPP procedure (transabdominal preperitoneal approach) has become the most widely used technique.	3.582852574695306
Many surgeons have changed to the total extraperitoneal approach (TEP), because they fear the consequences of a peritoneal lesion.	3.4597085377441545
Method: We evaluated our results with TAPP in a retrospective study, with special attention to complications caused by the approach.	4.203441393719175
We operated on 460 hernias in 390 patients in a period of 5 years.	3.3480546226661345
Results: Complication rates and recurrence rates were similar to those after TEP.	3.780987280344419
There was a marked learning curve with decrease of both rates during the evaluated years.	2.8761009400735307
There were no complications related to the transabdominal approach other than trocar hernias, the rate of which could be reduced by eliminating the learning curve and by using smaller trocar diameter.	3.5324886288142627
Conclusion: We see no reason to change from TAPP to the TEP technique.	3.0221407578207975
This article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines, automatic teller machines (ATMs) and telephone cards by the elderly in four European regions.	2.9309532961018703
The analyses are based on data from an international project entitled "Keeping the Elderly Mobile", collected in Mannheim (former West Germany; N=404 home-dwelling respondents), Chemnitz (former East Germany; N=400), Ancona (Italy; N=600), and Jyväskylä (Finland; N=618).	2.887669390745109
The random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country.	3.147906651036313
Two generations of men and women (aged 55-74 and 75+ years, respectively) participated in the study.	3.4282731278209395
Results show that respondents generally made little use of the three technologies under investigation: in fact, the majority of respondents does not use them at all.	3.8897352145208863
The most frequently used devices were ATMs in Chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in Mannheim.	2.57937471937719
On the basis of logistic regression analysis, age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions, i.e., the users were mostly the "young-old."	3.489973432827164
Education was a more important variable than gender.	3.8747224170408128
In all four regions, the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier; nevertheless, ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in Mannheim.	2.909372376932747
Interesting differences and similarities among the towns were also found.	3.097232356316085
The present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth.	2.7606006238423872
In order to examine the efficacy of whole body acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in depression, a single-blind placebo-controlled study with 70 inpatients administered to three different treatment groups has been carried out.	3.4055634880803236
All patients were pharmacologically treated with the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin.	3.046614770103511
The verum group (n=22) received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression.	4.385234536096346
The placebo group (n=24) was treated with acupuncture at non-specific locations and the control group (n=24) received only pharmacological treatment.	4.027160787398156
Acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks.	3.9572630502637196
Psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum/placebo conditions twice a week over eight weeks with the CGI, GAS, BRMS and BfS rating scales.	2.7947404628904464
Additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself.	3.456997720880704
However, we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture.	3.132067119838085
Acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure, acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.	3.2874703023529555
While decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated.	3.3125243722062514
Cardiogenic shock, however is still a therapeutic challenge.	3.693494882248376
For therapy of cardiogenic shock positive inotropes, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use.	3.0651762206221846
Two years after the diagnosis of Sézary syndrome, a 50-year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet, leading to acral necrosis.	3.9301372064083493
Another 59-year old patient presented with severe pain in his feet, secondary to ischemia.	4.161834445862757
This was the first symptom of a T-cell-chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	3.512588441302459
Similar cases have only occasionally been described.	3.5782342042985844
The relationship between acral ischemia and T-cell-lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article.	3.456592989190259
The clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in combina-tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast- enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma.	2.9502164602422702
We report our findings in a 57-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma.	3.26931219131287
A large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits.	3.232640384691668
Both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate manifestationes of a lymphoma.	3.089609694906485
The development of a progressive facial palsy within 8 weeks of presentation and an atypi-cal occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma.	3.0114407850716516
Such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car-dinal symptoms require further diagnostic measures.	3.3900055923047003
Manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare.	3.891511296644639
To our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome has never been reported before.	3.7318545635535703
Cutaneous blisters on a corpse are not only of forensic interest regarding their etiology and genesis but also the time of origin, particularly the problem of vital, agonal, supravital or postmortem occurrence of cutaneous blisters could be of forensic value.	3.643130852464511
The aim of this work was to summarize the causative spectrum of cutaneous blisters, including poisonous plants and animals, drugs and toxic substances.	2.958398063970427
The time of origin of cutaneous blisters were evaluated in selected forensically relevant cases.	3.5848746593510623
The purpose of the present study was to compare two sedation regimens with either propofol (P) or methohexital (M) for elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with respect to safety, side effects, recovery, and discharge time.	3.4821016594148193
Pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion.	3.7110051983174617
Nevertheless, thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications.	3.6139325318648026
The most frequent complication is hemorrhage.	2.763964811823648
Of these, the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare, but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications, and they have an extremely poor prognosis.	3.3661931972490806
Within 58 months 361 patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas.	3.927593680931666
Two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery.	4.617217684774003
One patient died: the other survived but was severely disabled.	2.9767527393158817
The latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned.	3.362762523446596
Local selective (or superselective) thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure, provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications.	3.435692335169735
We report on a 61-year-old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease.	2.7261293696944597
The congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of (post-endocarditic) insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life.	3.6788907007629845
It was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization.	3.6638721433481414
The physiopathology of quadricuspid aortic valve will be discussed.	3.008780774455721
Due to its high prevalence, atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice.	4.154799406907688
The chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system.	3.3462219155313626
We describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our Department of Dermatology.	3.3130809749746684
The aims of this clinic are an optimized outpatient management of atopic dermatitis, the gathering of epidemiologic data, the performance of controlled studies, and potentially the reduction of costs.	3.489699047403081
We present the first case of a traumatic aneurysm of the A1/A2 junction.	3.516370017400247
Purpose: Although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago, the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear.	3.285269023229056
Recent OCT studies have shown schisislike spaces in connection with the disc.	3.998378566105036
None of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven.	3.176703773913084
Besides the hypothesis of exudation, the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion.	3.277976314123084
The purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits.	3.3945771842451427
Sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion, which was not recognized until a few years ago.	4.119482642193126
As in sclerosing adenosis of the breast, a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate.	3.331613062361013
An incidence of 2.8 % was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands.	3.1093188455561322
As demonstrated in this case report, the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	3.925555845244061
Histological diagnosis of sclerosing adenosis based on routine HE sections is supplemented by immunohistochemical methods.	2.8965574625992208
Important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation, which is demonstrated by cytokeratin 903, and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation, with expression of S-100 and/or smooth muscle actin.	4.339389735307371
These antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	3.646497283861294
Nevertheless, in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible, even after the application of immunohistochemical methods.	3.8557720086518064
Further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	2.8470656729356008
So far, there appears to be no evidence of a direct relationship between sclerosing adenosis of the prostate and an elevated risk of carcinoma.	3.933095354668307
Benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to "malignant" complications, so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance.	3.3141398857339284
Our investigation summarizes a 10-year experience after surgical treatment of 29 patients suffering from benign intracavitary cardiac tumors.	3.7967403587554713
The postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in 27 cases; in 2 cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed.	3.262023326608033
The main symptom in 19 patients was dyspnea.	3.5596838408293894
All patients underwent extirpation of the tumor.	3.099355406070877
Early mortality was 10 %, while late mortality was 4 %.	3.216761559898312
In such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance.	2.84552647887757
We present a case of a 48 year old man who complained of progressive dyspnoe.	3.5972142175120445
Radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung.	5.4334131703111295
Biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium polymorph tumor cells admixed with some histiocytes.	3.238455123168562
These tumor cells were strongly pigmented and expressed HMB-45 and protein S-100 immunohistochemically.	3.5082950449447643
Malignant melanoma of the bronchus was included in the differential diagnosis.	3.215646944201358
A thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed.	3.4226991455669125
The lung is an uncommon localisation of angiomyolipoma with so far three reported cases.	3.266904747162335
Lipoma, leiomyoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis have to be included in the differential diagnosis.	3.498055200206523
This has not been reported yet.	3.789820592787923
Background: The maximum number of cell divisions of a certain cell population is genetically fixed so that aging cells become non-dividing (senescent) at least.	2.9483300002488093
This replicative life span, also known as "hayflick limit", is probably defined by a "critical" length of the telomeres.	3.4489112382351537
Telomeres are special DNA-sequences located at the four ends of the chromosomes which are shortened with each cell cycle.	3.2354539286770025
Cells of most, but not all malignant tumours have been shown to reactivate the enzyme telomerase so that telomeres can be reconstructed, "Hayflick limit" can be overcome, and unlimited cell division can be established.	3.1504867257509694
This study was undertaken to elucidate whether telomerase reactivation is used by uveal melanoma cells.	2.665136448930795
A total of 113 patients with acute and chronic instability of the ulnar collateral ligament metacarpal phalangeal (MP) joint of the thumb were treated surgically between 1980 and 1985; 82 patients were followed up after a mean period of 10 years.	3.547984388108586
Of 59 patients with acute injuries, 52 were painfree with full stability of the MP joint; 23 patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability.	3.739650321302938
Nevertheless, the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired.	3.3473010541875974
The results of follow-up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective.	3.714294521725277
The purpose of this study was to assess the role of spiral computed tomography (SCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative work-up of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, regarding local resectability and vascular involvement.	3.5591407229295147
Methods and materials: A total of 28 patients (19 men and 9 women; mean age 58 years) with known or highly suspected carcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study.	4.056628429470246
All patients prospectively underwent MRI ( +/-  gadolinium-DTPA) and SCT (3-phase examination) as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies, and laparotomy was carried out within 7 days, irrespective of the MRI or SCT findings.	3.674073908722091
SCT and MR studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, without knowing the results of the surgical exploration.	3.9520147865733635
Standardized image analysis was correlated with findings at laparatomy.	3.441175344390579
Results: Laparotomy identified 10 patients to be suitable for surgical resection and 18 pancreatic carcinomas to be unresectable.	3.6030991630450706
In 17 of 18 non-resectable carcinomas MRI and SCT were able to obtain correct information about unresectability (sensitivity 94 %), in 7 (MRI), resp.	3.2471798926565314
8 (SCT) carcinomas were correctly considered to be resectable (sensitivity 70 % for MRI and 80 % for SCT).	3.5144872372884564
The presence of vascular involvement was depicted by SCT with a sensitivity of 82-100 % and 62-100 % by MRI.	3.12741715558937
The specificity varied between 85-100 % for SCT and 77-100 % for MRI.	3.3970034467122
Conclusion: Both MRI and SCT are good techniques for the preoperative work-up of pancreatic carcinomas in order to obtain a correct assessment of local resectability.	4.058919616885914
Pancreatic pseudocysts occur as a complication in the natural course of acute or chronic pancreatitis, with a spontaneous resolution rate of 40 % to 60 %.	4.137223269567047
The incidence of pseudocysts in the course of chronic pancreatitis amounts to 60 %.	3.6987794569242958
Pseudocysts have to be differentiated from neoplastic or congenital pancreatic cystic lesions.	3.7879157748620575
Careful diagnostic work-up including ERCP and CT scanning is mandatory in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts.	3.418617858016921
The indication for treatment depends on the development of symptoms or complications.	4.483660390145201
Pain is present in up to 90 % of all patients, and the rate of complications varies between 2 % and 55 %.	5.179761174182186
Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually an epiphenomenon of chronic pancreatitis.	3.5135097520766854
Pancreatic resection therefore represents a causative treatment.	3.0033260600457417
New percutaneous and endoscopic techniques for draining pseudocysts are challenging the previous hegemony of the surgeon.	3.054492004464083
However, so far no prospectively collected data are available comparing the results of interventional and surgical drainage procedures.	3.4424293322334445
Therefore, in most symptomatic cases surgery is considered the treatment of choice.	3.700920660163184
A 28-year-old drug addict who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis (simultaneously: hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection by delta hepatitis).	2.889845496173414
Liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive microvesicular steatosis, compatible with a delta virus infection.	2.804326188925984
Moderate pulmonary fat embolism (grade I-II according to Falzi) was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages.	3.3307590627286463
It is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing hepatocytes may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism; the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.	2.8433056404760078
Suicide on railways (either by being run over by or jumping in front of a train) is one of the 'hardest' suicide methods.	3.0963359247409343
In Austria, 617 suicides or attempted suicides on railways were registered between 1990 and 1994.	2.615321655497914
This amounts to 5.73 % of all suicides committed in this period with women showing a higher percentage than men.	2.9753358745589233
In both men and women there was a predominance of younger age groups; the mean age was higher in women than in men (48.0 vs 40.4 years).	3.5895710405142935
There was a significant increase in suicides or attempted suicides on railways after a television report on the stress suffered by train drivers concerning possible suicides.	2.623055769026366
Persuading the mass media to treat the subject of 'suicide' with reserve and with greater caution, even when not presenting a distinct suicide model, may be of importance in general suicide prevention.	3.54037162148281
Since the beginning of 1995 we practice a gamma-probe guided sentinel lymphonodectomy (SLNE) on patients with melanoma from a Breslow tumor thickness of 1 mm upward, after injecting a colloidal 99m-Tc labelled tin (II) - sulfid solution around the tumor or the scar, if the tumor has been excided before.	2.938372809386132
By this method, that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage I or II (UICC) but even histopathologically to a stage III and who are profiting of a removal of the regional lymph nodes, the sentinel node can be exactly localised, tissue-sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity.	3.4750671591526414
When finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows.	3.931265488257836
In most cases, a deterioration of subjective well-being due to the consequences of the hip fracture could be prevented; the well-being improved in most cases.	4.0517348233178065
When discharged, the subjective well-being of our patients was comparable to the well-being of similar-aged people living at home.	4.206474344961024
Antidepressants are used in demented patients for treating depressive symptoms as well as other non-cognitive symptoms including agitation, aggression and irritability.	3.5458403908534093
As patients are usually elderly, a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants.	3.349502552102674
New antidepressants such as the SSRIs and the reversible MAO inhibitors should be the first-line agents in these patients, because their efficacy is not different from that of classic TCA, but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects, ease of use and safety.	3.6234940759383623
Improvement in cognitive performance, however, may not be expected from the new antidepressants.	4.186556166068746
For the treatment of agitation, aggression and irritabiltiy, antipychotics and benzodiazepines are in frequent use, although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patiens.	2.9122420198822363
All medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples, so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously.	3.28561048926238
The application of laser energy to joint capsular tissues resulted in the reduction of the joint capsule.	3.7963247142562357
Primary clinical results of combined laser-assisted capsular shrinkage (LACS) and multiple suture repair (Caspari) for arthroscopic stabilization procedure of anterior shoulder instability are presented.	3.292379256419482
From July 1997 to October 1998, 18 patients (2 female, 16 male; mean age 27.9 years; range 16-42 years) with anterior instability and recurrent dislocations of the shoulder received a combined arthroscopic stabilization procedure.	3.496221783753271
The operative technique involved the use of transglenoid sutures to repair the labrum and shift the capsule (Caspari) and LACS.	2.977075918979674
Laser energy was applied using a Ho: YAG laser (10 W, 1 J, 10 pulses/s, total energy: 1500-2000 J).	2.925273482864576
The patients were followed for an average of 9 months (range 4-20 months).	4.17320644415394
From June 1992 to Februrary 1996, arthroscopic suture stabilization without laser shrinkage was performed on 17 patients (2 female, 15 male; age 25.9 years/range 18-37 years).	3.0180867210588826
The average follow-up in this group was 4.5 years (range 2-5.5 years), and we found 41.2% (7/17) recurrent dislocations.	4.119626705308516
Only in one patient (5.6%, 1/18) did we find this failure.	3.3444142559211114
No complications occurred in either group.	2.4884711258696246
Although, no long-term results are available, the method seems to be suitable for associating low recurrence rates with the advantages of arthroscopic surgery.	4.167354324965469
Simple bone cysts are asymptomatic, benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph.	3.3965197758227004
Etiology and treatment are controversially discussed.	3.768438359139793
The weightbearing status of the calcaneus and possible pathologic fracturing lead many authors to recommend therapeutic measures after diagnosis has been made.	3.4271126239039305
We present a case report of an intact unicameral bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma.	3.196867593551433
Several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested.	3.468706606068657
The question whether treatment is unconditionally necessary is controversially discussed.	2.813984740567953
It is the author's opinion, that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment.	2.930177200829794
Facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis.	3.3147623384480456
In the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated.	3.607528244872303
Twenty healthy subjects underwent four neuromyographic tests at intervals of one week.	3.249049962037257
The study group consisted of 12 males and 8 females.	3.2684350518160206
Ages ranged from 23 to 36 years.	3.087699301971375
The stimulation intensity required for supramaximal stimulation was 14.6 mA on average.	2.852116665938606
The mean of the intra-individual side-to-side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32.5%.	3.264922016287789
Results of the four repeated tests ranged from no to 80% side-to-side differences in the same individual.	3.6152810592386513
The hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data.	2.952205085720117
As with previous investigators we found significant side-to-side differences in healthy subjects.	3.3916028001077563
Furthermore, we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements.	3.2212266053769127
We conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography.	3.3848738973960812
To compare patient dose and image quality of electron-beam-CT vs. spiral-CT by means of phantom measurements.	3.6137427438417578
An EBCT scanner (C-150 XP) and a spiral-CT scanner (GE  HiSpeed Advantage) were used to scan three different phantoms.	3.544734491980199
EBCT showed 25-35% lower HC resolution in comparison to spiral-CT. LC lesion detectability showed equivalent results for S/N vs. patient dose using 3 mm collimation with EBCT and spiral-CT, whereas spiral-CT was superior for 1,5 and 6 mm collimation.	3.3776954865478315
Dose measurements revealed a 2 fold higher patient dose using EBCT with 1,5 mm or 6 mm collimation compared to spiral-CT using equivalent scan parameters.	3.330833979274122
Differences were due to insufficient beamside collimation of the EBCT.	3.065486596227555
Using 3 mm collimation, EBCT showed comparable performance like state of the art spiral-CT despite lower HC resolution.	3.3269242261409606
In an experimental study, the biomechanical qualities of the combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO) in the unstable Colles' fracture were analyzed.	3.0880687155283404
This type of pin fixation is our preferred osteosynthesis in the treatment of unstable Colles' fracture because it allows immediate functional therapy.	3.3288661449204175
It represents a modification of Kapandji's dynamic KWO, compensating for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static KWO.	3.200061719517286
Clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results, was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined KWO and its single components should be constituted.	4.0521050595649095
Simulation of the unstable Colles' fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material.	3.42916677996649
The combined KWO unifies the advantage of volar stability of the conventional KWO with the high dorsal stability of dynamic KWO.	3.6925464977107425
The main functional principle of dynamic KWO with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission.	3.3154430959019145
Besides its good stabilization, dynamic KWO also leads to optimal alignment of the distal metaphyseal fragment.	3.3938755670797476
Furthermore, the experiments yielded important information about technical aspects of the surgical procedure, which helps us to avoid anatomical and functional deficiencies.	3.372983337242755
Based on these experimental findings, the surgical technique of combined KWO was standardized.	3.689761755269821
Purpose: It is difficult to measure the topography of the cornea with high resolution and visualize it on a map displaying refraction.	3.4458024890420367
This is demonstrated by the ongoing improvement and further development of different methods and by the fact that users of these techniques are not always satisfied.	4.265336921930285
We present the case of a 2-year-old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive scalding of the face.	3.169609823298672
Because of the morphological findings the medico-legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven.	2.955204511589071
During the criminal proceedings at the appeal court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico-legal expert became obvious.	3.2490404205616277
Findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and pouring of water and the influence of clothing in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment.	3.843706491043101
The opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be refuted.	4.130946674362859
During the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an acquittal "in dubio pro reo".	3.0755805126858697
Anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in 163 patients.	4.141731066086463
Lesions treated were located between T4 and L3, most frequently occuring at T12/L2.	3.085451656601684
Operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure.	3.196086335098776
2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure.	3.0747168671935765
One positioning related pressure harm on the thoracodorsal nerve and one irritation of the L1 root at the entrance site were both transitory.	2.8331474561951544
Postoperative control by X-ray and CTscan showed correct positioning of the bone graft, as well as the fixation device in all patients.	4.260550813950101
Our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method.	3.6528010144225513
Major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach, postoperative pain reduction, early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay.	3.74899219855383
In order to restore function and esthetics in mandibular hypoplasia, transplantation of osteochondral grafts and the distraction osteogenesis technique are used alternatively.	3.0647552358816474
In a retrospective study the indication, growth and complication rate of osteochondral graft and distraction osteogenesis cases in mandibular hypoplasia were compared.	3.2501516630488667
In total, 12 patients (4-14 years old; 7 female, 5 male) with different grades of mandibular hypoplasia received osteochondral grafts (7 costochondral, 5 iliac crest; observation period 4-9 years).	3.300860219911855
In 5 patients (10-12 years old; 1 female, 4 male), distraction osteogenesis was performed (observation period 10 months to 3 1/2 years).	3.502830547370969
In the results, according to the literature, the range of growth after osteochondral grafting varied considerably, approximate normal growth was noticed in only two cases.	3.7022194923036476
On the other hand, all patients treated by distraction osteogenesis showed a stable increase of bone length as expected.	3.397969342674778
After osteochondral grafts, adequate growth is to be expected in the minority of cases and it does not seem predictable in individual cases.	3.507583486050702
Therefore, the indication for osteochondral grafts should be restricted to severe hypoplasia, where the local amount of bone does not allow the use of a distraction device, and to cases where support of the mandibula at the skull base is necessary.	3.5286710266524275
In all other cases of mandibular hypoplasia in children, distraction osteogenesis should be discussed as the primary option, even if in the long term a second surgical procedure should be necesssary.	3.8828617523473103
To evaluate the predictive value of MRI in the early postoperative course after cruciate ligament replacement, a prospective study was performed.	4.205836329098729
Twenty patients with reconstructed anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament were examined clinically and with contrast-enhanced MRI 2, 12, 24 weeks, 1 and 2 years postoperatively.	3.99994833865158
The clinical examinations were evaluated according to the scores by Lysholm, OAK and IKDC.	3.3283008814391635
The MRI scans (SP 63, 1.5 Tesla) were evaluated regarding the quality and signal intensity of the reconstructed ligament.	3.570110746351369
During the first postoperative year a significant increase in signal intensity and inhomogeneity of the neoligament in MRI was observed in 16 patients with an average value for signal/noise of 1.1 2 weeks postoperatively up to 6.9 1 year postoperatively.	3.711397505160327
In 12 patients the reconstructed ligament could not be evaluated in the 1-year postoperative MRI, whereas none of these patients was suspected clinically of having instability.	3.719696386762825
In the 2-year postoperative MRI, the signal intensity of the neoligament was found to be decreasing again with improvement in judgement.	3.7138951561242237
Miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today.	4.737188334017303
Apart from easy handling, in the majority of cases it also ensures adequate fracture stability.	3.493848244435471
The treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent.	3.419953435354691
Titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures.	4.497003575756324
Compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry.	3.0580846049104755
The titanium mesh can be adapted and screwed individually in any situation, in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates.	3.1528787973597217
As a result, complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent.	3.1732634283766394
Non-invasive methods to identify absent or persistent myocardial viability have gained increasing importance in the therapeutic management and risk stratification of patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	3.715401657676216
Myocardial scintigraphy using thallium-201 and positron emission tomography with metabolic imaging of myocardial glucose metabolism, using fluorine-18 fluoro-deoxyglucose, are today the most widely used nuclear methods for the assessment of myocardial viability.	3.005705458448681
Besides the prediction of reversible regional and global myocardial dysfunction following coronary revascularization, both methods have demonstrated the ability to identify patient subgroups who will benefit most with regard to cardiac prognosis and survival and those patients in whom coronary revascularization has a limited effect with regard to survival and cardiac events.	3.7019630007212
This short review summarizes the clinical impact of both imaging modalities on todays diagnostic approach in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	3.3288065565770486
An elderly woman was found dead in her farm house lying in a pool of blood and was partially unclothed.	3.2546339322077387
Blood was also discovered in several rooms on the first floor.	3.5713132860663577
The investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual murder.	3.8264700233485853
The autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis.	3.787971928587209
The woman has obviously been surprised by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage.	2.879397498720756
A similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described.	3.8629322818608482
In the ankle (talocrural) joint, the lower end of the tibia and fibula embrace the trochlea tali.	3.6273377528089776
Thus, an approximately uniaxial joint is formed which permits dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot against the leg.	3.0283843277519122
Due to the geometry of the trochlea tali, conjunct lateral rotation of the fibula against the tibia occurs at the tibiofibular articulations synchronously with active dorsiflexion at the ankle joint.	2.8043074292678156
Movements at the talocrural joints are mainly limited by the opposing muscles as well as by strong collateral ligaments.	3.5802908969082727
Talus and calcaneus form a functional unit connected by posterior and anterior articulations.	3.363806567666544
The posterior articulation is the subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint; in the anterior articulation, talar facets of the calcaneus together with the posterior surface of the navicular and the superior fibrocartilaginous surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament form a concavity for the talar head.	3.1605214326442588
Thus, the talocalcaneonavicular joint is a compound and - like the subtalar joint - a multiaxial articulation.	3.079241552043417
On the weight-bearing foot, the distal tarsus and metatarsus are pronated and supinated against the talus in order to maintain plantigrade contact.	3.310291057273806
When the foot is off the ground, these movements are modified to eversion and inversion, also involving the calcaneocuboid joint.	2.8530377712191064
In addition, movements between the calcaneus and cuboid also occur during pronative or supinative changes between the fore- and hindfoot.	2.88510304660698
Limitation of movements is due to leg muscles as well as strong ligaments.	4.322508723227067
A case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented.	2.8659479393831315
The tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII associated antigen) and express also histiocytic antigens (CD 68, lysozyme, Cathepsin D, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin) as well as CD 8.	3.0254585927889135
This marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with  histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of littoral cells angioma.	3.474788649102344
Despite major advances in knowledge and development of efficient techniques for pain control, many patients on surgical wards suffer from modest to severe pain following surgery or trauma.	3.2567695518444975
Therefore, in the University Hospital of Kiel, Germany, an anaesthesiology-based acute pain service (APS) was started in 1985 to improve this situation.	3.134477957583318
The anaesthesiologist in training who manages the recovery unit serves as an APS for surgical wards and is supervised by a consultant.	3.061552288768164
The anaesthesists on call are responsible after regular working hours.	3.037415680102761
The activities of the APS are as follows: 1.	3.482439955536209
Induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients.	3.606770540473892
Clinical rounds on all patients receiving epidural analgesia (EA), other forms of regional analgesia, or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) every morning and throughout the day if necessary.	2.9895640737234457
Additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request.	3.6824862237089997
Assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient, quality of analgesia, and side effects.	5.001760945893354
Writing orders for further treatment.	3.800680162136152
Continuing consultations and informal education for ward nurses, physiotherapists, and surgical staff; formal medical training for ward nurses in postoperative pain management.	3.226405185210933
From 1985 to 1992, 1947 patients on normal wards were treated (EA: 1736, PCA: 183).	2.749886502986298
Epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0.175% - 0.25% infused continuously with top-ups if needed (mean 240 mg/day, range 75 - 600 mg; median duration 7 days, range 1 - 53, Table 1).	2.8525223521913508
Demand for further treatment was proved by day-to-day withdrawal.	3.9316525832576605
Since the introduction of an APS, complications of EA such as hypotension (1985/1986: 5.1%; 1987/1992: 0.5%, Table 3) and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly (Table 3).	2.9784361939321107
Dermal infections were seen in 2.6% of patients, with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases (4.1%).	5.383975263020128
Epidural opioids were used in only 46 selected cases on surgical wards.	3.4127206002318387
Nevertheless, 2 cases of marked respiratory depression occurred.	3.354606777776323
The overall risk of complications during postoperative EA could be reduced from 1 : 11 cases in the first 2 years to 1 : 20 in the last 6 years since introducing the APS.	3.6103237624704634
For other regional procedures (e.g., interpleural analgesia) no complications were recorded.	3.047582455431056
PCA was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion (Table 6).	3.066571401496544
The loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit.	3.4641183282989236
The median duration of PCA was 4 days (range 1 - 23); the median dose of piritramide was 45 mg/day (range 3 - 226 mg).	3.231663530505438
Two cases of somnolence and respiratory depression occurred.	2.8112725202782376
In this period there were 8 potential life-threatening complications due to postoperative pain therapy; 4 occurred during standard surgical pain management (3 cases of severe respiratory depression after i.m.	3.3433571032527496
piritramide (unsuccessfull resuscitation), tramadol, and buprenorphine; 1 small child with multiorgan failure after paracetamol intoxication).	2.9188748673984755
In those cases the APS was not involved.	3.2087920405534818
There are insufficient data for comparison of the incidence of complications following standard management of postoperative pain relief without an APS, i.e., i.m.	4.159816889662133
injections of opioids on request, but severe and sometimes lethal complications have been reported.	3.332523979134548
Since the majority of patients used EA or PCA for several days, it is again emphasised that these techniques should not be restricted to high-dependency areas such as intensive care or recovery units.	3.673127824025279
The introduction of an APS is an adequate approach to more efficient and safer pain management on surgical wards.	2.878439881868314
Lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally, bilaterally or in combination with other craniosynostoses.	3.434773597915517
Using the concept of fronto-orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis.	3.576563080567487
It allows precise, reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments.	3.3288242488689477
Artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy.	3.779735311305399
The remodelling leads to a well-proportioned skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume.	3.9729483944335473
This article presents the operative method and the results of 14 patients.	3.718447989094266
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neoplasm of neural crest origin.	3.5758961044837156
It almost always occurs in children younger than one year of age with a predilection for the anterior maxillary ridge.	3.2813890086215145
Although it usually follows a benign course, local destruction as well as metastasis and death may result from the tumor.	4.101024720632014
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor is most commonly treated by surgery.	3.1166174133772726
10-15% of the lesions recur.	4.82891406499687
We report the case of a 2-month-old infant suffering from melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy of the premaxilla who was successfully treated with a combination of various chemotherapeutic agents in order to spare the child a mutilating operation or the late effects of radiation.	3.3270709535444682
Computer-assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures.	3.5248599917854264
Several reports on clinical results of computer-aided screw insertion in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as well as the sacro-iliac joints are available.	3.618330621655154
They show a significant decrease of screw malplacement rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques.	3.8413268873940933
Over the past years, antioxidants, and particularly vitamin E, have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases.	3.6060688050050005
In rheumatology, interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.	4.320127548519358
However, the concept of using antioxidant nutrients as potential remedies is not new.	3.2478489276345064
As early as the sixties, first case reports have described beneficial effects of vitamin E in the therapy of osteoarthritis.	3.3066546430328283
Nonetheless, most of the following studies were not conducted properly, thus, not allowing valid inferences about the efficacy of vitamin E. Newer studies with sound methodology have shown a beneficial effect in rheumatic diseases, mainly in the reduction of pain.	4.14042115531147
This paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin E in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.	3.1914331635350557
Patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (i.v.-PCA) represents the gold standard in the management of acute postoperative pain.	3.1228877650563174
However, in many countries i.v.-PCA is rarely used.	2.9184218380456786
Recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management.	3.3461619137130287
In the present study we investigated patients' acceptance and assessment of patient-controlled intranasal analgesia (PCINA) and compared it to intravenous PCA and the customarily prescribed pain therapy.	3.030517068552516
Unreamed nailing with solid tibial nails is an accepted method of treatment for open tibial shaft fractures up to grade III and of closed tibial fractures with severe soft tissue damage.	3.3775471495504266
However, fatigue failure of the distal locking bolts is a frequent complication.	4.479993505098057
We report a mechanical study investigating the fatigue limit of six different types of locking bolts used in solid tibial nails (Biorigid Tibial nail/aap, UTN/ace, STN/Howmedica, TLN/Howmedica, R & T Tibial nail/Smith & Nephew, AO/ASIF UTN/Synthes).	2.5676466796603514
Our results prove a direct correlation between the bolt's diameter and mechanical properties.	3.339182426036377
Further more we found that bolts with a continuing thread were weaker than bolts of the same diameter with only a short thread and an increased diameter at the nail's aperture.	3.2296010007545917
Our results suggest that mobilization with half of the average body weight (350N) allows osseous consolidation without fatigue failure of any of the tested locking bolts.	3.267160326670812
Some of the tested locking bolts may even withstand full weight-bearing in a physiological walking cycle, but will not withstand the stress of a running cycle.	2.8823726640520895
Voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and/or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections.	3.565790124928826
The urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders, but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction.	3.37078521983323
In the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed.	3.2487432869593262
Behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role.	3.246469699857913
Therapy is based on behavioural modification.	4.204413350280278
Dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug.	3.243192955407873
Before the introduction of isotretinoin, dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne.	3.5804512976324783
To date, its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described.	3.3021000217263574
When hematologic parameters are monitored, dapsone is considered a safe and cost-effective drug, especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available.	3.9725558290234537
However, the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study.	2.829922377790273
Anaesthesia both for adenotomy (AT) and for tonsillectomy (TE) frequently presents a challenge.	3.136554379898431
On one hand, children scheduled for adenotomy often have upper airway infections and are thus at risk of laryngo- and bronchospasm; on the other hand the ENT surgeon and the anaesthetist have to share the "workspace" in the patient's mouth.	3.5378825267765426
Since the succinyl choline debate in the early 1990s, the question of the best muscle relaxant has gone hand in hand with that of the most appropriate means of securing the airway.	3.7590731309869225
The concept of the laryngeal mask as airway was initially greeted with scepticism.	3.0806754732801633
Following several years' use of the mask for this purpose in AT and TE in young children, we report our experience and summarise the literature on this topic.	3.8742917592077637
The laryngeal mask represents a safe alternative to intubation, provided there is close cooperation with the ENT surgeon.	3.4197484436186407
Topical corticosteroids (CS) are frequently used to treat of allergic contact dermatitis, so that their own potential for sensitization is rarely detected.	3.7708674759374903
However, increasing numbers of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported during the last 10 years, and allergic skin reactions to over 50 particular compounds have been observed.	3.685099576070402
CS must now be regarded as a rather frequent contact allergen, the prevalence being twice as high in women as in men.	3.516603337016896
Contact allergy to CS is clinically characterized by a chronic and persistent, corticosteroid-resistant dermatitis.	3.285813127321697
In general, hypersensitivity to CS is a type I and/or type IV mediated allergic reaction.	3.638954405090668
Cross-sensitivity between individual corticosteroid preparations has been described owing to their closely related chemical structures (e.g.	2.8088833899492753
hydrocortisone and tixocortol pivalate).	3.3142856481031937
Contact allergy to CS can be confirmed by patch-tests, intradermal injection tests or application tests; because of the delayed appearance of positive skin reactions a prolonged evaluation period of up to 120 h is recommended.	3.1716397476127542
For routine screening the use of the patient's own material and of tixocortol pivalate and budesonide as test marker substances seems appropriate.	3.4126429776801754
The development of further marker substances is a target for ongoing research.	2.9102596418873863
The alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process.	3.7198035741086586
The historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts, these being the implicit "standard alliance" of Freud, Zetzel's therapeutic alliance and Greenson's working alliance, are to be described.	3.3381666356873096
All alliance concepts refer to a general, essentially reality-oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain, which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work.	3.5107702794017097
Nonetheless, the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference.	3.2849549500391615
The alliances are therefore not faced with the transference, but rather with the resistance.	3.5444836501208155
We report on a 15-months-old girl with a history of recurrent phlegmones of the lower eyelid, dacryocystitides, conjunctivities and mucositis together with growth-retardation, chronic obstipation and anal prolaps.	2.9853311576455113
During a period of 19 days absolute neutropenia was observed.	3.0241993478914373
Retrospectively, neutrophil counts were between 0-500/µl from birth on.	2.9553158576254046
Bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of granulopoiesis at the stage of promyelocytes.	2.9667079072317954
Continuous therapy with 10  µg/kg/d of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) induced 12-day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts.	3.2126300415855202
There were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines.	2.8941212574763213
Growth retardation and prolaps of anus normalized, and few intercurrent bacterial infections, pneumonia and impetigo contagiosa occurred.	2.790670808052571
A mutation in the G-CSF-receptor gene was not found in this patient.	3.947231068893363
After 2 years of therapy, a reduction of rhG-CSF dose (application every 2 days) lead to a severe neutropenia.	4.054367567486064
We report a 31-year-old renal transplant patient treated with cyclosporin A who developed an unusual sebaceous gland hyperplasia accompanied by a disseminated follicular spiny hyperkeratosis.	3.066808067335134
Those alterations were most evident on his face and limbs.	3.3703844539716186
In some locations hairy hyperkeratosis with authentic hair neogenesis was found.	2.71562357106637
The histology of these alterations showed a marked hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles with formation of hair-like spikes either alone or in connection with hairs.	3.6787050342436776
The presence of true hairs distinguishes our case from the morphologically similar disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and other spiny keratinization disorders.	2.5802712191350956
Scanning electron microscopy helped to demonstrate the hair-like structure of these keratoses.	3.329030297732253
Some of the sebaceous glands showed cystic widening of their lumina, which were filled with abundant amorphous eosinophilic material, a finding similar to earlier observations.	2.9177269195387683
Our case demonstrates that these skin alterations should be classified as side effects of cyclosporin A and that they are apparently dose-dependent.	3.120305443084775
Background: Since increased intraoperative iris irritation can lead to increased postoperative inflammation, we are interested in postoperative reactions to several varied surgical procedures.	3.2682470238080255
We performed pupil stretching, iridotomy with iris suture, and partial sphincterectomy.	2.8551476556680724
Reports of accidental alkaloid-intoxications with plants of the nightshade family, in  particular Datura-species are well known in pediatric care.	3.1840714448415524
The intentional abuse as a hallucinogenic drug in adolescents became more frequent in recent years.	3.0435292319007274
Two patients, a 14- resp.	3.3533803769045747
16-year old boy were admitted to the intensive care units of our hospitals  because of a severe central anticholinergic syndrome after ingestion of tea from Angel's Trumpet blossoms for experimental reasons.	3.6555282105719247
Patient's history in the first somnolent patient was not available at the time of admission, a routine immunological drug screening of the patient's urine had been negative.	4.10778600753078
In the present case of a granular cell tumor an abdomino-thoracal resection of the esophagus was performed in a 41-year-old patient after preoperative diagnosis had suggested esophageal cancer.	3.714423343009456
Granular cell tumors (Abrikossoff's tumor) of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis.	4.085408226716845
Diagnosis can be obtained by endoscopic and histological study and immunohistochemical forceps biopsy.	3.4404545962260102
Because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor, it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma.	3.4980164538305485
In the guidelines for determination of the blood alcohol level for forensic purposes, a correction factor of 1.2 has been established for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol based on the relationship of the water content between serum and whole blood.	3.780959992587043
The reliability of the determination of the blood alcohol level is dependent on the possible minimum and maximum values of this correction factor.	3.0929808899594526
In a comprehensive multicenter study consisting of 833 samples, which can be considered representative of persons involved in offences under the drinking and driving act, an average quotient of 1.16 was found with minimum and maximum values of 1.08 and 1.21 respectively.	2.944819620657671
In 96% of the cases the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19 and the deviation of the quotient from the average value was less than 3%.	3.617085262265268
From these results it can be assumed that the determination of blood alcohol is obviously more reliable than previously presumed.	3.6418446455166382
In Germany, if the dermatologist has definite proof that a patient's skin disorder is severe or chronic, work-related and requiring a change in occupation, then he or she must issue a Berufskrankheitenanzeige (loosely translated as occupational disease notification).	2.9575981192647696
The patient's consent is not required for this mandatory form, which has to be submitted even if the patient is opposed.	4.207917424122527
On the other hand, if there is only a possible connection between the occupation and the skin disorder, or if the skin disease is neither severe nor chronic nor threatening pursuit of the occupation, then the dermatologist needs only write a Hautarztbericht (dermatologist's report).	2.9518033132563093
The patient's permission is required for this less formal document.	3.369427003573527
Bone marrow involvement is often observed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.	3.7674764903982805
Sensitive immunological and molecular biological methods allow the detection of isolated transformed cells in bone marrow samples.	3.665184937515368
Like normal hematopoietic cells, tumor cells interact with bone marrow stroma through adhesion molecules.	3.180834143382564
Since adhesion mulecules play an essential role in the invasion and proliferation of malignant cells, new therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are conceivable.	3.2891061578607603
With the development of powerful computer systems, computer-assisted medical diagnosis and therapy have become common over the last 10 years.	4.0173070182846065
Even in the surgical field, computer- and robotic-assisted techniques are becoming practical but are not yet used on a daily basis.	3.3601110788296538
In the orthopaedic field, computer and robotic assistance is used in planning and performing demanding three-dimensional osteotomies, setting pedicle screws in the spine and milling the femoral medullary canal in total hip replacement.	3.203147732660778
This article introduces a computer- and robotic-assisted system for performing arthroplasty in total knee replacement procedures.	2.914890655749315
The hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man's work.	3.7171170819581523
The multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality, sensibility, motor function and stability.	3.7385737076463346
In severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor.	4.599148472035062
In a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand.	4.379678784337566
The cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw.	2.995525471560704
Basically, we recommend an extended primary repair.	3.9082753809214363
After the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures.	3.458090858931296
We start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints.	3.7360391889755116
Thereafter, suturing of extensor and flexor tendons.	2.935724176076427
Then, we do the microsurgical reconstructions of vessels and nerves.	3.3775159618858384
In case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap.	3.4736418173080077
In a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first.	3.5987422212667606
Our results in vitality and sensibility are listed.	2.884481817693366
In the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important.	3.49208946881105
Therefore, it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery.	3.223623911344475
A 34-year-old women had a hen's egg-sized supernumerary mammary gland with no nipple or areola in the left anterior axillary line for the last 8 years.	2.8540157952967493
The main complaint about the axillary "lump" was that it was aesthetically displeasing, and it was excised.	3.271112182720734
The importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma.	3.123594811849603
Early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended.	2.96546794090582
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent drugs that are effective in the treatment of malignant tumors.	3.9754182498152093
The cytotoxic action of these drugs is not fully understood, but it appears to be mediated mainly through mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis.	3.8091183882117834
Because no information is available on the antiangiogenesis action of docetaxel, the investigations were performed to determine whether inhibition of neoangiogenesis plays a role in docetaxel's antitumor efficacy.	3.5146807724430906
Four different mouse tumors, two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC-IV; SCC-VII) and two adenocarcinomas (MCA-4; MCA-29) were assayed for angiogenic activity using the in vivo i.c.	2.9988535599774173
Tumor cells (5 x 105) were injected i.c.	3.36644894187834
into the skin flap over the abdominal wall, and the number of new blood vessels at the tumor cell injection site was determined 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days later.	4.487982341005281
The mice were treated with docetaxel (Taxotere - 31.3 mg/kg i.v.)	3.4074521415779864
1 or 4 days after tumor cell injection.	3.937818511431413
The number of new blood vessels increased with time.	2.9649174724996104
Docetaxel reduced the number of newly formed blood vessels in MCAs, but not in SCCs.	4.141901725555778
The reduction was associated with slower tumor growth.	3.4338753256615844
In a separate set of experiments we observed that docetaxel's inhibitory effect on the two MCAs was histologically associated with massive tumor cell destruction by means of both apoptosis and necrosis.	3.2344048228549642
This was not observed for the two SCCs.	3.5997600862214374
Since no reduction in blood vessels occurred in tumors unresponsive to docetaxel, the inhibition of neoangiogenesis in docetaxel-responsive tumors was likely the result of a decrease in angiogenic stimuli due to docetaxel's destruction of tumor cells.	3.285555359909634
A patient on long term parenteral nutrition developed acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin changes.	2.9063083639684266
Just as in the autosomal recessive disorder, acrodermatitis enteropathica, the lesions in our patient were caused by zinc deficiency.	3.6083461281439684
Replacement therapy with zinc led to rapid improvement.	3.213349643923944
A measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants.	3.071017645483978
The implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the eardrum and the inner ear.	2.740149539535835
A defined signal within the frequency range of 0-5 kHz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is  measured by a probe microphone.	3.241924137574793
Displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of 5 nm.	3.236586644149423
The transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal.	3.4164836463769213
This work details the measurement system and demonstrates basic influences on the sound-transmission of middle ear implants.	3.0090237717197854
In acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to PTCA regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events.	3.1650561937931148
It is, however, uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting.	3.424134516167427
We, therefore, assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary PTCA and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result (provisional stenting).	4.593909427743698
The Sulla 808V anaesthesia ventilator (Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) is originally not equipped with a fresh-gas decoupling (FGD) device.	2.8835582111914877
Recently, a low-cost FGD device (Carbamed, Bern-Liebefeld, Switzerland) has been developed, which can be inserted into the circle system.	3.3598282258100975
We investigated the effect of this device on MV in the Sulla 808V anaesthesia apparatus.	3.2203686323525744
Background: In a multicenter study the association of psychosocial stress and the use of psychosocial support in patients with diabetes mellitus was evaluated.	4.282388599636311
The diagnosis Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) in the neonate is difficult because features like neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems are easily misdiagnosed as a consequence of peripartal asphyxia.	3.1669157902817413
Craniofacial abnormalities like narrow bifrontal diameter, almond shaped palpebral fissures and openend downturned mouth are underdiagnosed especially if respiratory treatment is necessary.	2.642377648890722
Hypogonadism in girls and in milder expression in boys (for example cryptorchism) are common and unspecific signs at that age.	3.1721877009419397
Typical features like obesity and hyperphagia, small hands and feet and small stature are not expressed until the second year.	3.1315973766544056
The clinical course of PWS in the neonate is demonstrated in two cases.	3.297023000707803
Diagnostic criteria and therapeutic intervention are discussed.	3.461867590216922
Hydrops fetalis as a seldom feature in PWS has to be taken into consideration.	3.0682129652912784
Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are an instrument for classification of inpatient cases.	3.588932586285106
Targets for using DRGs are hospital financing and budgeting, cost accounting and quality assurance.	3.1822012140672795
The present survey covering 18 countries shows that so far DRGs are most frequently used for budgeting purposes.	2.993246947374424
In addition to DRG-based reimbursement, further quality assurance is necessary, but this is only being implemented with hesitation.	3.101676282404961
The coverage planned for all inpatient cases through DRG-based reimbursement in Germany from 2003 on is a pioneering challenge internationally.	2.818642673150984
Background: By law, applicants for driver's licenses not only have to have sufficient vision, but also have to use this sight reliably.	3.192765758131685
The nystagmus patient takes advantage of ocularly induced head turns and other forms of compensation.	3.0337272560573885
Sinde the introduction of the bladder drainage technique, the number of pancreas transplants performed has now reached 1000/year worldwide.	3.8016905282601487
Most of these transplants have been performed in the United States.	3.5749620055831235
In contrast, the number of pancreas transplants performed in the Eurotransplant community has remained at a low level for several years.	3.1203999749825653
The results of a consecutive series of 20 simultaneous pancreas/kidney grafts (SPK) performed between June 1994 and October 1995 demonstrate that high graft function rates of 83.5 % for pancreas and kidney grafts can be achieved.	2.7622102967451796
Therefore SPK can be recommended as a standard procedure for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease in Germany, too.	4.113949169318086
Intubation and Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation (PEEP) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function, particularly following blunt chest trauma.	3.5822158359550826
Complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) have only gained minor popularity.	2.983627012981834
In a prospective study, 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with CPAP administered by mask.	3.7632600865017496
The regime consisted of continuous administration of CPAP by a face-mask, with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing.	2.987987461556555
Initially a FiO2 of 0.33 (range 0,28-0,38) proved necessary.	3.4336593476652117
The initial CPAP level was 7 mbar (range 5-8) with an (Assisted Spontaneous Breathing) ASB of 15 mbar (range 13-18).	3.312801507191922
FiO2 and CPAP/ASB levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary.	3.0645081625089055
In all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen.	3.0159923676460783
The treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur.	3.1598020345293545
In comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average ICU stay was dramatically reduced, principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation.	3.0809734830117113
Other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery, both physical and psychological.	3.046387966178095
We conclude that non-invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications.	3.8160883711156384
Abstract:  Clinical findings and the correct assessment of the morphology and degree of stenosis is a decidant point in the conservative and operative therapy of carotid stenosis.	4.058354307414492
Diagnosis should be reached fast, sure and cost-effective with a high sensitivity and specifity.	3.8874731513807785
Current methods for articular cartilage repair are unpredictable with respect to clinical success.	3.584909509114728
In the present study, we investigated the ability of cells from articular cartilage, perichondrium, and costochondral resting zone to form new cartilage when loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into calf muscle pouches of nu/nu mice.	2.8602390349444393
Prior in vitro studies showed that platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), but not transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor, or bone morphogenetic protein-2 promoted proliferation and extracellular matrix sulfation of resting zone chondrocytes without causing the cells to exhibit a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype.	3.4140248636280552
TGF-1 has also been shown to stimulate chondrogenesis by multipotent chondroprogenitor cells like those in the perichondrium.	3.4927785903076756
In addition, PDGF-BB has been shown to modulate chondrogensis by resting zone cells implanted in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds.	2.8963956634802797
In the present study we examined whether the cartilage formation is dependent on state of chondrocyte maturation and whether the pretreatment of chondrocytes with growth factors has an influence on the cartilage formation.	3.2983941988512293
Scaffolds were manufactured from 80 % PLG with a 75:25 lactide:glycolide ratio and 20 % modified PLG with a 50:50 lactide:glycolide ratio (PLG-H scaffolds).	2.901031256073468
For each experimental group, four nude mice received two identical implants, one in each calf muscle resulting in an N = 8 implants: PLG-H scaffolds alone; PLG-H scaffolds with cells derived from either the femoral articular cartilage, costochondral periochondrium, or costochondral resting zone cartilage of 125 g male Sprague-Dawley rats; PLG-H scaffolds with either articular chondrocytes or resting zone chondrocytes that were pretreated with 37,5 ng/ml rhPDGF-BB for 4 h or 24 h before implantation, or with perichondrial cells treated with PDGF-BB plus 0,22 ng/ml rhTGF-1 for 4 h and 24 h. At 4 or 8 weeks after implantation, samples were harvested and analyzed histomorphometrically for new cartilage formed, area of residual implant and area of fibrous connective tissue.	2.847235318754309
Only resting zone cells showed the ability to form new cartilage at a heterotopic site in this study.	3.507650158315825
There was no neocartilage found in nude mice with implants loaded with either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells.	2.4490469419350127
Pretreatment of resting zone chondrocytes for 4 h prior to implantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed cartilage after 8 weeks and suppressed chondrocyte hypertrophy.	3.7823388003115332
The amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells decreased with time, whereas the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing resting zone chondrocytes pretreated with PDGF-BB was increased.	2.696825261388488
The results showed that resting zone cells can be successfully incorporated into biodegradable porous PLG scaffolds and can induce new cartilage formation in a non-weight-bearing site.	3.339403273895783
Articular chondrocytes as well as perichondrial cells did not have the capacity for neochondrogenesis when implanted heterotopically in this model.	3.8134763946858885
Bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity.	4.075811475696696
In spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological resemblance to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis.	2.5695576919391088
The biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation.	4.042922918116607
In this study the rate of proliferation of 64 bone tumors (30 high-grade central osteosarcomas, 6 low-grade osteosarcomas, 8 giant cell tumors, 8 aneurysmatic bone cysts, 5 osteoidosteomas/osteoblastomas, 7 fibrous dysplasias and 5 cases of a myositis ossificans) were analysed.	3.3473919829112644
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody.	3.442519085418879
MIB-1 recognizes the proliferation-associated Ki-67 protein which is expressed during the active phases of the cell cycle but cannot be detected in senescent cells.	3.3496720577981587
Among high-grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation (average value 30 %) was found in comparison with low-grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors.	4.117410972096744
However distinguishing low-grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible, although interestingly, the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans, a purely reactive lesion, was in the range of the values determined for high-grade osteosarcoma.	3.9126285369472837
Over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee.	3.572482290972213
Among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials, the central bone patellar tendon bone graft, a quadrupled hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.	3.1118591429942115
With some limitations, allograft materials can also be used.	3.546411664249379
Each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties, graft fixation and graft incorporation.	3.081417785269616
Clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others.	3.4806774003070986
When choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered.	3.773302819141153
For the treatment of multiple ligament injuries and for revision cases, thorough preoperative planning is necessary and modified graft selection may be required.	3.5424162652772213
Myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions.	3.1413263812151686
Frequent causes are intercurrent infections, fluctuations due to the natural history of the disease and insufficient immunosuppressive treatment prior to the crisis.	3.9844327970526714
Early referral to an experienced neurologist is essential.	3.2495914279454405
Specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with clucocorticoids.	2.926776812114837
Infections must be treated vigorously.	3.4274451220823745
Thymectomy in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized.	4.341710890494892
In cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties, early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed.	3.0333610209693593
Adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications adversely affecting prognosis.	3.415647420346604
Whenever it can be achieved, the best therapy of myasthenic crisis is its prevention by appropriate long-term management and follow-up of patients with myasthenia gravis.	4.4428024413982286
In a retrospective analysis we evaluated 48 patients who had been arthroscopically treated for tendinitis calcarea.	3.2336903921120483
The calcific deposit was removed whenever possible and all patients were treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression.	3.7861706144853935
In subjects who showed subacromial stenosis by X-ray or by intraoperative findings, an arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed.	3.2930463865397126
At follow-up all patients were evaluated according to the Constant score.	4.640361206766825
Additionally all pre- and postoperative X-rays were reviewed.	3.481488112551411
After surgery the Constant score significantly improved.	3.172005339244987
In all cases where acromioplasty was performed, a flattening of the bony configuration was achieved.	3.399008861365248
The X-ray analysis showed that no calcific deposit with blurred borders converted to sharp borders.	3.150741385432918
Patients with disappearance of the calcific deposit postoperatively had significantly better outcome than patients with no change in the X-ray.	3.275153858431432
The aim of arthroscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis has to be the removal of the calcific deposit.	4.434305070207148
Acromioplasty does not lead to further improvement of the result.	4.604542489305213
Preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity (H2ms (sucralfate, antacids, pirenzepine) and to normalize gastric mucosal microcirculation (sucralfate, pirenzepine).	2.956540463288761
Thus, the most important prophylactic measure is an optimized emergency and ICU regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation.	3.4018196709720057
All specific drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled studies.	3.3756721775166407
Furthermore, pirenzepine has been found to be superior to H2-antagonists, at least in neurosurgical patients.	3.2181230317299225
Insufficient or no data exist to support the use of prostaglandins or omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.	3.545848395335136
The most important adverse effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis is nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric alkalinization.	2.724900666320961
This may occur in long-term ventilated patients with a gastric pH>4 and may account for up to 50% of all nosocomial pneumonias in certain groups of patients.	4.2259902769073205
Mortality is not influenced by antacids or H2-antagonists, while sucralfate has been shown to reduce mortality, most probably by inhibition of bacterial translocation.	3.340493503772185
Three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy, a 66-year-old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure.	3.094979749063908
Malignant tumor cells were discovered within extensive pleural effusion.	3.409391694919499
Computed tomography revealed two lesions of the liver suspicious of metastases, and recurrent blood in the stools was evident.	3.4423225782843376
The patient deteriorated rapidly and died 3 weeks after admission.	3.284794730237394
Autopsy findings included an adenocarcinoma of the cecum (grade II) with metastases to the liver.	3.5706152188081086
High-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of plasmoblastic differentiation was diagnosed, located within the mediastinal soft tissue and infiltrating the peri- and myocardium.	2.847844016415045
Mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged with histological verification of malignant lymphoma.	3.7009966171922724
The lymphatic tumor masses had caused considerable compression of the heart and vessels, leading to the signs of cardiac failure.	4.015064562856117
The development of metastasizing colonic carcinoma and high-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 3 years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy must be considered an unusual combination.	3.295721168994671
Malignant lymphomas following heart transplantation have been described several times.	3.6609602910934607
Infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance.	3.6010471542854603
For internal control, they may only be used under the condition of homogeneous data collection and evaluation according to identical standard operating procedures during the entire investigation period.	3.0126268853287232
For inter-hospital comparison, they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable.	3.205267684287241
A survey of the infection rates published during the last 6 years in the German traumatological literature (n = 71) indeed shows (concerning series later than 1985) similar infection rates for procedures in less and in more problematic anatomical regions and in clean and contaminated situations of about 2 - 3%, after open injuries sporadically max.	3.4598400838862378
Finally, it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general "risk of infection" based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa.	3.9586779348448595
We strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection.	3.5372334288819833
The differentiation between deep and superficial infection should be abandoned.	3.2233637652063503
For all mentioned "infection rates" it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement.	3.967918163074488
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are useful techniques for the objective documentation of the relation between the femoral head and the acetabulum after closed or open reduction of a developmental dislocation of the hip joint.	3.383194911557901
Before the ossification nucleus of the femoral head is sufficiently developed, MRI is preferred.	3.4880937662336144
For the evaluation of reduction from the 2nd year on, MRI and CT are equivalent.	3.8309566615882034
CT in older patients may also be useful for 30 analysis of bony structures, e. g. for planning complex osteotomies.	4.204049544490526
Careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures.	3.9710120207091513
This is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non-unions of these carpal bones.	4.261470194577023
Conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options.	3.3500961836042777
Out of the patients who underwent surgery from January 1993 to February 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non-union were, in addition to standard X-ray examination, examined clinically and by MRI pre- and post-operatively.	4.256836621109428
Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixtion.	3.49700790012435
When there is a possibility that tissue samples have been interchanged, DNA analysis of the histological specimens can be carried out to correctly assign the specimens to a patient.	3.5852523781096117
The use of polymerase chain reaction enables results to be obtained even from degraded DNA in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples.	2.507492898843722
A review of 110 children with Burkitt's lymphoma admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during a 7-year period revealed a preponderance of males over females (1.9 : 1) and a peak incidence at five years.	3.292165230107393
The main sites affected initially by the tumour in order of frequency were the face and abdomen.	3.3246864491400525
The spinal column, spleen, and lungs were less affected.	3.373983067599669
It is postulated that an interaction between malarial and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition are important in the aetiology of the tumour.	3.220579854567352
The most effective drug is cyclophosphamide.	3.266518240841102
A combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing remissions, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse.	3.2538975581541605
Follow-up of the patients revealed good survival.	4.428151542940172
Parallel to this developement, there is a large number of reports on severe neurological, psychiatric and medical complications following the use of Ecstasy.	4.142772611188725
Seizures are among the most common clinical complications of the CNS following the ingestion of Ecstasy.	3.8585873976808074
The term "mild cognitive impairment" refers to cognitive deficits which exceed normal physiological aging processes, but do not fulfill the criteria for dementia.	2.97299100131885
The prevalence rates of four current concepts were compared in a sample of 202 healthy 60-64 year-old participants recruited from the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging (ILSE).	3.360685298908065
Furthermore, the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined.	3.0401340085861706
The following prevalence rates were determined: 13.5% for age-associated memory impairment, 6.5% for age-consistent memory impairment, 1.5% for late-life forgetfulness and 23.5% for aging-associated cognitive decline.	2.917764773437265
Subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests.	3.410671510816389
Significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales.	2.8881634400958256
Significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status.	3.2540302829291563
Longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts.	3.5091845477364023
In a retrospective study, we evaluated 180 patients treated for painful spondylolisthesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion.	3.68244753639583
Group I included 90 patients treated by anterior fusion with the transperitoneal approach.	3.2035080025886638
Group II included 90 patients operated on with a retroperitoneal approach.	3.164779103685161
Group II showed a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis L5/S1 (4 %), tear of the common iliac vein (1 %), postsympathectomy syndrome (4 %) and reversible L4 nerve-root lesion (3 %).	4.274104589934726
On the basis of our findings, we recommend the transperitoneal approach for anterior interbody fusion L5 to S1 or L4 to S1.	3.0632330956601943
Coronary surgery is at this point of time the standard therapy of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis.	3.973644865771319
Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is performed only in bail out situations.	3.232630523460508
The number of publications of successful percutaneous intervention in unprotected left main coronary stenosis is increasing because of increasing use of stents and ticlopidine to avoid stent-thrombosis.	2.72802004451197
Within the context of an extensive study of electroconvulsive therapy at the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Bonn 15 patients suffering from therapy-resistent Major depression (DSM III-R) were examined with a detailed psychometric test battery, containing memory- and nonmemory tests.	3.4776488138165376
The test battery had been applied short time before, during and after the treatment with 10 ECT applied unilateral over the nondominant hemisphere.	3.4746580338227733
Comparing the test performances before and 1-2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes: a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in 30 min delayed recall of verbal items, while visual short-term memory and visual-constructive performance showed a significant improvement (in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side).	3.712136714868451
None of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was detracted short time after the end of the ECT-treatment, instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly.	3.0757568399141966
Between responders to treatment (50% improvement in HAMD) and non-responders no significant differences neither before nor after the treatment were detected.	3.76091312698507
The non-responders had in nearly all of the tests some better (but not significantly) results despite being older than the group of responders.	3.4613997527486284
In this study we assessed the drawing abilities in 37 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.	2.5508320970099767
Drawing abilities (drawing: house, flower, clock; Rey-Osterrieth figure; copying: MMST-figure; Rey-Osterrieth figure) were quantified with different rating schemes and related to other neuropsychological assessments.	2.5775125866820576
All patients underwent a positron emission tomography with 18-FDG.	3.158317193026457
Drawing performance was highly correlated with severity of dementia - expressed in MMST scores (r=0.78; p<0.0001) - with visuo-spatial short-term memory (r=-0.69; p=0.001), and writing abilities (r=-0.77; p<0.0001).	3.3500997611886163
The summarized drawing score showed a statistically significant correlation with the rate of temporoparietal glucose metabolism measured with positron emission tomography and 18-FDG (r=0.39; p=0.017).	3.571290503177013
In the drawings of AD patients omittings and simplifications were typical, whereas perseverations rarely occured.	2.7569386305926633
In severely demented patients closing-in phenomenons could be de- scribed, too.	2.8354311726092716
A subgroup of AD patients with visuo-constructive impairment as the leading symptom could not be identified.	3.641485452221676
The good working relationship between the dermatologists in private practice and those in the clinics has been the main factor in this successful development.	3.6525273418046145
The traditional background of the following sectors is highlighted: outpatient clinic, X-ray and UV ligth treatment, allergology and occupational dermatology, psychosomatic dermatology, dermatosurgery, and phlebology.	3.266695838614998
A 12-year-old girl from Zaire with Aids (CDC: P2 D1) presented with a generalized molluscum contagiosum infection.	3.1389104601230473
She had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis and from cryptosporidiosis several months before admission.	3.188258321054512
While molluscum contagiosum infection is usually a self-limiting disease in immunocompetent persons, a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant mollusca occurs with advanced immunodeficiency.	3.200968462286353
Histological and immunohistological examinations showed a severe diminution of Langerhans and T cell populations that might enhance the dissemination of the infection.	3.0150617266137396
Molluscum-like lesions of cryptococci have been described, and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	3.793317809079146
Further differential diagnoses should include American and African histoplasmosis, and the cutaneous manifestations of mycobacterial infections, of toxoplasmosis and of Pneumocystis carinii infection.	3.5198587791363236
The search for vascular structures in skin tumors by incident light microscopy has revealed a surprisingly high proportion of vascularized tumours.	3.076825575187367
Characteristic vascular patterns, in some cases highly tumour-specific, have been defined.	4.159927150578147
The vascular structure is a valuable feature for characterization and differentiation of skin tumours, especially for amelanotic malignant melanoma.	3.576368223045905
We propose a flowchart procedure for analysis and diagnosis of skin tumours using incident light microscopy, which appears to be valuable for advanced image analytic techniques.	3.148096633579214
Introduction: The treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily.	3.4879431942781527
Current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation (OCT) and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT).	3.3396609625262914
Methods: With a prospective clinical investigation, at the time being with 2-year results, we have examined ACT in comparison to OCT in 20 patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological (histology, immunohistochemistry, RES) outcome.	4.93858154842024
Results: We found equally good results with both methods in Lysholm, Meyers and Tegner Activity Scores.	2.926612965726777
Histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after ACT showed a defect filling in all cases, mainly with fibrous cartilage, while localized areas of hyalinelike regenerative cartilage were documented near the base.We did not see any histomorphologically visible change in the transplants after OCT.	2.9906338955676595
Conclusion: At the time we prefer OCT instead of ACT given the correct indication.	3.325028601478302
This case report intends to focus attention on hemodynamic TIAs as cause of repetitive involuntary movements (RIMs) as differential diagnosis of simple partial motor seizures.	2.8717486267365078
Repeated EEG recordings revealed no epileptic discharges.	3.2891385174357266
In both patients, duplex ultrasonography revealed an occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) contralateral to the side of the RIMs.	3.349503986214488
Blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to ICA occlusion were reduced and vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was absent.	2.897253469874875
After elevation of blood pressure both patients became asymptomatic.	3.4989003601877986
We suggest that in patients with episodes of RIMs, Doppler sonography and tests of cerebral vascular reserve capacity should be performed to search for a hemodynamic origin of these symptoms.	3.8043363791460143
Ethylene dichloride (EDC) is used as a solvent and in the rubber, plastic, and insecticide industry.	3.5487213284983707
The fatal adult dose is below 20 ml.	3.2651033114213295
Poisoning can occur from inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption.	3.3644078584351065
EDC depresses almost all cells, but essentially those of the central nervous system, liver, kidneys, and heart.	4.32448519862838
Retrospectively analyzing the history of three patients with gastrointesinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated over a period of 1 year in the surgical department of our regional hospital, we tried to answer the following questions: using the current recommendations in the literature, how are the macro- and microscopic features and clinical presentation to be interpreted?	3.793198557158264
Which prognostic and therapeutic conclusions should we draw, giving special consideration to practice-orientated management of such cases.	3.249696929801379
The patients were 65, 75 and 88 years old respectively, and in each case the GIST manifested as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.	3.39483203980467
During surgical treatment four gastric tumors ranging in cross section between 2.5 and 8 cm were found.	2.880740436798767
The GIST diagnosis was established after light microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations.	3.280602803606489
Going through the current literature, a large number of structural and immunohistochemical criteria have come to light for determining its classification and potential malignancy.	3.5311079037917743
On the other hand, very few subsequent recommendations concerning therapy and prognosis can be found and follow-up recomendations are almost unavailable.	3.3626280420556514
We conclude that GISTs are difficult to diagnose because of their locality and that their clinical behavior is uncertain.	3.2314080631195377
The potential malignancy, on the other hand, requires a well-founded diagnostic procedure in the form of the best possible pre-therapeutic staging.	4.01378413298144
Furthermore, initially radical surgical treatment should be adopted and the follow-up should be adapted to the risk involved.	3.945954482182471
The latter is arbitrary and further clinical studies are required.	3.064529974685579
In animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs.	3.1091798709280014
According to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today, it could potentially be applied in infants in the future, too.	4.081436578233471
However, the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase III studies to be conducted.	2.8167203496430417
Further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems.	3.2564740606311826
Taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today, we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support; however, further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified.	3.251110336760713
The role of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) in primary malignant melanoma is controversial.	2.9179502056322
Our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of ELND regarding survival and disease-free survival in malignant melanoma of the trunk and extremities.	3.700413353785596
By matched-pair analysis, 375 patients treated by wide local excision (WLE) plus ELND were compared to 375 patients treated by WLE only.	3.2486696022019266
There was no difference in survival between the two treatment groups; however, the disease-free interval was significantly higher in the collective treated by WLE plus ELND (P<0.05).	3.576765933348074
Increased survival rates were noted for intermediate tumor thickness of 1.51-4.0 mm for the WLE+ELND group although the difference was not significant (P=0.14), and disease-free survival was significantly improved in this group (P<0.001).	3.967538117786112
ELND elicited a higher benefit in male patients with intermediate thickness melanoma.	3.4422313355497276
Our results confirm the findings of several studies that ELND improves the outcome after primary treament of malignant melanoma of intermediate tumor thickness.	3.657589318740463
7 patients (5 female, 2 male; age:  22-81 years; average age=58,1 J) with recurrent necrotizing ANCA-negative, non leucocytoclastic vasculitis, were enrolled into this study.	3.0958373762594866
Disease was resistant to prior conservative therapy, and therefore patients received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) - (dose: 1,0 g/kg body weight daily dose 0,25 g/kg body weight over 4 consecutive days).	3.298191643684247
All patients responded rapidly to this therapeutic regimen.	3.1570920533510383
Specifically immediate pain relief was striking.	3.839137838904894
Complete clearance of disease was observed in 5 out of 7 patients within 6 months while receiving IVIG (0,5 g/kg body weight) every 4 weeks for one year.	3.9453611831393673
In 2 out of 5 patients ulceration and vasculitis healed completly and therapy could be stopped after 6 months.	3.1269660794818046
In one patient treatment had to be discontinued due to decreasing kidney function.	3.2804109241305817
The data presented demonstrate that IVIG is an  effective and valuable therapeutic modality in treatment of severe vasculitis resistant to conventional therapy.	3.585822270960142
However consideration of costs, effectiveness and possible side effects is needed for this therapeutic regime.	3.8610576228687528
After orthopedic surgery, skeletal muscle will enter the rehabilitation process in weakened condition due to the following characteristics.	3.82745148855952
After use of a tourniquet during surgery, the muscle suffers ischemia/reperfusion damage due to oxidative stress, resulting in structural impairment.	3.876685366145202
The resulting immobilization leads to muscular atrophy, with a loss of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress being of etiological significance.	3.224708744293443
Degeneration of muscle fibers as well as regeneration occurs in muscle while still immobilized.	3.9258875770569324
After remobilization, the muscle has impaired functional capacity and frequently shows disturbances in its innervation pattern.	3.1221725044277227
High mechanical loading should therefore be avoided, and electrical stimulation may be applied to facilitate recovery.	3.7787301942600386
Considering the role of oxygen radicals, supplementation with vitamin E appears generally recommendable.	2.9814145635977223
The timing of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy - especially if combined with chemotherapy - has been a subject of interest over the past years.	4.261791605397675
This analysis was based on a literature review of mostly retrospective publications.	3.75035996204179
Data concerning the interval between surgery and radiotherapy were correlated with the locoregional control, incidence of distant metastases and prognosis of breast cancer, lung carcinoma, and head and neck carcinomas.	3.9816033972922242
The reviewed data did not show a clear relationship of the time interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy and locoregional control.	3.699678560710634
However, evaluation of the data was difficult, because in most publications, retrospective analyses were performed and other prognostically more relevant parameters may influence locoregional control stronger than the time interval.	3.6695419635963815
In patients with head and neck carcinomas, there is a negative effect of time interval between surgery and radiotherapy on local control if unfavorable factors exist, i. e., close surgical margins, unfavorable pathohistological parameters and low radiation dose.	3.1632275841768362
In patients with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy, there are inconsistent reports in the literature.	3.3187993387344537
If additional chemotherapy is necessary, the sequence surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems adequate.	3.7298490585909114
Although some data suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy due to chemotherapy may increase the risk or local recurrences, there may, on the other hand, be an increased likelihood of systemic metastases, if radiotherapy is applied before chemotherapy.	3.319941057329632
Concerning lung cancer, only one retrospective analysis exists suggesting a better survival of patients with an interval of more than 36 days between surgery and radiotherapy as compared to patients with a shorter interval.	5.120154326093448
The treatment of severely injured patients is a challenge for preclinical and clinical treatment concepts, causing financial aspects of increasing importance for the German health care system.	3.6051317583006637
A total of 32,500 polytraumatized patients (PTS III and IV) are managed in trauma center levels I-IV in Germany.	3.3002992290358426
Trauma center levels I or II are by definition capable of supporting the full range of treatment for the severely injured.	3.2866378284087805
With the baseline calculation of 64,000 DM per patient and 104 polytrauma treated per year in the Berlin Virchow Clinic, 6.66 million DM primary costs must be spent for treatment.	2.957280822439645
In Europe the distribution of trauma center levels I or II is sufficient and can be specified with 1 center per 1 million inhabitants.	3.3160050732277275
Nevertheless, the european air medical service could support more intensive use of these central trauma institutions.	2.8850984028781355
This was shown by comparing the number of polytrauma patients and the number of trauma centers.	4.6038701739526475
Less then half of these patients are treated in levels I or II trauma centers.	4.313898840399148
The financial pressure on the health system and the rising quality must lead to better utilization of trauma centers.	3.294991718285404
To meet this goal a annual treatment rate of 300-400 polytrauma patients should be aimed at.	3.099671899243751
The claim of the American College of Surgeons that a trauma surgeon should treat 50 severely injured patients per year would then be possible.	3.1701195551483505
This report is a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies given to adults in a private practice setting and furthermore a study of the stability of the therapeutic results achieved.	3.690539770098733
In the spring of 1997 a total of 16 bioenergetic therapists (6 of them medical doctors and 10 psychologists), all members of the Swiss Society of Bioenergetic Therapists (SGBAT), provided upon request a number of data on 319 patients who had terminated their therapies after a minimum of 20 sessions 6 months to 6 years earlier.	3.320157495822094
A self-evaluating questionnaire was then constructed, to be answered anonymously, and was sent to these 319 patients in late summer 1997; 290 of them could be reached and 142 (49%) returned it.	3.3105011080187166
The questionnaire contained questions related to the psychic and physical condition, to interpersonal and psychosomatic problems, and to the effect of body work on physical consciousness, cognitive insights and changes of the quality of life.	4.3576411005354485
Bioenergetic body work was judged to be important and indispensable by about half of the patients.	3.62666066546283
Regarding the stability of the therapeutic result, 107 patients indicated a stable or even improved condition.	3.2720670285265503
Of the 35 patients who since termination of the bioenergetic therapy had chosen to undergo further therapy, 16 opted again for a body-oriented psychotherapy.	2.9671904278476413
Purpose: In a clinical study 35 patients with intracranial aneurysms were examined using CT-angiography, MR-angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA).	3.524004267947525
The aim of the study was to establish the ability of noninvasive techniques to detect intracranial aneurysms.	2.901275121464853
"Classic" choroidal neovascularization (CNV) has a relatively uniform appearance in fluorescein angiography.	3.2028920415433957
In contrast, indocyanine green (ICG) angiography shows variable features of well-defined CNV.	2.8838040140670627
We examined 31 classic CNV patients secondary to age-related macular degeneration using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Angiograph) in order to determine ICG characteristics of classic CNV.	2.8685434457386956
Vascular patterns (97%), a hypofluorescent rim (84%), a hyperfluorescent margin (42%), late ICG leakage (32%) and "feeder vessels" were identified in variable frequency.	3.463533387867943
Some of the ICG characteristics may correlate with histological features of the membrane and reflect proliferative activity.	3.155895803805649
Extrafoveal "feeder vessels" may be amenable to laser photocoagulation in the presence of subfoveal CNV.	3.354583156424188
In situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in dermatopathology.	2.7969747165724788
These techniques can combine the sensitivity of PCR with the advantage of in situ hybridization to localize specific cellular structures.	3.486676842821519
With optical control of the PCR reaction product in these techniques, false-positive results due to contamination can be minimized.	3.739012105511037
Several working protocols have been established which allow detection of DNA and RNA sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner.	3.2619458360044447
Two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product, the indirect PCR in situ hybridization (PCRisHyb), and the direct in situ PCR (is PCR).	3.901939256952425
An easy and reproducible method for PCRisHyb and isPCR in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared.	2.857078434026326
Using both isPCR and PCRisHyb, the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue.	3.156053466609149
Indirect PCRisHyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct isPCR was the quicker, easier and less expensive method.	2.7615862377555156
In a randomized study 30 patients with chronic stationary psoriasis were treated with 3 different topical schemes.	4.219637687438718
Group 1 (n=10) received monotherapy (dithranol (D) twice a day, D/D), group 2 (n=10) calcipotriol mornings/dithranol evenings (calcipotriol (C)/dithranol (D) C/D) and 3 (mometasone (M) mornings/dithranol (D) evenings, M/D).	3.2202964070290396
During the therapy period of 4 weeks we documented the PASI-Score as well as infiltration, erythema and desquamation weekly.	3.832444367435642
The M/D group revealed in the first week a significantly faster reduction of the PASI-score (5,3) than in the D/D group (PASI 13,22).	4.098468970961631
The C/D group (PASI 10,5) show a not significantly faster reduction.	3.472757158186494
After 4 weeks of treatment and after a follow period of 6 weeks there were similar PASI-Scores in all groups.	3.5426028351521843
There were less side-effects in the M/D group than in the others.	3.956684341955326
The beginning, more anti-psoriatic effectiveness was achieved by the mometasone/dithranol combination than the other schemes.	3.1586472228348517
In the long term, the effects were similar.	3.71758777541036
This report describes a distinctive pattern of findings in peripheral sensory-nociceptive afferent nerves after spinal injury.	2.8785261049448376
Subsequent to trauma there was segmental, multisegmental or hemilateral hypoaesthesia with refractory, intenseful painful symptoms.	2.823185491295771
"Normal" therapy resulted in more severe symptoms.	3.569625989354469
Depending on the distribution of the hypo- or anaesthesia, there were also efferent symptoms (coordination problems, impairments of proprioception, etc.).	2.887071035618306
Colleagues who have made similar observations or are familiar with these symptoms are cordially invited to assist with the interpretation of this clinical picture.	3.4034518146915533
The pharynx, being part of the digestive as well as the respiratory system, is embedded in the complex spatial anatomy of the neck and, due to its function and location, represents a very sophisticated region.	4.51632143288379
Cisatracurium (51W89, Nimbex, Glaxo-Wellcome), an intermediate-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, is a stereoisomer of atracurium.	2.820536403494196
Histamine releasing propensities and serum tryptase level have been investigated after administration of cisatracurium (3xED95, 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) in surgical patients.	2.987447958963955
Methods: After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to receive either 3xED95 or 5xED95 cisatracurium, or 3xED90 vecuronium as a rapid bolus.	2.2989764734661424
A prick test was done the day before by scarification of the skin in the forearm.	3.7011802979241213
Six minutes after thiopentone, the patients received the relaxant, and after further 6 min 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	2.9185538933479704
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	2.1747056104515066
Plasma histamine was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 pg/ml.	3.6600302137784797
Additionally, serum tryptase was measured by RIA at baseline (-10 and  -1 min) and 15 and 60 min after the relaxant administration.	3.908999141090326
Levels for histamine >1000 pg/ml and for tryptase >2 µg/ml were considered significant.	3.427949091168199
Cutaneous signs of histamine release were documented.	3.276756015193094
Results: Ten patients showed a positive prick-test reaction.	4.067319005062498
Only after thiopentone some cutaneous signs (4 flush, 1 erythema) of histamine release were observed.	2.921241799940973
There were no cutaneous signs of histamine release correlating with cardiovascular changes.	2.910464863821424
Analysis of the blood samples demonstrated no significant increase in the histamine level in all three groups.	4.281776593163315
Only in 1 patient was a significant higher histamine level (1133 pg/ml) measured 5 min after 5xED95 cisatracurium.	3.9504148588116523
All measurements of serum tryptase were within the physiological limits.	3.6237811689166595
Discussion: In this study, with the particular time course of drug administration, neither cisatracurium nor vecuronium increased plasma histamine levels.	3.77615901420972
Only after 5xED95 cisatracurium was 1 elevated histamine level documented after 5 min.	3.004178758990269
In several studies increased histamine levels have been described, but without clinical manifestations.	3.542555278482183
It is known that cutaneous signs can occur without increased plasma histamine levels due to the structural heterogeneity of mast cells.	3.252648585386899
The cutaneous reactions in this study were caused by thiopentone.	4.250431420351196
The tryptase values were within normal limits even in the patient with histamine release.	4.057717692548052
No relationship between the positive results in the prick test and the incidence of cutaneous reactions and/or histamine release for drugs used in the induction of anaesthesia was observed.	4.613847909746928
Whether cisatracurium has a potential for immunologic release is unknown.	3.354887133970002
We report on a psychosis caused by application of a transdermal scopolamine patch for over 15 days.	2.9666652011414114
In the literature there is no mention of a case in which scopolamine had such an influence nor are any cases reported in which paranoid-hallucinatory symptoms cortinued 11 days after removing the patch.	3.217867025359766
Bone and joint tuberculosis, as all other types of tuberculosis is generally treated with antituberculotic combination chemotherapy.	3.0640527681202987
This has to be continued for a minimum of six months, or nine months in case of extensive spreading.	4.348137680423704
A two- to three-month initial phase with four or five different drugs (H, R, Z, and additionally E and/or S) is followed by a four- to six-month therapy with H and R alone, provided the pathogen is fully susceptible to a standard regimen.	3.2994775148030797
The main side effects are hepatotoxic or allergic reactions.	3.280918825588282
A frequent contra-indication is existing, often toxicity-induced, liver damage.	2.9682586214972653
The main local complications requiring surgery are spinal instability or neurologic deficiencies.	2.9934819818835754
This report concerns the case of a patient who had suffered a massive pulmonary embolus and for whom, despite immediately administered thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA it became necessary to initiate reanimation procedures.	3.397879840405939
The patient was subsequently admitted to our cardiac surgery clinic for the purpose of operative intervention.	3.3492798633928533
After femorofemoral coupling on the heart-lung machine, right ventricular relieve was rapidly attained.	3.0399603736469722
During the course of a 3-hour period of extracorporal circulation, the initially significantly elevated pulmonary pressures were able to be reduced to moderate levels.	3.9391605511838654
Correspondingly, right ventricular recovery could be echocardiographically determined.	3.248402947629129
As a consequence of this development, and after preclusion the presence of any large thrombotic masses which might have been situated in the pulmonary trunk, it was possible to forego thoracotomy and embolectomy.	3.6675458505538163
This procedure allowed, on the one hand, the avoidance of imminent right ventricular failure through the use of the heart-lung machine.	3.851448652843512
On the other, due to the lessening of the degree of surgical intervention, the risk of grave hemorrhaging as a result of concurrent thrombolytic therapy could be minimalized.	4.169459391868442
After an uneventful course, the patient was able to be transferred on the second postoperative day with normal pulmonary pressure values.	4.1424429983186295
Objectives Correction of bone deformities at metaphyseo-epiphyseal level of long bones through a corticotomy and gradual distraction.	2.846431287091823
Restoration of shape and function of lower limb.	3.593379973584875
Morbidity and mortality are infrequent in countries where induced abortion is legal and medically well organized, but widespread in many developing countries where it is either illegal or inaccessible.	2.8217456423317295
We observed two patients with stone formation in the renal pelvis two and five years after pyeloplasty.	3.6671500929455654
In both cases there was no obstruction of the pyeloureteral junction detectable.	3.4325305238746564
For stone removal we favourite an endoscopic procedure, in which a removal of residuums of the suture is even possible as the verification of the pyeloureteral junction.	3.4930337762894506
Aim of the study: The aim was to determine the efficiency of a secure control of ventilation in emergency medicine by using capnometry.	3.904846110836635
This question was of special interest for mechanically ventilated patients with cerebral diseases, because here hyperventilation as well as hypoventilation can result in severe consequences.	3.9563206547802343
The advent of the excimer laser has brought about the potential for improved vision in many individuals with myopia and astigmatism.	3.1695574968069438
However, photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) remains a matter of controversy.	2.5217307552035586
The purpose of our study was to determine the predictability of VISX 20/20 excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy in the treatment of myopic astigmatism.	2.9415253095794585
Starting a specific immunotherapy (SIT) and its maintenance may be lifesaving for the allergic patients.	3.119780829942647
Performing a prospective study, we exactly documented effects and side effects during the induction phase of SIT using a purified aqueous yellow jacket venom preparation in 20 patients allergic to yellow jacket venom (clinical degree II-IV).	3.3255599874215376
Indication for the therapy was defined individually for each patient and was based on a score incorporating the following criteria: a) clinical symptoms, b) in-vivo- and in-vitro testing, c) risk of re-sting.	4.175388211921879
SIT was started under inpatient conditions following a standardized 8 day protocol.	3.2302932688383876
At the end of the induction phase all patients tolerated the maintenance dose of 100 µg of yellow jacket venom without complications even though all showed local side effects (threshold doses 0.01-10 µg, median value 0.2 µg).	3.010839469551743
40% of all patients showed subjective side effects (median value of threshold dose 30 µg, range 0.2-60 µg) and 30% showed objective side effects (median value of threshold dose 55 µg, range 20-80 µg); however, all side effects were clinically mild.	3.1538986109433815
When objective systemic side effects were seen, the cumulative daily dose was 39-210 µg (median value 135 µg), exceeding 100 µg in 83% of patients.	3.323723417843416
Our prospective study confirmed that the chosen protocol for SIT is effective in inducing tolerance to the venom preparation.	3.1360675378800438
However, using a purified aqueous yellow jacket preparation did not result in reduction of side effects.	2.950744913792339
A 76 year old patient with actinic reticuloid was treated with Cyclosporin A.	4.013321343389819
11 months after beginning the immunosuppressive therapy, he developed lymphoedema and livid nodular skin lesions of the right leg, which histologically showed Kaposi's sarcoma.	3.879123825165066
After stopping the Cyclosporin A and intralesional therapy with Interferon alpha, no regression of the Kaposi sarcoma could be seen.	3.0457389916142086
The development of Kaposi sarcoma during immunosuppressive therapy for actinic reticuloid has not been previously described.	2.956950308017716
This analysis was undertaken to review the outcome and toxicity of postoperative adjuvant therapy for Stage II and III rectal cancer.	3.4499328484158527
We reviewed 112 patients treated with radiotherapy (44 patients) and radiochemotherapy (68 patients) after potentially curative (R0) surgery for rectal cancer (UICC Stages II and III), between 1983 and 1994 at the University Clinic of Würzburg.	3.48952904487277
Median radiation dose was 56 Gy (range: 45 to 66 Gy).	3.0802858120995777
Chemotherapy consisted of 4 to 6 courses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (420 mg/m2/d) and leucovorin (200 mg/m2/d).	3.698080747862111
Median follow-up was 37 months.	4.330292940089177
The overall survival was 84% for patients with UICC Stage II and 45% for patients with UICC Stage III disease (p = 0.0045).	3.161636304350738
There were no statistically significant differences between patients treated with radiochemotherapy vs radiotherapy in terms of 5-year survival (63% after radiochemotherapy vs 53% after radiotherapy, p = 0.16), relapse-free survival (52% vs 50%) and locoregional control (69% vs 67%).	3.555208617203199
UICC Stage III disease was associated with high failure rates (40% pelvic recurrences and 53% distant metastases).	3.4871141459203665
There was a statistically significant difference in terms of the incidence of distant metastases between the 2 treatment modalities for patients with Stage III disease (49% 5-year probability for developing distant metastases after radiochemotherapy vs 66% after radiotherapy, p = 0.047).	3.813158925969789
In a multivariate analysis, the addition of chemotherapy, lymph node stage and grading were independent prognostic factors for survival.	3.348841050315457
Severe late toxicity was documented in 5% of treated patients.	3.603090611189136
Prognosis of patients with UICC Stage III rectal cancer remains poor after "standard" surgery followed by postoperative adjuvant treatment (pelvic radiotherapy and bolus intravenous injection of 5-FU and leucovorin).	3.366694164280151
Major efforts should be made in order to improve prognosis for these patients, including optimization of surgical treatment and systemic treatment.	5.0741105802437305
More effective multimodality treatment strategies should be investigated in prospective randomized trials.	3.5173959302305815
Andy Warhol underwent dermabrasion in 1957 because of a nasal skin lesion, which is best diagnosed as a rhinophyma on the basis of the available biographical literature.	4.182355764747954
Throughout his creative life, the artist worked on different aspects of plastic surgery especially in the nasal area.	3.4636090481933346
As one of the founders of Pop-Art, Warhol left essential marks on the modern society and influenced our standards of aesthetic shapes.	2.887343913972325
Objective: The clinical activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not reliably reflected by laboratory measures.	3.2519476933481077
Proteolytic enzymes involved in the cascade of joint destruction are potentially useful parameters to monitor the extent of joint inflammation in RA.	3.8532507605185713
This study compares the validity of two classes of proteolytic enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsin B, H, and L) as well as their respective inhibitors to serve as parameters of RA disease activity.	2.932876304563358
A 47 year old male patient with Miller-Fisher-syndrome did not respond to treatment with plasmapheresis and intravenous high dose 7 S immune globulins.	3.253218506203004
Only cerebrospinal fluid pheresis, administered as final alternative, lead to definite improvement and cure.	3.034359639503942
Invasive selective coronary angiography as a clinical method is about 40 years old.	3.58220447013902
This article surveying this period, written by an R&D engineer, deals with four parts: first the situation before 1965 is touched upon.	2.7142984213047106
For the time after 1965 the second and third parts describe the development of the procedure and of the technique with special reference to the work of Prof. Dr. K. Bachmann and to the facility, which in 1967 was designed together with him and further developed.	3.978300588061861
K. Bachmann had already taken up the method of invasive coronary angiography around 1965, which makes him one of the group of pioneering users who developed the fundamentals of the procedure and led coronary angiography to its self-evident use today.	3.6283590623359276
The first clinical application of high resolution image intensifiers with the input screen produced from evaporated cesium iodide in 1971 appears as one of the highlights of the continuous improvements of the facility.	3.0367233891587544
The fourth part of the article sketches the status of today and, considering the new methods using MRI, EBCT as well as CT, it predicts that the invasive coronary angiography will remain an indispensable method at least for the medium-term future.	3.519750086309925
Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole) have revolutionized the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention.	3.438039773157186
These substances inhibit the H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of H2-receptor-antagonists.	3.1505298339023016
Since then, sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated.	3.7968891224128436
Omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older.	3.478223493588612
A new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients.	2.944714268999556
The main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies.	3.457278258894029
In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics.	3.729918241326247
The recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0,7-1,4 mg/kg bodyweight and day.	4.104081037906262
However, some children with ulcerative esophagitis may need daily doses up to 3.5 mg/kg.	3.039086022446053
Healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy.	3.50412701503586
After remission, doses can often be reduced for maintenance therapy.	3.1580866719619918
Side effects are rare and do not seem to increase with higher doses.	4.112365623167505
Possibly interactions with other medications, i.e.	3.0644573362894523
antiepileptic drugs, may occur.	3.8203031979624638
A long-term therapy lasting more than 6 months in a child should be monitored by an experienced pediatric gastroenterologist.	3.767770254997005
The resection itself, postoperative catheterization and the prostate are possible causes of these infections.	3.5584968143730156
In this prospective study we investigated the influence of bacterial prostatic colonization on the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections and inflammatory complications.	3.6497297157789803
In 78 patients we observed in 42 cases (53,8%) a bacterial prostatitis.	3.4837234953749894
In 14 patients (17,9%) we found nosocomial UTI's and in 12 patients (15,4%) inflammatory complications.	4.093102618578732
The incidence of postoperative UTI's increase significantly in patients with positive prostate-cultures.	3.9073835015247984
On the other hand we only found corresponding prostate- and postoperative urine-cultures in less than 50%.	3.2778368442770645
The presented data are not sufficient to conclude the kind of relevance of bacterial prostatic colonization for postoperative UTI's in transurethral prostatectomy.	3.2501612537319766
Apnea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care.	3.214400058372991
The prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment, however, are controversial.	3.7672004961939054
The universal aim, in order to prevent traumatization of the lung, is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible.	3.4713472962045118
Therefore drugs such as theophylline, aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal CPAP have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit.	3.062501435651648
In these studies we developed a treatment algorithm.	3.4786219048133358
In two clinically controlled studies performed successively we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline.	2.817004206576605
As aminophylline has more side effects, sodium acetate theophylline is preferable.	3.4857094998260094
Bradycardia, apnea and desaturation were registered from the print-out of the monitoring system's trend analysis and in a polysomnographic study during steady-state conditions.	3.4622644802551457
In a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration.	3.6578550222431288
We demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline; however, doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first 3 days of treatment.	3.5578819457319506
In a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal CPAP as the third level of treatment.	3.6440585534606895
The rate of bradycardia, apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during CPAP and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved.	3.05831323087307
Only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice (indication >=4 bradycardias below 80/min, 4 desaturations below 80% or 2 apneas of >=20 s over 2 h).	3.1545184612680175
After 48 h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe >=3 apneas, 15 bradycardias or 15 desaturations over this period.	2.8123626988223522
Nasal CPAP was introduced as the third line of treatment.	3.6575160861666274
With this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from 4.9 to 3.4 days (P<0.01).	3.146975159586182
An evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi-institutional studies is indicated.	3.0200273872845886
Background: Associations between back pain, the quality of sleep and the quality of matresses have not yet been investigated systematically.	4.367724952289037
Methods: At check-out we asked 265 consecutive guests of a trade fair hotel about the subjective quality of sleep in the previous night.	3.038015653033795
Nine rooms had been equipped with new mattresses of three different qualities and prices, but this was kept blind to the hotel staff and the guests.	3.2270871884346155
Sleep quality was assessed on an analog scale between 1 (very good) and 5 (very bad) and was analyzed in comparison to the remaining 8-year old mattresses of the hotel, but also with respect to social (e.g.	4.045999994961767
private vs. professional reason for the stay) as well as personal (e.g.	3.7375678560851076
previous experience with low back and sleep complaints) characteristics of the guests.	3.7506091850780465
Results: The three qualities of the mattresses correlated significantly and positively with the perceived quality of sleep, but the difference to the "old" mattresses was most pronounced for those guests who were staying overnight for professional reasons, or who frequently were suffering from low back pain or sleep disturbances.	3.113294681871617
Conclusion: At least for chronic sufferers from back pain and sleep problems, the association between sleep quality and quality of the mattress is significant.	3.786805976055617
Body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in-patient and out-patient settings, individually or in groups, alone or combined with other methods.	3.292546372637195
These methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are restricted in their emotions, or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character.	3.53801902646415
Short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays, reference is made to other procedures.	3.404219588913752
The connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter alia and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological consequences are mentioned as active factors.	3.237731768743125
In later development, the body and certain parts of the body acquire a symbolical meaning too, which is important for the therapy.	4.324663430231316
The relationship of body oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy and especially to psychoanalysis shall also be discussed.	2.964754847790721
Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases that occur in relation to cancer.	3.8596858717656484
Supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune mechanism, specific antineuronal antibodies have sometimes been detected.	3.4367875573646764
The current possibilities for treatment are limited.	3.4456601528198396
A female patient, aged 57, suffering from a breast cancer, developed a severe paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and limbic encephalitis within a few weeks.	3.716937795630538
It is possible that the impressive partial remission that occurred during the ensuing 6 months was not due to therapy.	3.0705170420171375
Although the patient was still bound to a wheelchair, discharge from hospital was possible because she was still able to perform daily tasks by herself.	3.3143070695909995
A recurrence of the cerebellar symptoms with mild alterations of mental status occurred 2 months later but again showed a good remission.	3.3116140973733708
The outcome in 163 patients treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the department for vascular and thoracic surgery since its institution 5 years ago is investigated.	3.3740637145366357
Some 142 patients underwent operative aneurysm repair; 21 (13%) were excluded from operation.	3.3679949897874857
In 108 (66%) an elective procedure was performed, an emergency operation for rupture 34 times (21%).	3.4520398247198756
In 16% of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted.	3.11826066775176
For further analysis the patients were split in three groups: elective group 1, symptomatic group 2, ruptured group 3.	3.7827731922336096
Significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter, distribution of gender (128 M, 14 F), renal artery involvement, or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and the presence of multiple risk factors.	3.880948053065378
Group 1 had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2; whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group 3 than in the other two groups.	3.715686494832374
Sixty-four percent of patients had no, 11% had more than one complication.	3.662282164603632
Mortality was 0 in groups 1 and 2, but 35.3% in group 3.	3.406413278174259
The most frequent complication in groups 1 and 2 was pneumonia (13.9%) followed by cardiac complications (4.6%), and renal insufficiency (3.7%).	3.4587491806262465
In group 3 respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence (23.5%), followed by renal insufficiency (21%) and pneumonia (17.6%).	3.4818232207993787
No patient of the nonoperated group suffered an aneurysm rupture; aneurysm diameters, except one, did not increase during the follow-up period.	3.0741543236527407
Of the 130 operated and discharged patients 31 died; in no case was death related to the operative procedure.	3.3352610820702755
No important complications were observed during the follow-up of 37.2 +/- 17.9 months.	3.8318075597263093
Furthermore, the results are compared with those of the literature.	3.913375376101886
Based on their observations the authors conclude that this retrospective quality check was rather awkward and involved giving partly incomplete data for lack of a prospective evaluation.	3.0420238736842804
Nevertheless, the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory.	4.36850425253119
We report on a 32-year-old male patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who had severe candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract.	2.861478581087846
Treatment with fluconazole, 200 mg/day, was introduced.	3.2846299027790704
After oral intake of fluconazole over 5 months itraconazole 200 mg/day was given for 1 month.	3.4035323061307388
However, fungal infection still persisted.	3.1061331830979415
The antifungal activity of fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole against Candida albicans was evaluated by means of the microdilution test by determining the 90% inhibitory concentrations of each drugs.	3.306991362997649
A high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was detected for fluconazole (50 µg/ml) revealing fluconazole resistance.	3.128997631386795
The susceptibility to itraconazole was borderline (MIC 0.125 µg/ml) and that to ketoconazole was markedly lowered (MIC 0.25 µg/ml).	3.033132943684873
Plasma levels of itraconazole were also found to be lowered.	4.493378877176507
Therefore, the clinical resistance of Candida albicans to itraconazole can be explained by reduced susceptibility after azole therapy and also by the decreased absorption of the drug in HIV patients.	3.5561397574358344
Patients suffering from soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may sometimes require vascular reconstruction to remove the tumor with adequate margins of clearance.	3.326792560528616
Besides this, recurrent lymph node metastases are often affixed to neighboring vessels.	3.3087886755435902
MRI and angiography represent the adequate diagnostic procedures.	3.55747971478718
If there is doubt about invasion of arteries and veins, the vessels should be resected and replaced by autologous vein graft.	3.025635396350812
Soft tissue coverage is of major importance, particularly if prosthetic grafts are used or the resection is within an area of irradiated tissue.	3.2711127803036177
After radical resection and combined modality therapy, one can expect local recurrence rates similar to those without vessel invasion.	3.3545939870075494
To achieve this goal, surgical oncologists, vascular surgeons and plastic surgeons must work together.	2.952894442702377
Today, amputation can hardly be justified even in vessel-invasive soft tissue tumors.	3.1549055441673968
The study aimed to evaluate whether superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) is a useful tool in intensive care medicine to ventilate patients with pulmonary insufficiency.	3.8260600260518367
Surgery on the lacrimal system in 296 children was performed at the Münster University Eye Hospital from 1987 to 1992.	3.3351149441262025
The dermatology clinic in Krefeld has treated a wide range of patients since its founding in 1845.	3.1566492406019133
Background: Dapiprazole hydrochloride is an alpha-1-adrenergic inhibitor that anticipates the mydriatic effect of phenylephrine in dilator muscle receptors in a competitive way.	2.806256073429498
The aim of this study was to determine for which indications for mydriasis pupil dilation by phenylephrine alone is sufficient and if the reversal by dapiprazole is convenient and the practical.	2.5258292935345485
The Quality Assurance programmes of the social security insurance authorities are presented from the point of view of psychosomatic rehabilitation.	3.809177415212106
This presentation attempts to introduce aspects of both Quality Assurance and Quality Management into the field of medical rehabilitation.	3.0803841001093635
The consequences of the programme for political order are emphasized.	3.0869175897472365
The special features of the individual programme objectives are elaborated.	4.280392348937192
In addition, the importance of each of these objectives for psychosomatic rehabilitation is examined.	3.2791237430806435
This field will inevitably have to adopt concepts of time and resource optimization.	3.179926450828551
Most of the published systems have been created by a panel of experts, giving to each dysfunction a number of points, usually 1 to 4, according to the severity.	3.95674426548151
Only 2 systems are different: the MODS of Marshall et al.	2.7379759549938276
and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction LOD system of Le Gall et al., both published recently (1995 and 1996).	3.0938983770970108
They differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review (MDOS) or from a logistic regression (LOD), and secondly, because neither takes into account the therapy.	3.3043774091681333
Besides, the LOD system, when used on the 1st ICU day, has statistical qualities which are very promising.	3.297526294387513
The relationsship between the growth of tumors and the expression of the protooncogen Bcl-2 could be shown in epithelial tumors.	3.8852030519460423
A bcl-2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis.	3.7685710905763945
The potential meaning of bcl-2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown.	2.695003126222289
The fact, that the heterogenous group of osteosarkoma is not sufficiently characterized at present, suggested to investigate the bcl-2 expression in osteosarcoma.	3.3721913202091107
Thus, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 47 specimens of different osteosarcomas of 36 patients.	3.5909380675417646
Sixteen cases (46 %) showed a strong expression of bcl-2 and 13 cases (35 %) were moderately positiv for bcl-2.	3.5645255348342246
Seven cases (19 %) were negative for bcl-2.	3.3578485186410942
The heterogenous, negative up to strong expression of bcl-2 yield clues, that the Bcl-2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics.	3.2623096823221642
Additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the monoklonal antibody MIB 1, directed against the Ki-67 epitop.	3.0121489043728125
The data of bcl-2 expression and cellular proliferationrate lead to a classification correlating with the histological classification.	3.5382244547024606
To verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether Bcl-2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma, further investigations will be needed.	3.7669545150803243
During a period of two weeks in hot dry midsummer 3 patients presented in our pediatric outpatient clinic after a bath in a small lake.	3.2568602917065927
They had an extremely itching, elevated exanthema mainly on their legs.	3.1112169980372566
The single efflorescence had a diameter of about 1-3 cm.	3.653873087337772
There were no signs of infection or fever.	3.1444365281416293
Intussusception of the appendix vermiformis in adults is an uncommon event.	3.9680358933919617
The combination of a mucinous cystadenoma with an intussuscepted appendix is extremely rare.	2.871897807300896
Clinical symptoms are nonspecific; in most cases the correct diagnosis is not made before surgical exploration.	3.8276831357819434
Endoscopic appendectomy or disinvagination by enema have been described.	2.9126041977080894
Thus the definitive therapy is surgery and depends on the histological diagnosis.	3.7786292149782463
This observation was often made in the DRÄGER ISO 8 circle system with the gas inlet upstream of the soda lime canister with the gas-flow from bottom to top.	2.9853805693697057
Abstract:  MR-imaging of the spinal column using Turbo-Spin-Echo-Sequences (TSE) often shows flow-void structures resembling intraspinal vessels.	2.857700585204994
Due to misinterpretation of those phenomenons invasive diagnostic procedures may be performed to diagnose an arteriovenous malformation (myelography, spinal angiography).	3.1722861829209292
Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of spiral CT versus conventional CT in the preoperative assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies.	3.679763849496494
Surgery is still the primary therapeutic approach in treatment of tumors in the head and neck area, dating back to the early nineteenth century.	3.8106344066403794
More than 150 years ago, hemimaxillectomies and mandibular resections as well as hemiglossectomies were already performed by leading surgeons.	3.5123763742701892
The block principle we are now following dates back to Crile, who also established the principle of cervical lymph node dissection.	3.610080181545924
Ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery, rendering radical surgical interventions possible without disfiguring patients.	3.008954942482634
The development of facial reconstructive surgery proceeded in stages, in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps.	3.594852365442881
The change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via arterialized skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer.	3.411831555258307
Free bone grafting, inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting, has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites.	3.549946095679228
Although the five-year-survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past 30 years, distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded.	3.972668863380373
This is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques.	3.4661480966460796
The DÖSAK has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery.	2.972370588552355
Surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections.	2.893491606449269
For this reason, midfacial degloving offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors, especially from an aesthetic point of view.	2.7844028599061468
Tumors situated deep behind the viscerocranium at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a transmandibular, transmaxillar, or transfacial approach with minimal morbidity.	2.8918060053249253
Concerning the concept of neck dissection, radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure.	3.695941762255256
Actual inquiries concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in "No-neck" or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification.	3.1444295287570974
Laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years.	3.3766756874129054
Due to its physical properties, the CO2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and ablating tissue.	3.1377212430509904
The high absorption of its wavelength in water (=10600 nm) is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue.	3.000570505697662
Shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects, such as carbonization and coagulation.	4.04214287299979
This effect can be lessened with the SilkTouch scanner, since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating mirrors.	3.0932769188509623
Particularly well-suited for treatment hypertrophic scars, post-acne scarring, perioral and periorbital wrinkles, rhinophymas and benign neoplasms including verruca vulgaris.	2.774410392299177
Cosmetically favorable reepithelialization of the treated skin surfaces occurs within a very short time after treatment.	3.4060116501857323
Periorbital resurfacing and correction of a rhinophyma are used as examples of dermal treatment with the CO2 laser and the SilkTouch scanner.	3.7642873192894335
Acute spinal cord injury affects more than 3000 individuals per year with predominantly young people between 15 and 20 years of age being involved.	3.1949251773320104
Analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care.	3.8944562471003334
Therefore, there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed.	3.5533576721687052
The first hours after the accident are decisive, because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later.	3.7533392896777125
Besides the fate of the individual patient, the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care, long lasting rehabilitation, as well as post rehabilitative care.	4.379958319393689
Chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons, expecially in hippocampus, by which the degree of damage differs in various species.	3.227444081633228
Sapolski has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration, disturbed feed-back reaction, and hypersecretion of glucocorticoids.	3.138176428430937
The aim of this study was to investigate if the signal transmission via glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the brain of male wistar rats of two age groups (5-6 and 17-24 months, respectively) is changed in aging and which cytoplasmic factors/modulators participate in this process.	3.3161994363155407
Introduction: The treatment of soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle region remains a challenge, because special anatomical and physiological properties have to be considered.	3.563257407705413
Patients and methods: The data of 52 patients, who were treated between 1994 and 1998, were analyzed.	3.6467461533325425
48 % were posttraumatic defects and were located in the weight bearing zone in 37 %.	3.562564410978107
Results: Fifty-nine procedures were used, including skin transplantation in 16 patients, local flaps in 3 cases, regional flaps in 14 cases, and microvascular procedures in 17 cases.	3.6078944433301463
Amputation was required in 4 patients.	4.339134460040922
The overall success rate was 92 %.	2.9572027560916685
Complications occurred in 18 patients.	3.0656184612724298
Conclusions: Using these data and evaluation of the actual literature lead to the development of an algorithm for the treatment of defects in this area.	4.638764087259813
The modern armamentarium of plastic surgery offers the possible different treatment modalities.	3.179348284994395
The conventional multichannel electroencephalogram is quite inconvenient for long-term monitoring in the operating theatre or intensive care unit.	3.456631265993845
Recording of the EEG would be easier if a small number of channels was sufficient.	3.4022938935289964
Aiming at reduction of channels, leads from different regions of the scalp were analysed visually and with regard to their spectral content.	3.6742413431111807
APC resistance was first discovered in 1993.	3.779252535842515
It is the most frequent cause of thrombophilia in Europe and North America.	3.3368542709617888
In more than 90% of cases, the underlying cause of APC resistance is a single point mutation in the factor V gene.	3.767362606893518
Heterozygous patients have a between five- and ten-fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis, while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50- and 100-fold.	3.903296094186836
Where there is a previous history of thrombosis, a careful investigation of the coagulation system, in particular a determination of the APC ratio, is recommended prior to surgery.	4.264564420133597
In patients with APC resistance, a body-weight-specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended.	3.2807256423922913
Heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present, while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time.	2.9343103542116022
Primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications.	3.651454368057312
Pyomyositis is an acute bacterial infection with abscess formation in the skeletal muscles mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus.	3.411881264915965
The disease is found more often in males.	3.1023967775626726
Since the patients symptoms and the clinical and laboratory findings are relatively unspecific, the clinical diagnosis of pyomyositis can present difficulties.	4.531044767111217
Furthermore, cases of pyomyositis are rare in non-tropical countries and some physicians may not be familiar with it.	3.647925387831997
If not diagnosed and treated properly, pyomyositis can lead to sepsis and death.	3.408851978383269
Although the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been clarified, some predisposing factors of forensic interest are well known: (trivial) trauma or vigorous exercise of the affected skeletal muscles, small potentially "septic" foci in other tissues or internal organs and a preexisting immunodeficiency, e. g. in diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug abusers or individuals suffering from HIV.	3.4180171955629
Three cases of "non-tropical" pyomyositis with fatal outcome are presented and the literature on the subject is reviewed with special reference to epidemiological and etiological factors, taking forensic aspects, histomorphologic findings and the problems of post-mortem diagnosis of pyomyositis into consideration.	3.7912517668385277
Aim of the study: The etiology of persistent crying during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated.	3.0035479946797916
Based upon recent data from the "Munich Interdisciplinary Research and Intervention Program (MIRIP)", this paper shall discuss and challenge well known explanatory models.	2.98722991676884
In addition, novel approaches of intervention shall be presented.	2.7306560440122207
Because tumour cell invasion is a three-dimensional process involving tumour cells as well as stromal cells, tumour invasion models should include equivalents of both compartments in a spatially defined organisation.	3.6481690355090843
Material and methods: OSCC cell lines were established and cultured on collagen type I matrix with and without the inclusion of fibro-/myofibroblasts derived from nodular palmar fibromatosis).	2.838233165165889
Evaluation of invasion was done by conventional H & E staining after paraffin embedding; immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratins (MNF 116), involucrin (Sy5), vimentin (V9), collagen type IV (CIV22), laminin (1-chain, 4C7), and Ki-67 (MIB1); and electron microscopy followed.	3.168668756319966
Results: The OSCC cell lines PE/CA-PJ15, PE/CA-PJ34, PE/CA-PJ41 were invasive exclusively on gels containing fibroblasts with stratification of the multilayerd OSCC cell coat and polarised expression of cytokeratin and involucrin.	2.412071819019343
There was no evidence for BM, either by immunohistochemistry or by electron microscopy, although OSCC are immunohistochemically positive for collagen type IV and laminin in the 2D cell culture.	3.014642770812891
There were no differences in proliferative activity of the gels with and without fibroblasts.	3.1295169014619684
Conclusions: Carcinoma cell invasion depends on the presence of fibroblasts in the gel indicating the important role of tumor stromal fibro-/myofibroblasts during carcinomic invasion.	3.150049543815153
The absence of a BM does not, per se, imply an invasive tumour growth.	3.125005484869337
Moreover, stratification and terminanl differentiation of epithelial tumour cells occur independently of a structural BM.	2.912497248481388
Interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing.	3.898680267831561
Limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability.	3.6076450077342326
Although larger movements still promote callus formation, the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered.	3.8377815491109115
Fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large.	3.500806626551372
A combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non-union.	4.23215797188395
Therefore, having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach, one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis.	3.6801189828499266
Dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap, stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process.	3.4084957698263088
External mechanical stimulation, however, has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load-bearing patients.	4.067173008150298
Although ketamine has been in clinical use for 3 decades, the neuropharmacological basis of its analgesic, anaesthetic, sympathomimetic, and psychotomimetic effects is still a subject of controversial discussion and intensive investigational efforts.	3.360080929999794
In recent years, however, new experimental approaches to its effects on the cellular and molecular level and the availability of pure ketamine enantiomers contributed substantially to the understanding of its complex neuropharmacology.	3.480728981816769
This article reviews the current knowledge of ketamine effects on ligand-operated and voltage-operated transmembrane ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors, transmitter uptake, and the NO-cGMP system in neurons.	3.006839817879861
With regard to its potential clinical relevance and supposed relative role among the complex mechanisms involved in pain perception, analgesia, anaesthesia, and psychotomimesis, the contributions of recent experimental and clinical findings to the identification of major target sites of ketamine are summarised.	3.288794078792688
In contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the potential role of opioid receptors, there is now considerable evidence that NMDA antagonism is a central mechanism that contributes to the amnesic, analgesic, anaesthetic, and psychotomimetic as well as the neuroprotective actions of ketamine.	3.234046484470898
Moreover, the involvement of non-NMDA glutamate receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic transmission, interactions with 5-HT receptors, and L-Type Ca2+ channels may account for some of its anaesthetic and neuroprotective properties.	3.02750858317697
There is undoubtedly a need for a safe disinfection method of optical instruments used by ENT specialists.	3.4764612959459535
So far, a standard method that sufficiently covers the risk of infection for patients and medical staff alike while serving the need of practicability in daily routine has not been established.	3.6848943963812983
Therefore, in the ENT departments of the hospitals of Mannheim, Kaiserslautern, and Tübingen, studies on the disinfection of rigid optical instruments without working channel were performed between February 1999 and May 1999.	3.065616910449076
Instruments were wiped either with an aldehyde or alcohol (ethanol 80%) and germs were detected by quantitative swab cultures.	3.0736453595187063
As discussed in the article, disinfection with ethanol proved to be at least equally efficient if not better than disinfection with aldehyde.	3.2772720656514327
White piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals, caused by the widespread Trichosporon fungi.	4.130639660206748
The infection is characterized clinically by whitish, soft and easily removable coating of the hair shafts; however, the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points.	3.0754109816968604
While all body hair may be affected, the pubic hair is most frequently affected.	3.3751278104590834
This paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34-year-old Central European man.	3.1688503856824934
In all, 22 cases have been described world-wide in young men ranging in age from 20 to 40 years.	3.5218600307760446
Only 2 men, aged 42 and 53 years, do not fall in this range.	3.013414454064867
Recently, a major African study disclosed this disease in women for the first time.	3.078901301972419
In moderate latitudes, however, this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men.	3.689979693082052
In open fractures the rate of infected non-union defects has in recent years decreased due to the increased primary application of external fixation.	4.320412283937549
In spite of this positive state of affairs the condition is still encountered often enough to warrant specific treatment strategies and techniques.	2.8208839520375917
This includes radical excision of infected pseudarthrotic bone and of the diseased surrounding soft tissue, provides mechanical stability in the non-union area and requires effective local treatment of the infection in combination with systemic, target-specific and temporary well-defined antibiotic therapy as well as procedures to improve local circulation.	4.131775470301516
The incorporation of autogenous bone transplants in defects appears to depend on close contact between the transplant and the vascularized receiving site and on the quantity of the transplanted osseous material.	3.27990008117837
A promising alternative method of dealing with extensive bone defects is osteogenesis produced by callus distraction; therefore special attention is given to Ilizarov's ring fixation system.	3.014079443895231
Unstable scar formation demands local muscular flaps or microvascularized free flap transfer, which seems to be superior to other methods.	3.782631089324431
Aim of the study: Using phantom studies, a dedicated low-field MR system with 0.2 T and a whole-body MR-scanner with 1.0 T were compared.	3.129834991193561
Many different mechanisms contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the so-called diabetic foot syndrome.	3.5897296141688395
Among chronic complications, the diabetic foot syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization.	3.3198629414694345
The relative risk of diabetic patients requiring an amputation is up to 45 times greater than in normal subjects.	2.994000006089632
Sensory neuropathy, ischemia, and infection are the principal pathogenetic factors in the diabetic foot syndrome.	3.2181299386540156
In most cases, a painless trauma is the initial condition that leads to an ulcer.	3.1715713753189956
In this article, an overview of the different causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment options for a multidisciplinary team are discussed.	3.4930788410363443
Lung resection offers the best prospect of long-term survival in patients with nonmetastatic pulmonary neoplasia.	3.907310070844297
In view of the dismal prognosis of unresected bronchial cancer, surgical resection should be encouraged even in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function.	3.6646404829657993
Accurate estimation of the postoperative cardiopulmonary function is therefore desirable to avoid (a) refusal of potentially curative treatment and (b) severe postoperative disability.	3.414065381208515
The origins of postresection morbidity and mortality are multifactorial.	3.608352968490121
Thus, no single pulmonary function test or hemodynamic measurement can accurately and reliably predict postoperative cardiorespiratory complications.	2.8628452443655266
Criteria of functional operability should be based on percent of predicted value, so that patient's age, sex, and height will be taken into consideration.	3.2197953221087405
Exercise testing offers the advantage that both pulmonary and cardiac risk can be evaluated simultaneously.	3.3527060343960673
The calculation of predicted postoperative lung function (ppo) is of importance.	3.2462487087793614
The postoperative values for the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1-ppo), the transfer factor (TL,CO-ppo), and VO2max-ppo can be predicted by using the same formula.	3.5953115460509455
Patients with nearly normal lung function (FEV1, TL,CO > 75 % predicted) and no concomitant cardiac disease can undergo lung resection right up to pneumonectomy without further diagnostic procedures.	3.058618755572242
In the others, FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo should be estimated first by taking into account the number of segments to be resected.	3.1092458013288646
Patients with values < 30 % predicted are usually regarded as being inoperable, whereas values > 40 % predicted qualify for resection without the need for further diagnostics.	3.090425209727522
VO2max < 10 ml/kg/min or < 40 % predicted are prohibitive for surgery.	3.1449809208311623
If VO2max is > 20 ml/kg/min or > 75 % predicted, functional operability without limitation is given.	3.072860365613702
For those cases where diagnostic uncertainty still remains, FEV1-ppo, TL,CO-ppo, and VO2max-ppo can be calculated by means of quantitative lung scans.	2.974069589432077
The treatment of acute of Achilles tendon rupture experienced a dynamic development in the last ten years.	3.129962928773316
Decisive for this development was the application of MRI and above all the ultrasonography in the diagnostics of the pathological changes and injuries of tendons.	3.938581862486832
The question of ruptue morphology as well as different courses of healing could be now evaluated objectively.	3.0922590976795696
These advances led consequently to new modalities in treatment concepts and rehabilitation protocols.	3.1405760940152168
The decisive input for improvements of the outcome results and particularly the shortening of the rehabilitation period came with introduction of the early functional treatment in contrast to immobilizing plaster treatment.	3.6914890525055215
In a prospective randomized study (1987-1989) at the Trauma Dept.	3.2300854746986167
The crucial criteria for therapy selection results from the sonografically measured position of the tendon stumps in plantar flexion (20  °).	3.618682326442479
Regarding the current therapeutic standards each method has is advantages and disadvantages.	3.3011891605778647
Both, the operative and non-operative functional treatment enable a stable tendon healing with a low risk of rerupture (1-2 %).	4.092851614946237
Meanwhile there is consensus for early functional aftertreatment of the operated Achilles' tendons.	3.0484724015616687
There seems to be a trend towards non-operative functional treatment in cases of adaquate sonografical findings, or to minimal invasive surgical techniques.	3.9319380556652797
Based on a case report, we offer brief guidelines on the perioperative management of patients with Sleep-Apnea-Syndrome (SAS) who present with a high incidence of a difficult airway and a high risk of respiratory depression during the perioperative period.	3.935729436445492
A 39 year old male patient with a body mass index of 34,22 kg/m2 and receiving continuous-positive-airway-pressure- (CPAP) therapy for known SAS was scheduled for elective plastic surgery.	3.316972132268588
After induction of anaesthesia and direct laryngoscopy no adequate airway could be established and the patient became hypoxic, hypercapnic and developed hypotension and bradycardia.	3.361044645321852
With the use of a laryngeal mask airway the patient was stabilized and did not show neurologic sequale after immediate awakening.	4.074955540308478
The following fiberoptic intubation of the awake patient, still showing tendency of upper airway obstruction, confirmed the difficult anatomical structures.	3.1131027712165356
The subsequent general anesthesia was uneventful.	3.4052690173586657
The patient received CPAP therapy and was monitored during the first postoperative night in the Intensive Care Unit.	3.276353613541724
He made an uneventful recovery.	3.439695994369368
He was advised to have regional anaesthesia or planned fiberoptic intubation, where possible, in the case of further anesthetic intervention.	3.4979783025000835
SAS has major implications for the anaesthesiologist and whenever patients exhibiting the high risk factors (obesity, male sex, history of intense snoring, impaired daytime performance, nonrefreshing daytime naps) are presented for surgery this condition should be considered.	3.333341370367863
Elective surgery should be postponed until after adequate examination and treatment when necessary.	3.672609196845906
Patients with SAS should always be suspected of having cardiopulmonary dysfunctions such as hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia or cor pulmonale.	2.892112636181517
It is most important to avoid sedative premedication, to initiate CPAP therapy preoperatively, to encourage regional anaesthesia if possible and to ensure close monitoring over the complete perioperative period.	3.020403677726582
Planned fiberoptic intubation, preferably with surgical personnel available for an emergency airway, is a safe method for the induction of anaesthesia.	3.991949561145787
Postoperatively, patients are at high risk from respiratory depression, even in the awake state.	4.598259974104582
Independently of regional or general anaesthesia there is an increased risk of respiratory depression in the middle of the first postoperative week, suspected to be caused by the catching up on lost REM-sleep, due to shifts in the normal sleep pattern during the first postoperative days.	4.2520187873271285
Life style measures (weight reduction and control, reduction of total fat calories to <30% of total calories, modification of fat intake to increased monounsaturated vegetable fat, increased intake of dietary fibers, increased physical activity, controlled stress relaxation) are the basis of longterm therapy of coronary heart disease.	3.3309377097011006
For transformation to daily life both patient and doctor need motivation, information, patience, and realistic aimes.	3.060970692332276
For realization the 10 rules of medical information should be followed.	3.5981677305110806
The patient must be informed that the "new lifestyle" is not punishing but means a new quality of life.	2.781096245970479
With respect to the most important metabolic syndrome with hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance, weight reduction is the most important measure for preventing complications of atherosclerosis.	3.7315102083541736
The patient should use a diary for weight control and blood pressure selfmeasurement.	3.2033880388786407
IOL implantation in childhood is still controversial.	3.802061868028293
Background: Increases in serum calcium are often detected by chance.	3.2332100760487053
They warrant a prompt diagnostic work-up to identify the underlying cause.	4.283679252328824
In the present review we describe our experience with debridement in necrotizing pancreatitis, with particular emphasis on the indications for surgery and the outcome in patients with infected and sterile necrosis.	4.069987353271894
Within 7 years 64 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis underwent surgery with a median preoperative APACHE II score of 9.	3.5671286275661207
The indications for surgery were either proven infection or persistence of symptoms.	3.2273181893942895
Thirty-six patients were found to have infected necrosis, while 28 patients had sterile necrosis.	3.295914371066227
There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding pre- and postoperative parameters.	2.744396525644983
The surgical technique involved a blunt necrosectomy followed by closed packing with Penrose drains.	2.663192924541764
This technique produced the lowest reported mortality of 6.2 % with a reoperation rate of only 17 %, demonstrating that even with sterile necrosis surgical management can be carried out safely.	3.217716477864149
The incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) is proportional to the incidence of myocardial ischaemic episodes.	3.2591476517038513
Therefore, the prevention of such episodes is of great clinical importance.	3.659042262028289
The absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid is a major problem in transurethral prostatic surgery (TUR-P).	3.282304322299971
Various indicators have been tested to monitor fluid absorption with regard to continuous registration and sufficient accuracy.	3.587792465025164
The volumetric fluid balance is not suitable as a routine method because of its inaccuracy.	3.8223400349529135
Easily accessible parameters are unspecific because of surgical bleeding (haematocrit [Hct]), or are interfered with by physiological counter-regulatory actions (serum sodium [Na] concentration).	2.813550680550195
In 1986 Hulten et al.	2.7607708077904403
In a prospective clinical study of 17 patients undergoing TUR-P under spinal anaesthesia, expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid (2% ethanol in Purisole, Fresenius, Bad Homburg) were monitored.	3.0598827871165026
Gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified diverting anaesthetic gas monitor (Normac, Datex, Helsinki) that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use.	3.289944386306082
In addition, at intervals of 10 minutes we measured blood alcohol, endtidal alcohol (Alcotest 7110, Drauml;ger, Lübeck), haematocrit, serum Na concentration, and blood gases.	2.9095463943728164
Sixty-eight measurements were obtained from the 17 patients.	3.529408871623337
As shown in other studies, serum Na (r2 = 0.68) and Hct (r2 = 0.39) correlated poorly with the irrigation fluid as determined by serum alcohol levels.	3.065568692423118
In contrast, the expiratory alcohol measurements with the alcotest 7110 (r2 = 0.93) and Normac devices (r2 = 0.85) were closely related.	2.6559417992078864
Continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a Normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentrations, and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during TUR-P.	3.1345387390028754
Between 1986 and 1996, 21 patients had a tibiocalcanear arthrodesis.	3.8230449572427947
Indications for surgery were in all cases either osteomyelitis or avascular necrosis of the talus.	3.566778981971958
External stabilisation was used in 17 patients due to severe soft tissue damage or extensive infection of the talus, internal screw fixation was used in four patients.	4.620372281282231
There were eight complications in seven patients, one patient had a below the knee amputation.	3.698801430760302
The leg length discrepancies after resection of the talus was equalised in four cases with callus distraction using an Ilisarov ring fixator.	4.110805432454115
Follow up evaluation was available in 18 patients after an average of 38 months (12-86 mo.).	3.4412257676916425
There were no infectious recurrenies during the follow up period and a solid fusion was achieved in all patients that were followed.	4.187549394100056
According to a modified Kitaoka score, results were excellent and good in 12 of the 18patients.	3.748190369067827
External stabilisation, especially the Ilisarov ring fixator is the primary method of treatment in cases with severe infection or soft tissue damage.	4.48599468102687
Intraoperative autotransfusion (MAT), preoperative autologous blood donation, and preoperative normovolaemic haemodilution are three different methods to avoid homologous blood transfusion during surgical procedures.	2.9887204576124873
The controversial use of MAT via cell saver in tumour surgery as well as contamination of the operative field with urine illustrate the particular difficulties of autologous blood transfusion in connection with radical prostatectomy.	3.6923038625067766
We investigated changes in the osmotic resistance of the retransfused red blood cells (RBC), bacterial contamination, changes in coagulation parameters, and the presence of tumour cells.	3.932773309676697
Orbital pseudotumor is a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology that can be divided histopathologically into three basic types: granulomatous, lymphoid, and sclerosing.	3.8221202509536694
Histopathological examination showed granulomatous type of pseudotumor in six, lymphoid in three, and sclerosing in three patients.	3.351400638670553
In seven cases the pseudotumor orbitae were medially located and in four cases laterally.	2.7781078929268435
In one patient nearly all orbital structures were infiltrated.	2.8644072493509944
A number of different mapping systems have been published for the lymph-node staging in lung cancer.	3.6599762194712837
The use of a reproducible map is an essential prerequisite for correct determination of the TNM status and comparing the surgical results.	3.662718416921
Responses were obtained from 61 (67.7 %) hospitals.	3.4880057096628647
Currently, the majority of the departments (43 %) use the German staging system (according to the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Thorax-, Herz- und Gefäßchirurgie/Pneumologie), 23 % lymph-node mapping according to Naruke, and 25 % an individual description of the resected lymph nodes.	3.496398496783537
The number of resected lymph nodes is reported in 75 % of the departments, the quotient of involved/not involved lymph nodes in 33 %.	3.9134000679132375
Mediastinal lymph-node sampling guided by the intraoperative aspect of lymph nodes is performed in 59 % of the departments.	4.275788734371153
A systematic mediastinal "en-bloc" resection is accomplished in 41 %.	3.1119143830380276
The results of this survey represent the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymphadenectomy in lung cancer in Germany and might be useful for the development of a uniform staging system.	3.6886728652460166
In another case pneumonectomy was performed for left-sided lung cancer with concomitant empyema as an emergency procedure in a patient referred from an outside hospital.	3.6275426601940644
Empyema was treated with repeated thoracoscopic debridements and intermittent lavage with polyvinylpyrrolidine-iodine solution and streptocinase/streptodornase.	3.0997503785165024
Three to seven thoracoscopies were required to sterilize the pleural cavity.	3.0001319207124997
After a median follow-up of 14 months all three patients are well and without any evidence of infection.	3.4228017189311752
VATS is suitable for definitive treatment of postpneumonectomy empyema and is associated with excellent functional and cosmetic results.	3.6386387981909665
Injuries to the spine and the spinal cord are an important problem.	3.9636282778900447
In the present paper the application of external transpedicular fixation of the spinal column for surgical treatment of patients in the acute phase of spinal cord injuries is described.	4.468640923203231
The results of treatment obtained in 54 patients in the acute phase are presented.	3.371231849636224
Decompression of the spinal cord can be accomplished by way of a dorsal approach.	3.7817947900392266
In this way it is possible to remove the compressing factor in stages.	3.6053832766606786
Positive results were achieved in the late phase in 84.22% of patients with acute spinal and spinal cord injuries.	4.41031824289534
Objectives: Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) show retarded growth.	2.898856741667454
The question arose as to whether proportionate catch-up growth follows.	3.0992560697254223
Background: The fundus autofluorescence imaging technique has been modified allowing improved image resolution (768 x 572 pixel).	2.7511292150274187
We present results of fundus autofluorescence studies using this technique.	2.9399040833738974
Certain intra-articular fractures of the knee can be managed by arthroscopically assisted reduction and  fixation.	3.6628581160032483
The known benefits of arthroscopy include better visualization of the entire joint, limited dissection, and thorough irrigation.	3.3881719338453204
From May 1995 to November 1997, 34 patients with intra-articular fractures of the knee were treated by arthroscopic reduction and fixation.	3.711400011607863
We treated 11 patients with tibial plateau fracture type I, II and III (according to J. Schatzker classification), 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (intercondylar eminence) type II, III and IV (according to Meyers, McKeever and Zariczny classification), two patients with completely dislocated osteochondral flake fractures of the femoral condyle, and one patient with a minimally displaced fracture of the patella.	3.7053742005961503
Postoperatively they were all allowed passive motion exercises.	3.149591818594227
Patients with avulsion fractures of the ACL and the patient with fracture of the patella were allowed immediate weight bearing, while patients with tibial plateau fractures and osteochondral fractures were allowed weight bearing only after 12 weeks.	3.943841124267017
Results: Of the 11 tibial plateau fractures, 8 were anatomically reduced, and in 2 the dislocation was less than 2 mm.	3.830967443087048
No further dislocation of the fragment followed.	3.9990983860410014
All patients but one reported stable knees and they all had a full range of motion at follow-up.	3.19274516281361
Of the 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament, 19 were anatomically reduced.	3.5136847032621263
Except in one patient, functional results were excellent (KT1000 was 1.3 mm, average loss of flexion was 2.5 °, loss of extension was 1.3 °).	3.3961417988967546
In two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle, reduction was anatomical.	3.807008277850474
The fractures healed, the patients were free of pain and had full ROM at the follow-up.	3.559559843129186
There was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications.	3.380573969203572
Conclusions: Arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra-articular fractures of the knee.	3.4621642595581257
Provided indications are good, results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy.	3.5864413352866222
Some technical hints are presented.	3.301446465431546
A healthy 38-year-old woman suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days after a vaginal hysterectomy.	3.4789008091168165
Although standard cardiac life support (CPR) was instituted immediately after the event, it was not possible to re-establish a spontaneous circulation for about 40 min.	3.531219211430874
Systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with slow injection of 1.5 million IU urokinase was performed as a final life-maintaining measure because of the high probability that the underlying cause was a pulmonary embolus; 10 min later (after 60 min of ongoing CPR) the patient regained a stable circulation.	3.633545408268282
She survived without neurological deficit in spite of the long duration of CPR.	4.001010654150662
In 348 patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between 1985 and 1994 we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection, its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging.	4.876317960878654
The same histopathological work-up was carried out in all cases.	3.8725418183943243
Whether resections or extirpations were performed, the number of dissected lymph nodes increased from 5.3 and (1985/1986) to 16.7 and 17.3 (1991/1992) and to 15.8 and 17.3 (1993/1994) respectively.	3.328944234331406
Neither the type of operation nor the surgeon's experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected.	3.5825342059869265
The increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation, the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk.	4.157224682790645
We found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases (P = 0.02) and between an increase in UICC stage III (P = 0.005) and pN2 tumors (P = 0.000) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected.	3.875232561542225
Central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases.	4.44332688610089
With the institution of the Protection against infection Act, case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of notifiable infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in Germany for the first time.	2.7106182349223493
Case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease.	3.5741526654655567
The abstraction thereby required leads to the creation of nosological entities.	3.2114932905993196
The case definitions, which were developed by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to the Protection against infection Act, enable the local health departments to assess and categorise reported cases, deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the RKI via the state health institutions.The quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved, as each reported case/infection will fulfil defined criteria, thereby enabling unclear cases/diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed.	2.9267002328752816
Endosseous osseointegrated implants have become an integral part of the treatment scheme for the prosthetic reconstruction and rehabilitation of masticatory function following scientific studies of the reactions between implant and soft and hard tissues.	3.730359167682668
Furthermore, implants offer good chances for prosthetic rehabilitation in the insufficient bone site, if the extremely atrophic jaw is to be reconstructed by grafting procedures with avascular and vascular grafts, by guided bone regeneration, by distraction osteogenesis, by bone substitutes and in the future by osteoinductive proteins in order to prepare the conditions for implant insertion.	3.6132147402357044
Those reconstruction procedures combined with implants become often necessary, if  complicated hard and soft tissue defects of the skull have to be reconstructed to create the prerequisites for the stabilisation of epitheses or to insert implant-supported devices.	3.6237971267849356
A 58-year-old woman was initially externally diagnosed in 1983 with a presacral mass, which was subsequently treated as an abcess.	3.346017049571151
Thereafter, the patient experienced recurrent perianal fistulas.	4.046872186602269
Histologically, cystic scar tissue was found with a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma which measured 4 cm.	3.3150282131279747
Later on, the patient again experienced perianal fistulas originating from a renewed presacral mass.	3.422817430146525
As a result, an abdominal-perianal rectum extirpation and a partial resection of the sacrum with placement of a descendostomy were done.	3.164037615202833
Histologically, adenocarcinoma tissue was found at the base of a tail-gut cyst.	3.2829126938118893
One year following her operation, the patient is free from any complaints and relapses.	3.912072581977091
The tail-gut cyst is a very rare entity which arises from the inadequate involution of the tail-gut during embryonal development.	3.023270863463306
In the case of recurrent perianal fistulas and cystic masses between the rectum and os sacrum or os coccygeum, a tail-gut cyst should be taken into consideration, the goal being its complete removal.	2.928993793510544
The German Social Law has required quality assurance (QA) procedures since 1989.	2.7614524377486527
The measures must be suitable to allow "comparing investigations".	3.2444801090386366
In 1992 the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine published recommendations for QA in anaesthesia: most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner, and thus, a list of 63 pitfalls, events, and complications (PECs) and five degrees of severity were defined.	3.199312900713798
The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of PECs in anaesthesia and to correlate PECs with procedures and preoperative health status.	3.0697842513139553
Using the diary method, the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed.	3.0864688661705655
Positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood.	2.972664208952852
Duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities.	3.254021827550337
A total of 55 elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least 50 days.	3.0543374215529533
The data were analyzed interindividually (using regression analyses) and intraindividually (using time series analyses).	2.8419929485979667
While positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter- and intraindividual perspective, there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective.	3.4709501074471567
Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.	4.803209725752709
Purpose: Regional hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.	3.568947888057725
The purpose of the project is the optimization of the therapy using non-invasive, three-dimensional imaging of tissue changes or of the temperature distribution during regional hyperthermia.	3.605387437917807
The purpose of the Transfusion Law, which came into force on 7 July 1998, is to ensure the supply with safe blood products, to reinforce the confidence in the blood transfusion system, and to support self sufficiency with blood and plasma.	3.0627530650666617
In order to reach this goal, the law regulates the essential reqirements for the adequate collection of blood and blood constituents, as well for safe usage of blood products.	3.4708519610612076
Moreover it lays down rules for look-back procedures, prescribes the collection of data on the epidemiology in donor populations, creates a legal basis for the advisory group 'Arbeitskreis Blut', and fosters the self sufficiency with blood and plasma by several prescriptions.	2.7697236645546384
In the last decades back pain has reached dramatic proportions in industrialized countries.	2.7632182886819034
Disorders of the back are nowadays the leading cause of direct and indirect health care costs.	2.6349667972842363
Accurate prevalence estimates are needed to serve as a basis for health care evaluations.	3.7718024764981712
A review of epidemiologic studies in the general population reveals that back pain has reached a prevalence of 40 % for current pain.	3.2689029524883124
7 to 18 % are "frequently", "often", "daily" or "constantly" affected.	3.4832133241020014
75 % of the adult population suffers from back pain during the last year.	3.755481014947359
80 to 90 % of the adult population in industrialized countries experience back pain ever.	3.8811311381393776
Gender specific differences are only present in severe, chronic forms which are more often experienced by women.	3.4802115460729657
Back pain has a prevalence maximum at 50 to 64 years.	3.2049320484131467
Older persons display lower prevalence estimates.	3.3178184484492776
The prevalence maximum in men is one decade earlier than in women.	3.085898900913946
There are several potential explanations for this prevalence pattern that are discussed in the article.	3.1033588568906123
Back pain can be classified by location, temporal characteristics, pain intensity and pain history.	3.354625219405576
Currently, for none of these dimensions generally accepted, uniformly employed and validated definitions are available.	3.018955161858415
In most of the industrialized countries back pain is one of the most expensive symptoms.	3.596009954918872
75-90 % of the direct and indirect health care costs were caused by those 5-10 % of patients who are disabled.	4.104429526157688
As predictors of back pain a history of back pain and job satisfaction play by far a more important role than the extensively studied mechanical factors.	3.3799123877529107
For a first episode of back pain the prognosis is favorable.	3.4792098517974313
If the pain persist for more than three months the prognosis is unfavorable.	3.851258962543069
After six months of absenteeism because of back pain more than half of the afflicted never return to work.	3.5486015740612014
Rarely back pain is present as a single symptom.	4.017952840571773
In more than 80 % back pain is associated with pain in at least one joint.	4.613853587159692
It remains to be studied if back pain may be viewed as an entity or as part of a more complex pain syndrome.	3.5831924109097906
Chronic low back pain can be considered to be one of the most frequently treated and most costly diseases in modern industrial societies.	3.7543732970804222
Dysfunctions and imbalances of the spine-supporting muscles increase the risk of low back pain.	3.6387317382856277
Consequently preventive treatment and rehabilitation have to aim at preserving and restoring the full capacity of the spine-supporting muscles as well as training coordination and spine-friendly behaviour.	3.313637758688478
In addition to various measures of pain therapy, physiotherapeutic treatment including neuro-physiotherapy, physical treatment (eg electrotherapy), balneotherapy and supportive behavioural training, medical rehabilitation therapy (MRT) ranks among the most effective ways of treating low back pain.	3.088429969320288
MRT applies guidelines and methods of exercise methodology within medically indicated programmes of preventive treatment and rehabilitation.	3.0196647789748834
Various objectives of MRT are outlined with special regard to the stages of MRT treatment, emphasizing positive adaptation of the neuro-muscular system in the course of rehabilitation.	3.429837694131223
Physicians are responsible for MRT diagnosis and control.	3.7160480802579263
Taking into account the base disorder and the progress of therapy physiotherapists and the physicians in charge determine MRT objectives and treatment strategies.	3.154408685224777
A 39-year-old female patient presented with an intense allergic reaction and shock after ingesting sunflower seeds and simultaneously acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).	2.789090806246124
Skin tests and CAP specific.	3.367563421225038
IgE demonstrated an IgE-mediated sensibilization to sunflower seeds.	3.2175082904792984
When sunflower seeds were eaten alone, only discrete paresthesias of the oral mucosa occurred.	3.241736251767944
Surprisingly, an oral challenge with ASA was well tolerated.	3.3819118112106796
The supplementary centribution of ASA to the allergic reaction was done-dependent.	3.212001907792584
The quantity of the allergen also modified the intensity of the symptoms.	3.4463101227044115
This surprising effect of ASA may be attributed to increased gastric resorption of the allergens.	3.2690655925195706
During the course of this reaction, eosinophil-cationic-protein was released.	3.089970976501413
Axillary lymph node dissection for node sampling is one of the most important staging procedures when mammary carcinoma is treated surgically.	3.6356007746397636
Periprosthetic femoral fractures present the problem of fracture treatment and prosthetic stability.	3.744000945172338
Various treatment options are recommended for managing these fractures.	3.7449255388225824
We treated 51 patients with 54 periprosthetic fractures between 1985 and 1995.	3.055125257516773
Of these, 42 (78 %) fractures were treated with a plate, eight (14 %), with a revision prosthesis, two (4 %), with retrograde nailing, and two (4 %), conservatively due to poor medical condition.	3.8220262101316824
The choice of fracture management was dependent on the type and location of the fracture and on the stability of the prosthesis.	4.245163536592835
A total of 50 fractures healed primarily.	3.1919099303834657
Complications included three cases of plate loosening, one further fracture, one deep infection, one broken bolt and one varus deformity.	3.216856882726628
Four patients died in the postoperative period, an additional 19 were dead at the time of the evaluation.	3.744167581323278
Fractures with a stable implant can be treated with plate fixation.	3.916705997128543
Cases of a loose implant require revision.	3.173683327269116
Distal fractures are stabilized with a plate or with a retrograde nail.	3.5341538160294044
A young patient who underwent renewed aortic valve replacement after already open blasting of the aortic valve and following valve replacement with enlargement of the ascending thoracic aorty by using a pericardium patch had taken place is reported.	3.3659871212978665
In the area of this enlargement by the pericardium patch, the development of an aneurysm was seen and was resected in the same setting without any difficulties.	3.9985744901424773
The particular items with special regard to the postoperative course are delineated in the following report.	4.062778869182102
The situation of oncological surgery in Germany was evaluated by sending a questionnaire in January 1998 to 1979 registered surgical clinics.	3.2734897142659976
A total of 938 responded and stated that they are involved in that field.	3.2531908738758233
In 72 % of the departments oncological surgery adds up to 10-30 % of their overall work.	3.7466961046501446
The proportion of oncological surgery correlated to hospital size and is highest in university clinics.	3.097934315547977
Colorectal surgery is 93 % and is the leading topographical field in oncological surgery.	3.69823967466124
73 % of the hospitals regularly perform gastric tumor surgery.	3.798099943695691
The proportion of hospitals with breast surgery is surprisingly high (45 %).	2.986411418255348
Many hospitals (54.6 %) report neoadjuvant treatment regimens.	3.0968631165649607
Together with adjuvant therapy this rate amounts to 85.2 %.	2.966447015349461
The diagnostic spectrum of the hospitals involved in the inquiry is statisfactory.	3.7747450449755156
However, the modern possibilities of network and telecommunication are not sufficiently used.	2.9203000852242367
A second opinion is required predominantly in their own department or clinic, but not between centers.	3.644444244946103
Cryosurgery is a widely accepted modality for the treatment of capillary hemangiomas of the newborn.	4.192980534507691
However, no studies clearly supporting its effectivity are available.	2.8429122327339207
A considerable number of patients with cardiovascular diseases suffer from advanced heart failure.	3.0197506147872244
Actuarial 6-12 month survival of such patients is reduced to 50-75%.	3.8904046859580914
Since introduction of triple immunosuppression including cyclosporine, azathioprine and corticosteroids heart transplantation has been established as treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment.	3.500006902345401
However, the increasing imbalance between demand and supply of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients for this therapeutic option and requires a more restrictive listing of patients for heart transplantation.	3.4985507226360752
During the last few years promising new conservativ and alternativ surgical therapies have been developed.	2.845657174488991
The conservativ medical therapy was improved by application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive betablockers.	3.110217372240148
Alternativ surgical therapies of advanced heart failure include high risk bypass surgery, high risk valve surgery, mechanical assist devices, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, partial left ventriculectomy, cardiomyoplasty and multisite-pacing.	2.976499901833003
The therapeutic success is determined by adequate selection of patients for the respective therapy.	3.7358785295889088
This requires the implementation of risk scores on the basis of national and international registries of patients with advanced heart failure.	3.792169262164896
Motion analysis of the cervical spine is a sensitive tool in the fields of preventive and clinical biomechanics of whiplash.	3.976314740587962
In the field of preventive biomechanics motion analysis contributes to validation and optimisation of dummy based crash test experiments and simulations.	2.5974426040062197
In the clinical field motion analysis up to now is of restricted value.	3.24662954020026
Data exist about restrictions and pathologies of movement and motion of the cervical spine, coordinative disturbances, postural control, TMJ-function and oculomotor disturbances after whiplash.	2.955050421808967
The standardisation of technical and clinical set-ups is necessary to establish a well proven biomechnical model of whiplash and whiplash related biomechanical dysfunction.	3.5136904798699584
Without this model the value of motion analysis for clinical use will be restricted due to lack of comparable data on sensitivity and specificity although motion analysis of the cervical spine is neither cost- nor time consuming and free of adverse effects.	3.5831718586333254
Within a prospective series of 28 patients (14 m/ 14 f) with a follow-up to six weeks we were lucky to describe numerically two different types of reaction to low energy (v < 20 km/h) rear end collision: Type I with disturbances in complex movements only, Type II with overall restriction of movement.	3.3379933149128314
Control of angular velocity during cyclic movements of the head was disturbed by oscillations of higher frequency in all patients.	3.304794570180403
Recovery from whiplash within 6 weeks could be monitored.	3.4101388014209357
Diagnosis of parasomnias in the sleep laboratory is difficult since the nocturnal behavior reported by the patients often does not show up in the laboratory.	3.39896329508288
To test the efficacy of sleep deprivation as a tool to provoke somnambulism we investigated ten patients (three women and seven men, mean age 27 +/- 3.4) with somnambulism.	3.4536105202701886
Their standard polysomnographies and videomonitored nocturnal behavior was compared to that of sex- and age-matched controls and to polysomnography and behavior after sleep deprivation.	3.40299793084381
Patients with parasomnias and controls did not show significant differences in sleep parameters with the exception of longer arousal duration in controls, which was nonsignificant.	3.8867171681605623
In magnetic resonance tomography, patients with parasomnias did not reveal abnormality of the brain that might explain release of nocturnal behavior.	3.985322328754109
Sleep deprivation led to significantly reduced number of arousals, reduced arousal index, significantly prolonged arousal duration and more stage shifts from all sleep stages (nonsignificant).	2.87213562606064
Complex behavior during sleep increased under sleep deprivation, whereas sleepwalking did not increase.	3.2775925288786114
The majority of complex behavior during sleep is triggered by stage shifts and not by arousal in the sense of the arousal definition of the American Sleep Disorder Society.	3.236506424235205
Complex behavior in sleep is stereotypical and nonviolent.	3.0537041609364337
Its complexity seems to depend on the duration and intensity of arousals.	3.789064460606929
Sleep deprivation can be recommended as an efficacious method of increasing complex behavior in sleep, which is a preliminary stage of sleepwalking.	3.732257989451601
Concerning the underlying pathology it seems to be important to register the quality and duration of stimuli that trigger arousals instead of focusing the number of arousals alone.	4.286107237987471
Introduction: In order to investigate whether operative technique determines the 5-year recurrence and survival rates, we analysed the results obtained by two surgical departments using two different operative techniques.	4.020329155268214
Department A: Removal of the tumour and a number of lymph nodes; department B: En-bloc resection in accordance with the requirements of standardised tumour surgery.	4.015474952077261
Patients and methods: The surgical results obtained with all patients with colorectal carcinoma operated on between 1984 and 1988 (department A: 152 colon and 53 rectal carcinomas; department B: 124 colon and 177 rectal carcinomas).	3.0667725756976605
Results: The local recurrence rate achieved by department A was signicantly higher (colon carcinoma: department A 25 %; department B 10 %; rectal carcinoma: department A 54 %; department B 16 %).	2.8537978332640717
The 5-year survival rate for colon carcinoma was 65 % in department A, and 66 % in department B, the corresponding figures for rectal carcinoma being 49 % and 72 %, respectively.	2.8381688932628366
Conclusion: The results indicate that carcinoma of the colorectum should be operated on only at an institution that complies with the standards required for surgery of colorectal carcinoma.	3.399264968511361
The practice of ethics consultation, as performed at the Freiburg University Hospital is described and illustrated by a case report about the problem of treatment termination.	3.781156376567267
The range of subject matters that come up in ethics consultations is analyzed.	2.6989622990854727
A research program in clinical ethics is summarized that has been undertaken to pave the way for a specific and interdisciplinary analysis of needs; from there on, the investigation aims at further developing clinical ethics support services.	3.068652692545887
Suggestions for criteria of competence for ethics consultants are formulated on the basis of both the author's and international work.	3.6593105233387373
Finally, the issues of structural conditions for establishing clinical ethics in the German-speaking world are raised and the long-term prospect of ethics consultation as an instrument for learning and teaching ethics in the health-care system is highlighted.	3.3841269039413455
Objectives Bridging of an extensive bone defect with a long stem revision prosthesis anchored in the diaphysis to restore a pain free function of the limb.	3.631736168136686
A total of 205 patients suffering from stage I and stage II melanoma were investigated with reference to psychosocial stress, social support and attitude to offers of psychotherapeutic support.	3.486707127992749
Additional counselling by their dermatologist was considered helpful by 59% of the patients, and interviews with a psychotherapist, by 20%.	3.7802204343396704
Patients who where more anxious about a progression of the cancer and thought they had not been given sufficient information about their illness preferred to seek help from the dermatologist.	3.1264402446523634
Patients who appreciated additional counselling by a psychotherapist were usually those with a poorer prognosis for their melanoma and those on whom psychosocial distress weighed especially heavily and who had less social support.	2.9714479806895664
The original structure of the synovial membrane is completely destroyed in the rheumatoid synovium and is characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration, synoviocyte proliferation, neo-vascularization, and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins.	3.155742843609105
Adhesion molecules play an important role in the development of these pathologic changes.	3.8997731817403745
In this review we discuss the role of the adhesion receptors of the selectin, integrin and immunglobulin families and of the CD44 molecule in the cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory changes in rheumatoid arthritis.	3.0534041706944057
During the last five years several authors have reported largely satisfactory results, using the steroid intravenous anaesthetic eltanolone (pregnanolone) for induction of anaesthesia after administering a bolus dose.	3.0312936452161763
Until now, however, no investigations have been undertaken, dealing with the infusion pharmacokinetics of eltanolone after arterial blood sampling and using slow induction to quantify the concentration-effect relationship.	3.180241083360629
Secondary objectives were to assess the haemodynamic and respiratory effects.	3.924475879772155
Background: Intraoperative measurements of local intracapillary hemoglobin oxygenation of the human cochlea via the round window membrane have been shown to be possible using the Erlangen microlight-guided spectrophotometer.	3.409952892739362
The aim of the present study was to develop a new microlight guide suitable for measurements in the round window niche and to evaluate electrophysiologically the possible impact of the procedure on the cochlea.	3.1442730637272827
High-dose UVA1 therapy is an effective treatment of patients with acute atopic dermatitis.	4.431937203887593
However, some patients do not respond well to this new therapy.	3.0097546597928995
We attempted to further characterize the non-responder population in a retrospective study.	3.572105779137708
Two closely matched groups of responders (n=20) and non-responders (n=20) were compared.	3.569191136716405
No significant differences were observed between both groups with respect to the following parameters: skin type, minimal erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, and peripheral blood eosinophils.	3.3580608796584417
However, non-responders were characterized by a highly elevated atopic score, and by high levels of total IgE and of specific IgE.	4.165378245153806
Furthermore, colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus occured at higher densities, and intestinal growth of Candida albicans was more frequently observed.	3.5324104474650446
These data indicate that high-dose UVA1 irradiation is not effective in all patients suffering from atopic dermatitis.	4.421381195115362
We conclude that non-responders with complicating infections might benefit from the combination of high-dose UVA1 therapy and antibiotic or antimycotic treatment.	3.324755438903124
Introduction: Many causes are given as  the main reason for inadequate pain therapy.	3.688425883964383
We report a woman with erythema palmare hereditarium, an anomaly not documented so far in the German literature.	2.7320905840266914
It is characterized by a bright erythema of the palms, usually persistent since birth.	2.917491453931088
It is transmitted in an autosomal-recessive mode and has a benign course.	3.7294745207155393
In our patient it was possible to trace the palmar erythema over three generations.	3.0244671059985992
The decline of STD in the region of Rostock, Germany, since 1945 is explained by a decreasing incidence of gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis.	3.2841687442278675
On the other hand chlamydial and candidal infections have increased.	2.7094074609060574
The rate of chlamydia infections was about 45% in our venerological patients, as common as gonorrhea used to be.	3.0755138766986456
Genital candidal infections were to be found in 23%.	3.772240003053277
Mycoplasmas were identified in 15%, usually combined with other pathogens except in some cases of vaginitis.	4.119717125952338
The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has changed considerably in the last few decades.	3.8750802643145317
Clinical observation of mainly unicentric pathogenesis with continuous expansion and subclinical involvement of adjoining regions of lymph nodes has resulted in the introduction of a large-field technique with total nodal irradiation (TNI) or total lymphatic irradiation (TLI).	3.2805836719782775
The introduction of polychemotherapy has led to further improvement in the cure rate and in considerations concerning using both methods and adapting them to the stage and risk.	3.4386618948475407
Today the combination of radiation and chemotherapy leads to a reduction in the amount of radiation required in the affected regions (involved field irradiation = IFI).	3.9512096014838196
The German Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was founded by Martin Waßmund in 1951.	2.819843121039696
One of the main reasons was the need for scientific representation in the council at a medical convention.	3.516740300094513
The Society, originally composed of 52 members, was first called "The German Society of Maxillofacial Surgery".	3.088008169572412
In 1972, it extended its title to include the term "oral" ("Mund") and currently comprises 620 members.	2.8376156754752895
The lectures given there have been published since 1954 in "Fortschritte der Kiefer- und Gesichts-Chirurgie" (Progress in Maxillofacial Surgery) by Thieme Verlag; since 1997, they have appeared as a Springer-Verlag supplement.	2.8584017299729005
Topics of choice are published in "Mund,- Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie" ("Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery"), originally by Hanser in Munich and now by Springer-Verlag in Heidelberg.	2.8651671633529316
In this manner, it was possible to completely document the scientific activities and progress in this specialty.	3.256772702386118
Each year since 1957, a prize named after M. Waßmund, has been given for outstanding scientific accomplishment.	3.0981916122662723
In order to intertwine scientific and political interests, a fusion of these two organizations is planned for the year 2000.	3.2341091744068056
The hepatorenal syndrome is defined as the development of renal failure in patients with severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable cause of renal functional impairment.	4.909585176162079
The pathogenesis of this obviously functional renal failure is complex and not completely understood.	2.834580185706155
Nitric oxide seems to play a major role as a possible primary mediator.	3.788628250227006
As a consequence changes in several different pathophysiological mechanisms (sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin, endothelin, prostanoids, natriuretic peptides) lead to a functional renal impairment which is characterized by renal cortical vasoconstriction.	2.9709492842102674
The mortality is still high exceeding 90%.	3.3867116822070042
Renal extracorporeal support should be initiated using a continuous method when recovery of liver function is expected (acute liver failure, waiting for liver transplantation).	3.2668273025757486
The only effective and permanent treatment is orthotopic liver transplantation.	2.941522357342845
A 16 year old patient with the typical clinical signs of Albright's hereditary dystrophia developed series of epileptic seizures with loss of consciousness, tonic muscle contractions and bite of the tongue.	3.626635428374463
After termination of the seizures there was coma without focal neurological signs.	2.9286064533407283
CT scan revealed diffuse brain edema.	3.515847937676971
Electroencephalographic studies showed generalized slowing.	3.7090855791991983
In laboratory tests the only abnormalities were marked hypocalcemia (1.15 mmol/l) and hyperphosphatemia.	3.0538064694154543
Blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) was elevated.	3.1062866670934675
PTH-Test confirmed the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism.	4.325011824266361
The patient was treated with calcium and 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol.	3.2540954455066466
Hereditary disturbances of the parathyroid hormone metabolism are rare diseases.	4.132341779111213
Hypocalcemia must be included into the differential diagnosis of seizures and brain edema to avoid invasive diagnostic and irrational treatment.	3.554577753957304
An adequate increase of uterine blood flow throughout gestation is essential for uterine, placental and fetal growth.	3.115303705892736
Maternal cardiovascular adaptation has to provide the uterine perfusion that is necessary to meet the requirements of the developing and growing fetus by providing transport of nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and the fetus.	3.554893520924382
Thus uterine blood flow is inextricably linked to fetal growth and survival.	3.441855964720836
Reductions of uterine blood flow can occur under acute or chronic conditions or in a combination of both.	3.94692173313528
Chronic restrictions in uterine blood flow will elicit a placental and fetal response in the form of growth adaptation to the reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients to the conceptus.	3.253219324982247
If compensatory growth restriction reaches its limits intrauterine fetal distress can ensue.	2.9220674310938057
In view of a possible Stent implantation, 20 infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated.	2.9823430126096007
Measurements were performed according to toporegional criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters.	3.2642382900553875
Then we correlated the extent of the proximal and distal necks to the aneurysmal lengths and diameters, respectively.	3.3528482480614072
The following results were obtained: 1.	3.255623369283302
Depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm, there is an inproportional shortening of the proximal and distal neck.	4.272627328717224
Up to an aneurysmal length of 4 cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases.	2.883797821868282
With lengths of more than 4 cm according to the morphological results, the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple Tube-Stent.	3.8375149036645206
The proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of 10 cm.	3.3387728076116856
For longer aneurysms, only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation.	4.159452785883574
In all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall-adherent thrombi of up to three centimeter thickness in the aneurysmal and para-aneurysmal regions.	2.913713473029927
These findings have to be considered, with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta.	4.339345151007899
We report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48-year-old man.	2.9219830859184786
These slow-growing, mostly benign and encapsulated intradural-extramedullar tumours are clinically characterized by lumbago, paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as occasi-onally by incontinence.	3.134435159158899
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina show monomorphous (main) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern, demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so-called sustentacular cells; some tumours show focal ganglionic differentiation.	2.693538394431542
Because of their morphological similarity to the more common ependymomas, paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated.	3.1823366347922466
Immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides (main cells) and S-100 protein (sustentacular cells) while widely lacking reactivity for GFAP.	3.172146313818025
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity, of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature.	3.2465492685970245
Because they only occur sporadically, they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina.	4.087105482937318
Approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence.	3.6576301649189897
The treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence, the type of primary therapy administered and the patient's general condition.	3.712951052357687
The limit conditions for the application of the established forms of therapy available - surgical operation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy - are complex and seldom documented by randomized studies.	3.7064345271495656
In general, empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned.	2.77825041741246
The main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences.	4.253714909494984
Post-traumatic pyogenic liver abscess is a rare disease.	3.2187222399753597
We present the case of a 38-year-old man with multilocular liver abscess and pleural empyema following blunt abdominal trauma.	2.951541601152697
The patient had a prodrome lasting 3 months before presenting in our department.	3.0596738802751005
The therapy included partial hepatectomy and pleural drainage.	2.9138863807077606
Clinical signs, diagnosis and possible therapy are discussed in this case report.	4.866150110160947
The dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his/her facility: admission, diagnosis, treatment, transfer, and discharge of patients.	3.195773611774184
However, in developing such general hospital information systems, one runs into the following problems: (1) medical and administrative information systems form a very heterogeneous environment; (2) the structure of medical information is extremely complex, except for certain limited administrative data (admission, transfer, and discharge, for example) needed by the clinic administration.	3.3816068185705723
As a result it is nearly impossible to transfer medical information from one system to another without a loss of data.	2.957991994576898
One cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years.	3.0658004199284448
Shave excision of nevi is a technique still under debate.	3.088639103840531
Speed, simplicity, and the fact that it provides excised material for histologic examination are contrasted with the lack of excision margins and a higher rate of nevus recurrences.	3.9054119153931994
In this study, the pros and cons of shave excision were evaluated.	2.5664552193401056
They are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy.	3.4549050501112615
There are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity, cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane.	3.1306229785205963
In addition, patients with apparent CDA of heterogenous phenotype are observed, that cannot be attributed to any of the three types.	3.8401316447999747
Recently variant genes have been localized to different regions on chromosome 15 or 22.	3.1827593386249435
Cases of CDA were reported from many ethnics, in particular in families of meditarranean origin.	3.238759481799767
Many patients load iron necessitating iron depletion.	2.908710934069521
Gallstones are a frequent complication and are observed in childhood or adolescence.	3.9856105161290754
Therapeutic measures such as splenectomy, treatment by Interferon  or allogeneic bome marrow transplantation depend on the type and the severity of clinical expression, which shows large variations both within and between affected kindreds.	3.3202069903021085
Observed over long periods, it can reach 1% per year.	3.7855616790178575
But it is such a tenuous phenomenon that it cannot be observed over short periods at steady state.	2.8511646280698386
The aging phenomenon mainly hits fibers, Type II but on aged muscle thin, normal, and hypertrophic fibers cohabit with sclerosis and fat increases.	2.7637701368128886
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterised by stage-dependent microangiopathy.	3.5523025843192233
With increasing severity there is a decrease in the number of skin capillaries and the oxygen partial pressure.	3.908095901239463
The cutaneous vascular reserve, which is measured by laser-doppler fluxmetry, is reduced.	3.774329630623617
Cutaneous microangiopathy is one of the main causes of the trophic disturbances associated with CVI.	3.4385622030912897
Low frequency pulsed current improves cutaneous microcirculation and thus nutrition as well as accelerating the formation of granulation tissue.	3.6667322638823987
In a open prospective pilot study, 15 patients suffering from CVI with persistent leg ulcers were treated with low frequency pulsed current (Dermapulse), which is thought to improve particularly the tissue microcirculation.	3.9577818006856007
The average age of the patients was 70.3 years and the average duration of ulceration was 79.1 months.	3.4269434911369667
The patients were treated over a period of 38 days.	3.862302682431107
Capillary density increased by 43.5%, while transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure increased by 82.4%.	3.1781465578250216
Electrostimulation is a treatment with few or no side effects.	3.6637084159005515
Of the 89 uncemented cups, 59 were threaded cups (Hofer-Imhof n = 45, Zweymüller n = 7, Mecring n = 5, PM n = 2) and 30 were hemispherical cups of the Harris Galante type I and II.	2.834760589711595
87 stems were implanted without cement (Zweymüller SL n = 58, Uni n = 16, Schenker n = 9, Zweymüller I n = 4) and 5 with cement.	3.2447495713351318
One patient died postoperatively and three (4 implants) within the first year.	3.299137370892015
To date, one cup of each threaded type had to be revised because of loosening (revision rate approx.	3.007579431254247
3.4 %) stem revisions (1 x Zweymüller I, 1 x Schenker, 1 x Zweymüller SL) have been undertaken.	3.6680352756463845
Ten patients with twelve hip arthroplasties did not return for follow-up; some of them had a poor general health status.	3.516550058121309
The clinical and radiological results of the arthroplasties of 52 patients showed a Harris Hip Score averaging 72 after an average of 54 months (min.	4.000019715392652
Ten patients had minor complaints in the hip region.	3.246755841047232
79 % of the uncemented implants (70 out of 89 cups, 69 out of 87 stems) were assessed radiologically.	3.125161076182519
Two threaded cups showed slight migration after cancellous bone grafting in the presence of acetabular protrusion that was present in a total of 13 hip joints.	3.761472583939418
Homogeneous incorporation of the bone grafting und thus remodelling of the medial wall was achieved, with the bone graft exhibiting marked reduction.	4.443885631911521
At final follow-up, approx.	3.9085689860317987
75 % of the cementless cups had complete bone ingrowth without any evidence of radiolucency (type I), approx.	2.898664013922431
19 % had near-complete bone ingrowth with minimal radiolucencies in one zone or in a maximum of 50 % of the bone contact area (type II) and approx.	3.1476416678822874
6 % had radiolucencies in more than 50 % of the bone contact area (type III).	3.031958932262272
The radiographic evaluation of the most frequently used stem (Zweymüller SL) showed approx.	4.462055036429648
47 % with only slight remodelling of the calcar (type I), approx.	2.999030759384281
33 % with moderate loss of femoral density (type II) and approx.	2.9758673097334163
20 % with severe bone loss and thinning of cortical bone (type III).	3.106680973006937
Abstract   The 5th edition of the TNM classification entails a number of changes concerning head and neck tumors.	3.0904857193048203
The division of stage IV tumors into three subcategories marks a significant expansion of the stage grouping procedure.	3.037783629864109
Methods: In a retrospective study the clinical course of 3247 patients with head and neck carcinomas were comparatively evaluated according to the 4th and 5th editions of the new TNM classification.	3.3662662211404326
In particular it was the aim of the study to test the prognostic relevance of the subdivision of stage IV especially in mucosal cancer.	3.511651939358869
Results: In classifying the primary tumor the most extensive changes were noted for supraglottic and salivary gland tumors.	3.2503204819689615
On the basis of the 4th edition of the TNM classification the following recurrence-free 5-year survival rates for 3033 cases of mucosal cancer were calculated: stage I 91,0%, stage II 78,6%, stage III 61,4%, stage IV 31,0%.	2.8473970982685417
The calculations based on the 5th edition yielded: stage I 91,0%, stage II 77,2%, stage III 61,2%, stage IVA 32,4%, stage IVB 25,3%, stage IVC 3,6%.	3.3791758888263144
Conclusions: The adequacy of the revised stage classification in establishing a prognostic hierarchy was confirmed.	2.8901874103488647
However, a significant prognostic distinction between N2- (stage IVA) and N3-metastasis (stage IVB) could not be found.	3.2152568586566934
The microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue, and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell.	3.767328001005599
Modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high-resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer-assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock-out gene technology.	3.645795009985308
These advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, and transplantation.	2.940616547653347
Legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Germany.	3.3045943624974297
This article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against PGD.	3.0083531866015645
Inconsistencies in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept PGD are highlighted.	3.03001167517888
The use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing PGD is criticised.	2.961331449215844
Extensive counselling prior to PGD should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision.	3.60414322644856
The SOFA score, a new system for patients with sepsis-related diseases, was introduced in 1994 by the "Working Group on Sepsis-Related Problems of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine."	3.520996382972535
The purpose of this study was to compare the new SOFA score with the APACHE II and MOD scores.	2.518868153698377
The data on 874 patients from a surgical intensive care unit in an university hospital were analyzed using commercially available software (SPSS for Windows, Version 7.5.2 and MS Excel '97).	2.840111822338907
To compare the different scores, receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) - analyses were applied.	3.0355720205666006
The study demonstrated a clear correlation between an elevated SOFA score and the mortality of the patients during their ICU stay (score 0 -> mortality 0 %, 1 -> 3.6 %, 2 -> 22.5 %, 3 -> 86,7 %, respectively r = 0.445; P = 0,01).	3.828862538541142
The ROC analyses of the APACHE II, the MOD and the SOFA scores were comparable (area under the curve: APACHE II 0.73, MOD 0.77, SOFA 0.71).	2.8406102841433576
In conclusion, the SOFA score is reliable and might be useful in the daily routine of an intensive care unit.	2.957068356668642
In individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome.	3.1342073825398025
For the first time we investigated a total of 100 HNSCC by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis.	3.5518978999118125
Patients were followed for at latest 4 but at least 2 years after surgery or until death.	3.754092008163179
During this observation period twenty-nine of them died because of cancer disease.	3.539959507618496
The Kaplan-Meier method was used plotting survival curves for every single chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico-pathological parameter.	3.382002656063386
The curves were tested for significance by the log rank as well as the Breslow test.	3.686432459373017
Significance of particular prognostic parameters was then evaluated by the Cox regression model.	3.3653341487472823
The overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly lower in patients who's tumors showed amplifications of the chromosomal region 11q13 (p=0.0008 for LR and p=0.0024 for B).	3.044659286050105
The survival time of the patients was also lower if the carcinomas carried overrepresentations of chromosome 3q (p=0.0299 for LR and p=0.0546 for B).	3.2202168358190453
Multivariate analysis (Cox's proportional hazards model) revealed both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in HNSCC.	3.0391817069928093
None of the conventional clinico-pathological parameters (pT-, pN-status, UICC stage, grading) achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model.	2.9207535490918994
These results suggest that in HNSCC the occurence of 11q13 amplification and 3q overrepresentation are highly significant independent prognostic markers and of better value than the established TNM and grading criteria.	2.9194815497061666
We report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient.	3.518163967365709
The foamy cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed S-100 and Vimentin.	3.2616759581088246
HMB45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma.	3.9009195685895794
Detection of HMB45 in some of the nevus-associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation.	3.6076912845484417
We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a malignant, primary plaque-type blue naevus in a 61-year-old male.	3.7385372936296175
Two biopsy specimens had been examined within 13 years, and revealed a common and cellular blue variant as a precursor.	3.648577304696159
Locally invasive growth and regional lymph node swelling were present, but these alone could not confirm malignancy before evaluation of all clinical and histopathological features, as they are known to occur with benign cellular blue naevi.	3.9094735486001824
The recent literature and our case indicate that there is a malignant potential in every histological and clinical variant of blue naevus.	3.6011163476530945
It is difficult to provide valid data with regard to changes in incidence and prevalence of acute pancreatitis in Germany.	3.635403451207207
The lack of information is due to strict legal regulations to protect personal data, a certain lack of interest in epidemiological research and the lack of exact statistics of diseases treated in hospitals.	3.4874104773597803
The incidence of acute pancreatitis in other industrialized Western countries is about 10 new cases per year and 100,000 inhabitants.	3.0944214145326185
The increase of alcohol consumption over the last 30 years is associated with an increase of ethanol-induced pancreatitis.	3.7865059893425412
One may speculate that due to improved diagnostic possibilities, such as CT scan, cases where acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at autopsy are rare.	3.4756110472957276
Due to the increase in alcohol consumption it can be assume that the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis have increased in Germany similar to well-documented data from Denmark.	3.900395518181568
Since alcohol consumption is slightly decreasing in Germany it is likely that the present incidence of about 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis per 100,000 inhabitants will also decrease.	3.40210024584354
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, estecming, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapie.	1.7096218019460343
This form of treatment is scientifically validated (Grawe 1997).	3.1738512739800986
Its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	2.0551094743438485
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	1.6916840258662025
This second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks.	3.286829022136668
At last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed, and available outcome data is summarized.	3.338946862528065
The human arterial blood pressure shows not only exogenic alterations, but also spontaneous fluctuations.	3.741113023909259
This blood pressure variability has both scientific and clinical relevance.	3.7866808296445336
A well-known phenomenon is the so-called "white coat hyptertension" which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension.	3.8157900872877977
Furthermore, several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end-organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the circardian blood pressure variability.	3.9842732625026116
Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration.	4.224426169838097
The faeces sign is a recently described computed tomography (CT) feature of small-bowel obstruction and is seen as a mottled, faeces-like content within the lumen of the dilated loops above the level of the obstacle.	3.226313934178407
To evaluate its prevalence, significance, and diagnostic value we retrospectively reviewed 94 consecutive cases of small-intestine obstruction studied with CT in the last 6 years.	3.39044141014472
The faeces sign was recognizable in 7 cases (7.4 %) and was localized within ileal loops in all these subjects.	3.254407316902091
In 6 of the 7 cases there was a simple and progressive obstruction, while there was a sudden onset with intestinal strangulation in only 1.	3.6617628408327074
In our experience it is relatively uncommon.	2.734984116204286
A case report is presented to illustrate the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythaemia.	3.352939699864287
Knowledge of the related skin lesions may lead to earlier detection of this myeloproliferative disorder.	3.4633494777920713
Treatment may prevent severe haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications.	3.1290145218667247
Erythromelalgia is causally related to thrombocythaemia; prompt relief of painful symptoms after treatment with aspirin is typical.	3.3363385133394905
Surgical treatment of proximal aortic disease traditionally consists of composite replacement of valve and aorta.	2.96271519703117
Recent reconstructive procedures on the aortic root allow for treatment of aortic dilatation and concomitant aortic valve regurgitation without the associated disadvanteages of mechanical heart valves.	3.3143264271980435
Two psychotic patients developed hyperglycaemia several weeks after starting olanzapine.	3.1458450112583
In one case the elevated glucose concentrations returned to normal soon after withdrawal of olanzapine.	2.7668933638066053
In the second case severe ketoacidosis with letal outcome occured.	2.5332837847988228
Profilometry is a novel procedure allowing precise analysis of skin surface structure.	3.464301097338269
With the help of a synthetic material a negative image of a defined area of the skin is taken.	3.8870700707411743
During the subsequent analytical procedure the roughness is determined by means of a profilometer.	3.5094169401902144
A commercially available statistics software program is used for statistical analysis of the results.	3.665143679911598
This procedure was applied to check for to evaluate positive effects of oestrogen creams on the structure of the skin surface on the face.	3.990523642793812
This article describes the historic roots of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) from the first experiments at 1800 until the introduction into the pharmaceutical market in 1899.	2.660450175355383
In 1869, Hermann Kolbe enlightened the chemical structure of salicylic acid, which was used at that time as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	2.9857337891720497
Because of the side effects, for example the irritation of the stomach, analytical chemists and pharmacologists searched for chemical modifications.	3.4905524718523324
In August 1897 Felix Hoffmann (1868-1946) was successful in acetylizing the salicylic acid to acetylsalicyl acid (ASA).	2.6235415834082505
Between 1897 and 1899 Kurt Witthauer (1865-1911) collected clinical data and experiences on the efficiency of ASA as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	2.6556571074532984
In 1899 ASA was introduced into the pharamaceutical market as Aspirin and became soon one of the most successful drugs of its time.	3.2773418261521075
The indication exceeds analgesia in the mean time and to prophylaxis of myocardial ischaemia or cerebral stroke, among others.	3.4136409186899503
Background: The results of the Cryo-ROP group showed that cryotherapy significantly reduces the rate of adverse morphological and functional outcome of eyes with threshold retinopathy of prematurity.	3.5590539208643093
Structural status and visual acuity of 48 eyes which consecutively underwent cryocoagulation in our hospital between 1990 and 1994 were examined at 2 years corrected gestational age.	3.1697440810707103
Despite wide-spread immunisation programs epidemic influenza continues to cause ten thousands of deaths worldwide, every year, especially in the high risk groups of elderly or immunocompromised persons.	3.268429831130937
At present, amantadine and rimantadine are the only approved agents available for prophylactic and therapeutic use, yet, the deployment of these substances is problematic: neither of the two drugs is effective against influenza B, their use is accompanied by rapid development of viral resistance, and they show many adverse effects.	3.3963889699496628
In contrast, zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are rationally developed influenza-specific neuraminidase inhibitors, proving prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against influenza A and B, as well in vitro as in animal models, and in experimental human studies.	3.4374302639639676
Zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are well tolerated without adverse reactions after topic and oral administration, respectively.	2.9698785919320083
Resistant viral strains have been found in cell culture in the presence of both drugs, but the frequency of resistance emergence during clinical use is unclear.	4.755179688774315
To date, the biggest recognizable disadvantage of neuraminidase inhibitors and Amantadin/Rimantadin alike is that they need to be given within 30-48 h after onset of symptoms, but seeking medical attention at this stage of infection does not seem to be realistic in medical practice.	3.121482628892786
As neuraminidase inhibitors up to now could mainly be assessed by experimental data, specifically performed clinical trials will have to prove the positive influence of these drugs on the morbidity, course of infection, and mortality of high risk persons when administered for prophylaxis as well as for therapy.	4.063657888135572
Background and purpose: Without recanalisation, acute basilar artery (BA) occlusion has a mortality of 90 %, which is reduced to 50 % if recanalisation is achieved.	3.313664376678871
Fast diagnosis of BA occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay.	3.8158067463433913
We wanted to assess the role of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected acute BA occlusion.	4.20144931283166
25 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD, 62  +/-  9 years) and 18 subjects free from cardiovascular disease (28  +/-  9 years) were tested on a cycle ergometer using a graded incremental test protocol: a) in the common upright position, b) as dynamic stress echocardiography in a semi-supine position.	3.8149995575958586
Whereas no relevant differences could be detected between the two conditions for the healthy subjects concerning heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product (2 x 3 ANOVA, t-test with -adjustment), the CHD patients showed both significantly higher heart rates as well as a significantly higher rate-pressure product (50 W: 15 300  +/-  2973 mmHg/min vs. 13 822  +/-  3042 mmHg/min; 75 W: 18 028  +/-  3479 mmHg/min vs 16 337  +/-  2619 mmHg/min) on equivalent stages during stress echocardiography if compared to the sitting position.	3.382530373919512
There were no differences for systolic blood pressure in this group; the diastolic values were higher in the sitting position at rest and during 50 W. Lactate concentrations (determined only in the healthy subjects) were significantly higher on all stages during dynamic stress echocardiography.	3.6396983524952717
The workload at the individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) was significantly lower.	3.7483700297606517
A new stoechiometric mixture of 27% dicalcium-phosphate (DCPA) and 73% tetra-calcium-phosphate (TTCP) can be prepared with water intraoperatively to a paste that subsequently sets to a structurally stabile implant composed of hydroxyapatite (HA).	2.6737794791226346
Primary setting time is about 20 min; pH during setting ranges from 6.5 to 8.5.	3.047358089406732
There is no relevant curing heat or expansion or contraction.	2.725403412300027
Compressive strength is about 50 MPa, tensile strength about 8 MPa.	3.1596198890492895
Over a period of about 4 h in physiological milieu, the cement converts to hydroxyapatite.	3.0325982374634397
This product is no longer redissolvable  in normal body fluid.	3.630597324286427
This cement can be used for non-load-bearing applications especially in craniofacial bone surgery.	3.7382952291606335
In nine of ten patients we used the hydroxyapatite cement successfully for reconstructions in the craniofacial area.	3.3074207838958123
Fluid control of the operation field and implant site is extremely important and sometimes difficult to achieve.	4.190080588400924
Further applications could be all non-load-bearing augmentations such as filling of blocked paranasal sinuses, of dentoalveolar cysts and defects following dental apectomy or fixation of implanted hearing-aid electrodes.	2.688544828761507
The perspectives for the hydroxyapatite cement include its application as a carrier for osteogenic protein preparations, especially because of its isothermic reaction and intrinsic osteoconductive characteristics.	2.8972268901084908
We present a non-invasive epilepsy surgery protocol, which includes EEG-video-monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT).	2.8146963730619943
According to this non-invasive protocol 50 of 173 patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy underwent resective surgery.	2.9349393838235356
The localization of the epileptogenic zone was based on the congruence of the localizing results of EEG-video-montoring, MRI, interictal PET and ictal SPECT.	3.138034862402959
78% (n=39) of all patients operated according to our non-invasive protocol were postoperatively completely or almost seizure free.	3.671958916081856
Extramesiotemporal resections could be carried out without invasive EEG-recording if the epileptogenic zone was not adjacent to the eloquent cortex.	3.051581288770449
We conclude from our results that in a considerable number of patients with medically intractable particularly temporal focal epilepsies, resective epilepsy surgery can be based on non-invasive EEG-evaluations and the risk of invasive recordings can be avoided.	4.012923062895166
Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is mostly associated with a pancreatic-A-cell-glucagonoma and is considered to be a well-defined cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome.	3.9006898418088616
We report on a 74-year old female who atypically developed a NME after surgical treatment of a rectal adenocarcinoma.	3.6611844858076887
Continuous staging and laboratory investigation over four years gave no evidence of any metastasis or further neoplasia.	3.275263187720965
Hair samples and perspiration collected from long term drug addicts (n = 18) under constant methadone treatment were investigated.	3.120799408095788
Hair segments representing the individual hair growth of 4 weeks were analyzed for methadone, opiates and cocaine by GC/MS.	3.338907359821282
The results obtained from the transdermal collection devices confirmed the presence of drug substances in variable amounts on the skin surface, methadone being the main analyte.	3.6057762894423213
The perspiration test period lasted for 4 days.	3.4734186316419677
For six persons illicit drugs similar to those in the corresponding hair samples were found.	3.3574990523538633
Overall, a poor relationship (r = 0,602) was found between the methadone dose under steady state conditions and the methadone level in hair.	3.3061125212359594
The results are discussed in the light of pharmacokinetic aspects, drug uptake by perspiration and forensic interpretation.	3.070723492298358
Bilateral carotid artery dissection is a rare and unusual complication of blunt cervicofacial trauma.	3.4519337538041515
The diagnosis of a carotid injury is rarely suspected in trauma patients with neurological deficits.	3.1735835505414265
Neurological symptoms may develop in a delayed fashion.	3.4442212440586633
Angiography should be considered in trauma patients with hemiplegia and a normal mental status and in patients with blunt cervical trauma with an abnormal neurological examination.	4.237138573377838
Initial heparinisation can prevent arterial thrombosis and neurological deterioration.	3.3400969264332954
The authors report their findings which are based on 10 years of interdisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of chronic pain patients.	3.8818850344829756
They point out the practical use of their findings in daily practice.	3.5023712738049477
Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmHg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria.	3.5278645393391255
In primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis, ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma.	2.9934812075030752
Secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery.	4.095979164950576
The effects are decreased cardiac output, pulmonary atelectasis, oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion.	3.4889784159507866
Effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure.	3.4821159066154443
Normal values are between 0 and 7 cm H2O, after elective laparotomies 5-12 cm H20.	3.512508719052505
Above 25 cm H20 they are definitely pathological.	3.42927342313233
For the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended.	3.7309684759513413
Between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in 377 patients.	2.8517769457590783
In 16 % of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31  +/-  4 cm H20 preoperatively, which could be lowered to 17  +/-  4 cm H20 by laparostomy.	3.9233524716891766
An early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18 % of the cases.	4.9790551260349565
Conclusions: The abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems.	3.207171694281146
The temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances.	3.592756587876488
In general, assessment of the correct placement of a central venous catheter is performed by fluoroscopy or by postinsertional chest X-ray.	3.0950217602103054
We report a case of intraaortic malposition of a central venous catheter in a 59-year-old male patient that was not detectable in chest films.	2.9649400230571916
Further exploration of this patient revealed a left-sided superior vena cava.	3.4595498073048327
Definition of the problem: In 1997, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) was performed in 138.001 cases in Germany.	3.3119854723386783
The standard indications, single vessel disease and badly controlled angina, are more and more extended to multivessel disease with and without severe angina, unstable or preinfarction angina, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) itself.	3.1773385783233468
Dilating asymptomatic stenoses of more than 70-80% is a widely used indication, intending prophylaxis of complete occlusion and AMI.	3.5118020542046997
Actually there is no generally accepted guideline for the different new indications, conservative versus invasive treatment schedule.	3.5859496413665655
It is difficult for the patient to get appropriate information before his decision between mechanical procedures and conservative methods; authentic informed consent actually seems to be in a very bad position.	3.607101363879121
In 1992 the working group called "Arbeitsgemeinschaft leitender kardiologischer Krankenhausärzte (ALKK)" decided to start a registry of all PTCA procedures, in order to gain knowledge about the present status of PTCA in Germany.	3.061054064173249
Up to March 1999, 198.608 PTCA are logged.	2.917032020891143
Two children developed multiple melanocytic naevi after polychemotherapy administered for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in one and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the other.	3.324147164316693
Induction of naevi does not seem to be related to specific agents used in chemotherapy, but rather to the immunosuppression resulting from multiple-agent chemotherapy.	3.1104492301622146
There are reports in the literature of both intrinsically and iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients who have developed multiple melanocytic naevi.	3.1687423483133967
Many small randomized studies with <beta>-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure have been published in recent years.	3.7903485836137243
A large meta-analysis by Lechat combining 18 studies with 3023 patients showed a 32% reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers.	3.1366057181844633
Mortality and hospitalization together were reduced by 37%.	3.312354707972468
In 1998 two large randomized trials investigating Bisoprolol (CIBIS II) and Metoprolol (MERIT-HF) were finished.	2.806967392015749
Both studies show a significant reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers.	3.6053156153758317
The ongoing COMET study compares <beta>1-selective blockers like metoprolol with vasodilatative <beta>-blockers like carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure.	3.105144092090816
Large clinical registries demonstrate clinical practicability of <beta>-blocker treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.	3.5224123974721997
All patients with stabel chronic heart failure ought to be treated with <beta>-blockers additional to a basic therapy with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis.	3.220922691864625
The <beta>-blocker therapy regimen is to start with low doses and to increase the dose carefully:"Start low and go slow".	3.4401140078500383
Purpose: Cardiac imaging includes determination of the size and structure of the cardiac chambers, valves, great vessels and the coronary arteries, chamber and valvular function, myocardial perfusion, viability and metabolism.	3.826382372643036
A 52-year-old patient presenting with severe thoracic pain of more than 30 minutes duration and ST-segment elevation > 1 mV in leads V1-3 was given 100 mg rt-PA. With persisting thoracic pain and ST-segment elevation, coronary angiography was performed 90 minutes after administration of thrombolytic therapy.	3.132344656118701
Surprisingly, angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in presence of marked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	3.0819977006999544
New onset of thoracic pain after four hours led to chest raiograph demonstrating increased mediastinal widening and new pleural effusion as compared to a baseline chest film prior to rt-PA. Spiral computed tomography revealed overt Type B aortic dissection with an intimal flap and communication distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with signs of a mediastinal hematoma.	3.31987778101438
Immediate cardiac surgery with replacement of the dissected aortic segment was successfully performed.	3.4365855539400463
A literature review revealed 4% of aortic dissection to present with electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction and 13% to have concomitant coronary artery disease; moreover 34 cases of aortic dissection were misdiagnosed as infarction and subjected to thrombolytic agents with a mortality of 64% underlining the importance of exclusion of dissection prior to thombolytic therapy.	3.280786855331451
Between 1984 and 1996 we performed a Mason gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity: 14 patients (average age 40 (26-48) years, body mass index (BMI) 48 (37-71) kg/m2, excessive body weight 67 (41-116) kg).	3.1174144516506543
Since the end of 1996 we now apply adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding (lab band): 73 patients (average age 39 (22-64) years, BMI 45 (32-69) kg/m2, excessive body weight 66 (41-116) kg).	2.831532999839563
We compared the early and late results of both methods.	3.4929326013591986
Early results: no relevant morbidity or mortality for neither method.	3.196930907591852
Late/intermediate results: reoperation rate for both methods 15 %.	3.4052518322842142
After an average of 3.7 years the excessive body weight loss (EWL) for gastroplasty was 54 (22-96) %.	3.1191345395916565
The EWL after lab band for 24 patients after 12 months was 47 (11-127) % and for 8 patients after 18 months 51 (28-139) %.	3.3390920912440896
Since the introduction of the lap band the number of bariatric operations has greatly increased.	3.4715591048606154
Nevertheless, the perioperative complication rate has remained low, and the long-term outcome is similar for both methods.	4.118363686583408
We investigated the relationships between prolactin (PRL) levels and antibody occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	2.5025432082304615
No significant association between PRL levels and the majority of the autoantibodies studied (anti-U1 RNP, anti-rRNP, anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, anti-DNP, auto-LCA, anti-EACA) could be confirmed (P > 0.05), anti-Ro/SSA antibodies being an exception.	3.332349154003042
Our results showed significantly increased frequencies of these antibodies in the group of female SLE patients with normal PRL levels (< 20 µg/L): anti Ro/SSA in 53% (P < 0.025, 2 = 5.80, RR = 4.0) and anti-Ro/SSA + anti-Ro/La in 60% (P < 0.05, 2 = 4.05) compared with female SLE patients with hyperprolactinemia.	3.0408168596955107
An echinococcal cyst of the heart is a rare cause of acute cardiac tamponade.	3.9136909528130452
We report on a 24 year old male from the Kosovo who was brought in an emergency state from a provincial hospital complaining of severe dyspnea, thoracic pain, dizziness, and a short period of unconsciousness.	3.231352278278429
Surgical decompression had to be performed urgently, because the pericardium could not be punctuated due to the position of the hydatid cyst.	4.4770501072720155
We report on the case of a 51-year-old female patient who had been suffering from multiple itching nodules for 3 years.	3.1295934457035446
Some of these lesions were classified clinically and histologically as keratoacanthomas (KA), whereas the multiple smaller nodules were found on histological examination to be either early stage KA or lesions of prurigo simplex subacuta.	3.3766683062713474
In two KA, HPV subtype 2 was identified by in situ hybridization.	3.353853537341676
Treatment with etretinate resulted in remission of the fully developed KA and reduced the occurrence of new ones.	3.3284478758055127
The outbreak of multiple KA in our patient resembled a rare subtype described by Witten and Zak.	3.2068775694291705
This mode of prurigo-dependent KA development has not previously been reported.	3.106380228305218
We describe a rare case of a papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve occurring simultaneously with a cystic tumor (a so-called mesothelioma) of the atrioventricular nodal region.	4.128207983533002
At autopsy the tumor was found to prolapse into and occlude the right coronary ostium, leading to an acute, recurring myocardial infarction.	4.244568048794373
Histological examination of the grossly unremarkable conduction system of the heart revealed a cystic tumor in the region of the atrioventricular node.	4.179581886629042
To our knowledge, this is the first report of coexistence of these two rare cardiac tumors.	2.56981391153231
Although still rare, pregnancy and delivery in women with spinal cord injuries is becoming more frequent (Table 2).	3.2344234825276565
In anaesthesising a 31-year-old paraplegic primigravida with a complete transverse spinal lesion at T4 for an elective caesarean section, no indication of hypertonic cardiovascular dysregulation either intra- or postoperatively was observed after repeated epidural administration of bupivacaine.	3.079783270113875
Distinct intraoperative spasticity of the abdominal wall muscles was, however, not influenced by the dosages selected.	4.371595552722677
Repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless method to induce transient activation in circumscript regions of the human cortex.	3.7694973501424953
In contrast to TMS with single pulses rTMS allows a more effective stimulation of association cortex and temporary interference with the proper functioning of stimulated areas.	2.812510745904445
Possible applications for examination of the functional anatomy of language lateralisation, memory functions and visual perception are discussed.	3.4184001973798566
Possible therapeutic for movement  disorders and depression are discussed.	3.180732479858756
On the basis of theoretical considerations  and current experience rTMS induced epileptogenic effects are discussed and safety  recommendations are given.	2.999958501307251
An unusual shaped piece of skin was found in the oral cavity of a woman who had been stabbed to death.	4.046490436628922
Physical examination of the victim's numerous male acquaintances revealed one to have an injury of the same shape on the ventral surface of the left ring finger.	3.961641650997894
Molecular biological investigations showed that this suspect and the piece of skin exhibited corresponding DNA patterns (frequency 1 : 700 000).	2.867917037894919
This case underlines the importance of physical examination as a preliminary to further detailed investigation.	3.267678436996598
Nineteen men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence grade II and III (mean follow-up 12.7 months) underwent periurethral injections of collagen.	3.5519358241690737
In all, 37 procedures were performed; 58 % of the patients underwent the procedure at least twice.	3.8836873367679194
A mean of 16 ml collagen was injected.	3.05228341939738
The results were successful directly after injections, leaving all patients continent; however, after 3 months the treatment failed and all patients returned to their incontinence status as seen preoperatively.	3.126769614614255
No perioperative complications were noted.	3.6229551825140844
Despite the simple and safe nature of this procedure, men with severe postoperative stress incontinence do not benefit from periurethral collagen injections.	3.389612796406446
After a short review of the literature, some aspects of the psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania with an adolescent patient are presented that up to now have not been described in great detail.	4.233018316920374
Against the backdrop of previous fears of being abandoned, the patient feels threatened that while coping with the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness she will be dropped once again.	2.9396256558147544
This psychodynamically oriented therapy makes it possible for the patient to accept and verbalize the corresponding feelings in a relationship that gives a feeling of security.	3.3973664589179515
Therefore, the symptoms that previously served the purpose of regulating diffuse inner tensions and fears may be abandoned.	2.8772814938693028
According to sonographic criteria, 55 patients underwent surgical treatment with mobilisation in a lower leg plaster or conservative treatment with early mobilisation in heel pad (3 cm) shoes when an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) was diagnosed.	3.1373420328346286
The follow-up period in 51 patients was 2.4 years (operated group = 28 patients, conservative group = 23 patients) with clinical examination and testing of isokinetic muscle strength in knee joint flexion.	3.3829816595095985
After surgical treatment, minor wound infections occurred in 10.6 %.	3.304224793185774
Reruptures occurred in 13 % of the conservative group.	4.234156434074439
Following conservative treatment, the rate of stress-related achillodynia was significantly higher (P = 0.019).	3.8963710700489744
In the operated group mean isokinetic muscle strength was 13.7 % lower than in the uninvolved leg and decreased significantly with non-operative treatment to 75.3 % (P = 0.012).	3.4337594761380577
We recommend surgical treatment of acute ATR.	4.451478461101719
The indications for conservative treatment depend on the extent of the rupture (measured by ultrasound in the equinus position), the desired level of daily activity and the patient's degree of compliance.	3.9053974048749778
As so many innovations in the field of assisted reproductive technology, however, sex selection raises difficult moral and legal issues.	3.7894689607495247
In this paper, we focus on the question whether or not sex selection calls for a legal ban.	3.210075313283744
Since it does not seem to imply any serious harm to others, we argue in favour of the legalization of sex selection.	3.0487888532791896
Acute limb ischemia is an emergency which regularly requires operative treatment in departments of general surgery.	3.4146182797906794
In about 70 % of cases there is an embolic reason for acute ischemia.	3.694719784272422
In the majority of cases urgent operative desobliteration is required to guarantee limb salvage.	3.0144729892964786
The introduction of balloon catheters reduced the surgical trauma significantly in cases of long secondary thromboses.	3.5964420650270816
The mortality of these emergency operations is still 10-20 % with a limb salvage rate of 80-90 %.	3.375565064254594
Infectious complications related to acquired neutropenia have become a major medical issue, often requiring intensive care management.	3.265819439938919
These infections may be lethal if empirical broad-spectrum treatment is not rapidly started at the first sign of infection (i.e., fever), and this concept is now widely recognized a standard practice.	3.61695917767955
However, the choice of antibiotics has generated considerable controversy for nearly 25 years.	3.043125855682063
After reviewing some particularities of infection in neutropenic patients, this paper will discuss the options and present comprehensive algorithm for non-infectious diseases specialist, including recent advances about early IV-oral switch and the selection of low risk patients for outpatient management.	3.312446804482067
Background: It has been suggested that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS).	3.3050953013631794
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a classic acute phase protein.	3.1797355127170612
It is yet unclear whether, in addition to established markers as troponin T (TnT), determination of CRP in patients admitted for ACS contributes significantly to the diagnosis and prognosis of ACS.Patients and Methods: We investigated 50 patients with ACS (59.4 SD 13.9 years) in the first hour after admission and 4-24h later with respect to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).	3.397050098169722
Fifty percent of the patients were classified as having unstable angina retrospectively.	4.879566063337956
All patients were followed in the 6 weeks post discharge regarding death and recurrent ACS.Results: The cumulative event rate at 6 weeks after discharge was 62.5% for patients being CRP and TnT positive compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.	3.029716357598823
In TnT negative patients a positive CRP test predicted 33.3% of events and 28.8% of patients negative for CRP and TnT had events at 42 days post discharge.	2.8849605923539188
Logistic regression analysis regarding the primary endpoint including TnT and CRP (4-24h values), age, gender and diagnosis resulted in independent prediction of ACS or death by TnT (cutoff 0.1µg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).	3.040947368823878
Sensitivity/specificity for AMI diagnosis were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP 4-24h later.Conclusions: Besides TnT, high sensitivity CRP determination has no additional value for early AMI diagnosis.	2.966962509033834
The prognosis of these patients during the first 24 hours is significantly and independently predicted by CRP measurements in addition to troponin T.	4.031628537145198
Purpose: Evaluation of clinical and morphological results in 44 consecutive patients with 45 aneurysms of the posterior circulation.	4.019123762804958
Following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in 2 to 30% of cases, depending mainly on graft age.	3.622636373454953
Selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation - transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation - depends on various parameters including coronary morphology, left ventricular performance, comorbidity and availability of graft material.	3.1397590727832054
Catheterbased interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible, but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis - compared with native coronary arteries - have to be expected.	3.5929300576428687
Repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality, patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery.	3.632687226670891
We report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a jump-graft supplying RCA, LAD and Cx sequentially, making reintervention necessary.	2.730190459394872
As a prerequisite serial balloon angioplasty of two native vessels was performed prior to ostial intervention.	3.0538957996072087
Intravascular-ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long-term result.	3.819351365096246
Our case demonstrates that, if all relevant clinical parameters and different therapeutic options are taken into account, complex transcatheter angioplasty procedures are feasible and associated with a reasonable amount of risk, thus avoiding repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations.	3.471874939876872
In recent years the indication for a mastectomy for breast cancer has been increasingly restricted.	3.452546638022637
The use of plastic reconstructive techniques enhances the rate of breast-conserving therapy even for large breast tumors with excellent cosmetic results and oncological safety.	3.20562303991304
The breast-to-tumor ratio and locally complete resection with free tumor margins of 1-2 cm are the most important factors in breast-conserving surgery.	4.077182090578096
Different techniques of reduction mammoplasty within the concept of oncological breast surgery not only allow large tumors in large breasts to be resected, but also relatively large tumors in normal sized or even smaller breasts to be resected.	3.3855781219238725
Other advantages are the reduction of breast size and therefore target volume before postoperative radiation procedures as well as in cancer prophylaxis and risk reduction by reducing ipsi- and contralateral breast tissue.	3.494581769044339
Reduction mammoplasty techniques with different resection areas have to be selected for individual tumor locations.	3.711703249121809
The best symmetry is achieved by bilateral mammoplasty in a one step procedure with lumpectomy and axillary dissection.	3.081199647895367
Oncoplastic or reconstructive surgery in the target breast is often followed by procedures to improve symmetry by contralateral reduction.	3.501070515941894
Whenever possible, mammoplasty techniques with minimal scarring should be chosen out of a variety of reduction procedures.	3.6021881511726415
Epidermoid cysts are rare, benign tumors of the testis or, less frequently, the inguinal cord.	4.430901189435992
Generally, they affect males between 10 and 39 years.	3.2422130066434836
In newborns they are rare.	3.5414555023850935
We report on a newborn with an epidermoid cyst of the right testis that had been diagnosed in utero and was removed with preservation of the testicle.	3.4896416789742273
Although there are various published descriptions of the dura mater spinalis [4, 7, 9, 11, 16], some points relating to the texture of the collagen fibres in the dura have still not been adequately explained.	3.352038038875793
In this study the orientation of the collagen fibril bundles was revealed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy, and our observations have yielded new insights into the three-dimensional structure of the human dura mater spinalis.	3.404180706080608
Reconstructive plastic surgery is not always possible or advisable for nasal defects following tumor resections.	3.550459446639293
Facial prostheses offer an alternative therapy.	3.1939812196780766
Since 1991, 37 patients with nasal defects after tumor surgery were treated in the Berlin Center of Facial Prostheses: 28 received "soft" silicone facial prostheses and 9 "solid" polymethylmetacrylate facial prostheses.	3.404565943200285
In 35 patients protheses were bone-anchored: Brånemark implants were used in 12 patients and an Epitec frame construction in 23 patients.	3.2143829450826837
Glue-on prostheses were applied to only two patients.	3.53970311275607
No intraoperative complications occurred at implant insertion.	3.1840036342667357
During following visits only minor inflammations were observed around implants and were treated locally.	3.2111955137880526
The implant success rate was 78% for the Brånemark implants (89.7% in non- radiated areas and 50% in radiated areas) and 100% in radiated and non-radiated areas for the Epitec system.	3.2789415657145113
Our investigation shows that given the right indication, the bone-anchored facial prosthesis is safe, cosmetically acceptable, uncomplicated and not stressful for the patient.	3.1838826518685477
We report a patient who developed malignant transformation of a cellular blue nevus.	2.7525543439059112
At the age of 19 years the congenital, pigmented tumor on the left buttock was histopathologically diagnosed as cellular blue nevus.	3.1937561656580513
Thirty years later the tumor dramatically increased in size, involving the entire left buttock within several months.	3.466824854939556
Multiple biopsies revealed the presence of a cellular blue nevus within the papillary dermis and an invasive, pleomorphic pigmented sarcoma in the depth of the tissue spreading into subcutis and skeletal muscle.	3.2597248342422547
Both benign and malignant cells were S100+, vimentin+ and HMB-45+, but only the malignant tumor cells stained positive for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen.	3.527929594372525
General examination disclosed multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the retroperitoneum as well as a single brain metastasis.	3.8940271087368625
Despite palliative therapy with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, the patient developed generalized metastases and died within weeks.	3.8275682886535876
This case clearly confirms that cellular blue nevi have the potential for malignant transformation and that the malignant variant may behave aggressively just as a malignant melanoma.	3.326449117113713
(Acitve alert) Hypnosis and sports in the psychotherapy of out-patients with anxiety disorders.	3.0106586525832144
A process-oriented approach combining hypnotherapeutic with cognitive-behavioral concepts within a systemic model of psychotherapy for the outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders is outlined.	3.2423292974093676
The use of active alert hypnosis (hypnosis by bicycle ergometry) combining elements of hypnotherapy and sports therapy is adapted to patients characteristics and the process of therapy.	2.8601983754243423
Relaxation and active alert hypnosis and different sports are used as methods of cue exposure respectively training of competence.	3.2420938295726183
The treatment is sequentially structured (motivation, symptom-control, conflict, integration).	2.782560704759871
Active alert hypnosis catalyses the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom-control (reduction of anxiety and depression) and of conflict (modifcation of intrapsychic conficts or traumata within trance induced by physical exercises).	3.104079235974406
Therapeutic goals and techniques for each stage are specified by case examples.	3.1284710652243453
Endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation.	3.6727873119222934
Other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery, not at the site of the pathology.	3.733490230672178
With the transforaminal approach, treatment in the epidural space has become possible.	3.6172060601374327
In a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls, risks, and complications of transforaminal surgery.	3.6036303304007555
Patient satisfaction and acceptance of the method were documented.	4.312738462308515
Some 27 patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space, excluding extremely medially situated herniations, were treated.	3.338092498161545
We used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia.	2.916153280002781
The treated levels were L5/S1 (11), L4/5 (12), L3/4 (3), and L2/3 (1).	4.145086935896185
All areas could be reached by this approach.	3.3974297775605375
One patient had recurrent disk herniation and had an open procedure.	2.9937932160493324
Two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain.	3.034154987727013
No signs of reherniation could be found in these cases, but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring.	4.306912440113624
Minor complications were trancient root paresthesia and headache postoperatively.	2.673122905493954
Postoperative MRI or CT scans revealed only little scar tissue.	3.3560512076259474
This impression was supported in the open revisions we performed.	3.48552591918833
Clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly.	4.1987700000900725
Endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve, even when surgeons are acquainted with the posterolateral approach and arthroskopic surgery.	3.1949156710322892
However, it offers a good alternative to other minimally invasive procedures and has to be seen as a good alternative to open disk surgery, too.	3.7128458107582416
Quality management in a rescue coordination center (RCC) not only needs an evaluation of quantitative parameters (such as time intervals), but also an examination of the correlation between suspected and real found emergency situations.	3.585338247681883
For that purpose it is necessary to request feedback informations about kind and severity of the emergency situation from the emergency medical team working at the scene.	3.544729757103865
The case of a fatal catheter-induced cardiac tamponade in a 81-year-old woman is reported.	2.9087100840085736
Death occurred after a delay of 18 h following placement of a central venous catheter for parenteral feeding.	3.1980036845250512
According to the clinical and histological findings, placement of the catheter caused a primary perforation.	3.6919238978532434
Confirmation of proper placement of the catheter tip was not performed.	3.3053570557904197
Despite clinical indications on the forthcoming complication, sufficient emergency treatment was not carried out.	3.0906220058454505
Background: The rapid integration of new technology into ophthalmologic practice, e. g. LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis), is associated with new complications.	3.388901627328417
The limitations of the new technology cannot be precisely determined.	3.7203160420627013
During lamellar cuts with microkeratomes intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations occur.	2.831571911800908
The IOP elevation during the lamellar cut cannot be determined by conventional tonometry.	3.2132896064631242
Due to its superior soft tissue contrast conventional MRI is the imaging method of  choice in the evaluation of ankle joint disorders.	3.0966468493355546
Conventional MR imaging can accurately demonstrate normal or acutely injured ligaments; however, in subacute and chronic injury joint fluid necessary for delineation of injured ligaments is absent and MR arthrography should be performed.	2.92305050594728
MR arthrography uses the intraarticular injection of contrast material to distend the joint, yielding improved discrimination of intraarticular structures.	3.3110202908586435
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions tracking of contrast material into the interface can be more easily demonstrated.	3.5511144635374743
Finally, high contrast and joint distension by MR arthrography improves the detection of intraarticular loose bodies, which often require surgery.	3.3786408084152892
MR arthrography, although invasive, may provide additional information in various ankle joint disorders.	3.2114119164221515
Several studies have demonstrated an association Chlamydia pneumoniae with coronary artery disease, suggesting that infection with C. pneumoniae increases the risk for coronary artery disease by factor 2 or more.	3.6658345889347395
Since atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory process, these data would fit into the response-to-injury hypothesis of atherosclerosis rather than representing a completely novel concept.	3.733784211628886
Several pathomechanisms as increased cytokine synthesis, proliferative and proaggregatory effects could transmit the effects of chronic C. pneumoniae infection.	3.323313307202887
Animal models and first clinical trials using antibiotic therapy seem to support an etiological role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease.	2.9974473025125183
In this paper the current knowledge of the role of C- pneumoniae in coronary artery disease is reviewed and possible pathomechanisms are discussed.	3.641694504577684
Preeclampsia is a disorder specific to pregnancy which can affect all maternal organs.	3.402105551090201
Cerebral involvement with the occurence of convulsions is the defining factor for eclampsia.	3.1119015407315644
The most prominent signs of cerebral dysfunction include headache, hyperreflexia, visual disturbances, confusion and/or altered state of consciousness.	3.1261519296126337
Intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhage are severe however rare complications of eclampsia.	3.1547912571082217
TCD investigations regularly find vasospasm in all great cerebral arteries.	3.2437772286999156
Reversible hypodense lesions in the white matter on early CT-scans and increased signal intensities on T2-weighted MRT images indicate local edema.	3.281975109917268
The etiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia remains unknown and its current pathophysiology is still hypothetical.	2.9710061501389498
The clinical picture may best be explained by an endothelial dysfunction with increased vascular sensivity to circulating pressure agents as well as by a structural endothelial lesion with fluid loss from the intravascular compartment.	3.1397516890645214
This article reviews the surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability.	3.0155834550797476
The treatment rationale includes exact definition of the instability pattern ("envelope-of-motion" of the tibia) by clinical examination, arthrometry and stress radiography.	3.639123853191479
Exact evaluation of the osseous anatomy is mandatory to identify an eventual varus morphotype.	3.6822322317211875
This osseous variant in combination with posterior/posterolateral instability should be treated by an osteotomy in every case.	3.8518812897367036
The technique of additive osteotomy to correct varus and increase the sagittal tilt of the proximal tibia is described.	3.1219776302545545
Ligament reconstruction in chronic posterior knee instability must address the posterior cruciate ligament and the lateral/posterolateral structures in many cases.	3.5136111489224944
Patellar tendon grafts, quadriceps tendon grafts or hamstrings can be used for posterior cruciate ligament replacement.	3.9485655316389456
Arthroscopic or mini-open techniques may be used for graft placement, direct posterior fixation of the graft via a posterior incision is an option for patellar tendon grafts.	3.7423834676977483
Bousquet's biceps plasty or Clancy's biceps tenodesis may be used for posterolateral stabilization; a biceps tendon strip can also be used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction.	3.367948023152028
Results of surgery are still moderate.	3.4356887823908298
In the author's series of chronic posterior/posterolateral instability, 26 cases were treated with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and biceps tenodesis.	3.8302004065729185
Follow-up at 18 months demonstrated increased stability (mean residual posterior drawer 8 mm at 70  ° and 20 lb force) and improved knee function (33 % IKDC B, 67 % IKDC C).	2.727938923421713
Presently, surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability should be restricted to centers devoted to this problem.	3.679895038900711
This article reviews the current state of consensus reached for the diagnosis of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of conventional histopathological and immunohistochemical methods for inflammatory infiltrates in addition to molecular biological methods for persistence of viral genome in endomyocardial biopsies.	3.17776970710339
Health policy in Germany has in recent years given priority to the self-administration of physicians, sickness funds, and hospital associations.	3.363348275372063
Hence, legal regulations on quality assurance have focused on defining responsibilities and areas of primary importance, while precise processes are being defined by the self-administration.	3.071533473495532
As prices for health care are increasingly restricted by lump sum payments, quality and quality assurance become more important as a factor in competition between health care providers.	3.247772619969129
To support the implementation of quality assurance in the health care system, the German Federal Ministry of Health has funded model-projects, e.g., to support the adaptation of successful strategies of total quality management for health care.	3.9652644569478057
The research field of tissue engineering combines cells biology, biomaterial science, and surgery.	3.2216396760644574
Major long-term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients' own cells.	4.180263341539933
Our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues.	3.4647389438940115
The practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three-dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems.	3.1693756187234574
The tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin, agarose, alginate, hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly -hydroxy acids (PLLA/PGLA).	2.7086703358172026
Different technical approaches were established: a) three-dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b) interacting three-dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations, such as BMP-transfected mesenchymal cells.	3.813954395191482
The preshaped artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre-formation step.	3.0134182188707817
Subsequently, pre-formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into 4mm articular joint defects of rabbits.	2.8688064656112364
Transplants were found to produce cartilage typic morphological patterns and matrix.	3.719274060461043
80% of the transplants remained stable in vivo.	3.0862358349472037
However, 20% of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue.	3.3353212785568993
These results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction.	2.8616713628465678
The treatment of severe joint defects, however, faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies: (a) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints, (b) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation, and (c) the required enormous mechanical stability.	3.6014717673595986
Background: Silicon-rubber central venous catheters have become commonplace in the care of premature infants.	3.275750314869196
We report on a rare complication, fracture and cardiac embolization of a silicone-rubber catheter and its interventional retrieval.	2.94628765513076
The ARO multicenter study intended to show clinical and radiological differences with regard to different systems of fixation and designs of the prothesis in total hip replacement in patients with hip dysplasia, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.	3.864487569274119
In 1987 and 1988 5255 total hip prothesis were implanted by the 24 hospitals which took part in the study.	3.20517303181534
3133 prothesis (95,6 %) were clinically and radiologically examined.	4.097170801832608
The follow-up period averaged 6.9 years.	3.0686552773656812
The results of the Aro multicenter-study showed that despite difficult preoperative conditions especially in cases of rheumatoid arthritis the satisfaction rate improved remarkably.	3.084032843220837
During the operation less complications arose in comparison to patients with hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis.	3.3248246071187206
Regarding the rate of infection after operation there were no differences between the 3 groups.	4.623155973169345
Only the rate of postoperative luxation concerning rheumatoid patients turned out to be twice the number of the others.	4.04896125300031
In our opinion this is due to the fact that these rheumatics were operated by posterior approach.	3.3045884814309803
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were satisfied most with their surgeries.	3.1040285979526376
Results of rheumatic patients according to Harris hip score were slightly worse than the results of the two other groups.	3.8493350434913736
This was due to systemic involvement and bad preoperative function of the hip.	3.7339207073895317
As a result of the study there were no differences in using cemented or cementless techniques for rheumatic hip replacement.	3.3652439433323216
The decision for the method of fixation should depend on the patient's ability to relief the prothesis after operation.	3.6278354405804234
The study has shown that cementless implantation can also be used for young rheumatics provided that a suitable design of prothesis will be selected.	3.1028538855760224
Sepsis developing on the basis of a postoperative infection is a rare, but life-threatening event.	4.015988733840809
Early diagnosis of postoperative complications usually facilitates decisive intervention and a favorable prognosis.	3.242547424631656
If the right moment is missed, endothelial damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and generalized systemic infection (SIRS).	3.3843735810636453
For the subsequentially developing septic shock, often combined with multiple organ failure (MOF), it is not important whether the starting point was an uncontrollable infections focus, ischemic damage following hypovolemic shock, or massive bacterial translocation with postoperative bowel obstruction.	2.96069146733629
The collapse of the immune system results in immune paralysis and explains the inability of the organism to defend itself against systemic infections.	3.092964563628675
For early recognition of the developing septic complication and its effective treatment, pathophysiological and clinical issues are discussed.	3.0735823049711373
The comparison of prediction of mortality and sepsis by different score systems was the objective of this retrospective study in 51 patients.	3.369817774675818
Specific scores for burned patients - "Abbreviated Burn Severity Index" (ABSI) and the "Baltimore Sepsis Scale" (BSS) were compared with the general intensive score systems: "Mortality Prediction Model" (MPM II), "Simplified Acute Physiology Score" (SAPS II), APACHE II (ApII), "Hannover Intensive Score" (HIS) and the sepsis score developed by Elebute and Stoner (ES).	3.045709911788043
On days 1 and 3 the true-positive ratio (sensitivity) was plotted against false-positive ratio (1-specifity) for each score.	3.536688128140204
The area under the curve (max.	2.893941473614875
0.5) correlates with the quality of the score system.	4.739372153222354
We also tested the discrimination of septic and nonseptic patients by using the different scores.	3.471548657209065
Bilateral symmetric changes in the cerebral hemispheric white matter are found with increasing frequency using CT and MRI techniques.	3.742645892515178
These unspecific canges of the white matter signal are often called leukoaraiosis.	3.202578076549837
They differ from the normal white matter signal.	3.0397424205751475
These changes are found with increasing frequency in persons older than 60 years and also patients with dementia and cerebrovascular diseases.	3.0466311105525183
The pathogenesis, clinical significance and morphological substrate are unclear.	3.1121936529789664
The aim of this review is to summarise the actual knowledge about the etiology and clinical signs and symptoms found in patients with leukoaraiosis.	3.9737702985719836
This term should not be used when white matter changes are found in patients younger than 35 years, with an unilateral onset, asymmetric distribution, and extensive changes all over the infra- and supratentorial white matter area.	3.477793883602605
Neuroradiological and clinical criteria are given to differentiate between leukoaraiosis and diseases of the white matter, especially enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, lacunar infarction, subcortical arteriosclerotic angiopathy (Binswanger's disease), leukoencephalopathy of different origin, and demyelinating diseases.	3.178532075312911
A case with various skeletal abnormalities, soft tissue masses and skin lesions diagnosed as Proteus syndrome is reported.	3.0138718464137195
Proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders, because of the polymorphous nature of its clinical manifestations.	3.773288850455479
It is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems.	4.4738856256027715
Early diagnosis and careful follow-up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long-term complications.	3.897764321649688
The value of elective PTA in stenoses of the supraaortic vessels and especially of the carotid artery is still under discussion.	3.279907407855261
Stenoses after surgical and/or radiation therapy and a high cardio-vascular risk for a surgical procedure, however, justify minimal-invasive techniques.	4.684747585789398
Profiles of fundamental frequency sound pressure levels and voice duration are measured separately in clinical practice.	3.3227832380095816
It was the aim of the present study to combine the two examinations, in order to estimate the relationship between pitch, sound pressure level and voice duration and to develop a new computer-assisted graph.	3.5998121342660143
A three-dimensional (3D) wireframe phonogram was constructed based on SPL profiles to obtain a general view of the parameters recorded.	3.1564913512248705
We have termed this "phonetography".	3.0544724070998948
The results in 21 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with hyperfunctional dysphonias demonstrated that there were three typical figures of the 3D phonograms produced, depending on the relationship between voice duration when soft ("piano") compared to loud ("forte").	3.1268044257134813
In one-third of the healthy volunteers, the values of the piano voice duration were greater than those of forte for almost all pitches examined.	3.486296415821987
In two-thirds of the healthy subjects the values of forte voice duration were partly greater, as were those of piano voice duration.	3.065575493825151
All of the patients showed voice duration values greater for forte than for piano.	3.421625922830591
The results of the study demonstrate that the 3D phonogram is a useful tool for obtaining new insights into various relationships of voice parameters.	3.2672707974113453
Sinus histiocytosis is as a rule a benign disease of lymph nodes, infiltrated by large histiocytes.	3.9691001655447353
These cells show typical cytophagocytosis, particularly lymphophagocytosis.	3.099996358024183
Other organs may be also involved by this disease, often including the skin.	3.34328757952204
Exclusive cutaneous sinus histiocytosis without infiltration of lymph nodes seems to be very rare.	4.349430887355578
To exclude other non-X histiocytoses or histiocytosis-X, it is advisable to use immunohistochemistry.	3.6079955185710495
We report on a patient with sinus histiocytosis and discuss the problems of differential diagnosis.	3.0503187613837346
The case of a five-year-old girl with intractable fluor vaginalis and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported.	3.034633823943364
A presacral dermoid cyst was shown to be the cause of these symptoms.	3.9645433902774965
Extensive radiological investigation revealed the cyst and the associated fistulas extending into the perianal region and the vagina.	3.2425432348243945
After verification of the anatomical situation, an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out.	4.004024478909075
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive functional method for the study of solid tumor perfusion, metabolism and interaction with different therapeutic agents.	3.743749009256832
The aim of the study was the investigation of the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and the kinetics during a treatment with intratumoral ethanol by PET.	3.1405334175373922
The ongoing study includes seven patients with child A cirrhosis and HCC (UICC stage III-IVA; tumor size 3-6 cm).	3.172744085106468
Dynamic PET studies (60 min) with 18F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) were performed prior to therapy to assess tumor viability.	3.356880218958698
The evaluation of the FDG data demonstrated a liver-equivalent uptake in six of the tumors (well and moderately differentiated HCC), which were poorly delineated against the normal liver parenchyma.	3.719258312100332
One moderately differentiated HCC showed an increased FDG metabolism, indicating no correlation between histology and metabolism.	3.4264051698051
A dose of 37-80 MBq 11C-ethanol was applied together with a nonlabelled therapeutic dose of the drug via a puncture needle positioned under sonography.	3.3097321505497694
Five out of seven tumors demonstrated a high 11C uptake shortly after the end of the ethanol injection followed by constant 11C-ethanol concentration during the whole study period of 45 min.	3.1760735186020614
The PET data demonstrated no significant elimination of the 11C-ethanol from the tumor and no accumulation in the surrounding liver tissue.	3.552681411902891
One case showed a decrease of the intratumoral 11C-ethanol concentration due to a punkture of a tumor vein, and in another case the surrounding liver parenchyma demonstrated significant 11C uptake in the early phase following paratumoral injection of the drug.	3.7691281483516343
In conclusion, PET is a useful tool for the study of the mechanism and the kinetics of percutaneous intratumoral ethanol injection of HCC.	3.5258470434381386
During the last decade, many investigations were conducted in order to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	3.3231977803695996
However, the increasing knowledge, instead of clarification, leads us to realize that these terms may assemble a wide variety of lung pathologies.	2.7473750029594393
Indeed, many circumstances can result in these syndromes and no particular factor has been defined to distinguish ARDS of one etiology from another.	3.298073332223901
We are still ignorant about which factors lead to the extended inflammation from pneumonia to ARDS, while it is not clear whether the timing of events are determined by some mediators.	3.4615169761469673
Furthermore, in the clinical arena, there is no clear distinction between pneumonia, severe pneumonia which may lead to ALI and then ARDS.	4.1015726370023815
This review is an analysis by an ICU clinician of the different points of view of these syndromes and intends to give a global vision of the numerous factors implied, emphasizing the complex interactions between them.	3.3281856152562246
The present state about new potential treatments directed on mediators is summarized.	2.7813248890335434
The aim of the study was to evaluate if a combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS = Marburger Intensive Score) offers better outcome prediction compared to scoring systems, which are based either only physiologically (APACHE II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) or only therapeutically (TISS = Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) in medical intensive care medicine.	2.7410314884688973
Main outcome parameters employed were hospital mortality, severity of disease classification and length of hospital stay.	3.3589001175257684
During a 12-months period (1993/94), 531 consecutive patients (ICU stay >4 hours) being admitted to a medical ICU of a tertiary care university hospital were prospectively investigated.	3.309520415124533
The day-1-scores of MARIS, APACHE II, and TISS were determined and the patients were followed until hospital discharge or death.	4.1725279219145985
There was no advantage in using the combined scoring system (MARIS) neither in discrimination between survival and non-survival (hospital mortality; areas under the ROC-curve: MARIS = 0.84, APACHE II = 0.86, TISS = 0.78) nor in severity classification (relationship between day-1-scores and hospital mortality: p<0.001 (chi2-Test) in all three systems).	2.8785614868160856
In contrast only for the combined system (MARIS), a dependence of length of hospital stay from day-1-scores in the analysis of survivors only and in the analysis of all patients (survivors and non-survivors) (p<0.001; ANOVA) could be demonstrated.	4.452443908523963
In conclusion the combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS) did not offer a better outcome prediction concerning hospital mortality and severity classification compared to the established systems in critically ill patients.	2.92823558344906
Its use may be advantageous in evaluating the relationship between day-1-scores and length of hospital stay, which for economical reasons has become a parameter of growing interest in intensive care medicine.	3.248020191546588
A 23 month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia, mainly truncal rash and unclear pain.	2.9336411406008214
Previously he had shown fever, conjunctivitis and desquamations of hands and feet.	2.950034642173815
Laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and an elevation of ESR and gamma-globulins.	3.1431580732135016
No bacterial infection was found.	3.6057218768396795
The ECG showed signs of a myocardial ischemia.	3.634163163613549
The sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery.	4.765525834108572
The boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest.	3.2532067712368544
The autopsy verified the diagnosis of Kawasaki-syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis.	3.415218691590286
The etiology of the painful hip in children is widespread.	3.296685915975775
In this paper, predominants cases without previous trauma are discussed in detail.	2.7986086441770563
Depending on age, history, clinical picture and laboratory results, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is presented, which should avoid unnecessary tests and lead to the necessary therapeutic measure.	3.8104240882656493
Several common as well as uncommon clinical entities are illustrated by representative examples.	3.862344946607529
The present study exemplifies the method of quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) by quantifying, in bovine tissues, the specific mRNAs for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) -receptor and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.	2.957610408404329
Our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mRNAs.	3.1603395269519825
The LDL-receptor mRNA expression was highest in the adrenal gland (6.7 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the corpus luteum of the ovary, intermediate in the liver (8.6 x 102 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and not detectable in the large intestine.	2.5938837161395236
It was found to be highest in the ovary (6.1 x 106 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the adrenal gland, intermediate in the liver (3.1 x 105 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and lowest in the large intestine (9.9 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA).	2.4989449272057342
These data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches.	3.362093060581758
Thus cRT-PCR is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the LDL-receptor and the HMG-CoA reductase.	3.462745291627923
Spinal opioids are effective analgesics for surgical and non-surgical pain.	3.7961209141214782
Central and systemic side effects are less frequent than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioids.	3.7956748855127107
This review focuses on the analgesic efficacy of spinal opioids and their combination with local anaesthetics for postoperative analgesia, including patient-controlled epidural analgesia.	3.3652677455704763
Intrathecal administration of opioids has some advantages over their administration by the epidural route.	3.3631347118145993
Several factors may influence selection of the opioid; however, in most situations morphine is the drug of choice.	3.5841441861975687
Thoracic epidural administration of opioids seems to have no clinically important advantages over the lumbar route in terms of quality of analgesia, adverse effects, doses required or pulmonary function.	3.9533089846524487
However, evidence suggesting that effective postoperative analgesia can significantly improve postoperative morbidity in patients at risk is accumulating.	3.4160730556073453
In such patients, combined use of epidural local anaesthetics and opioids may become the technique of choice for postoperative analgesia.	3.8260147039349093
However, there is no evidence that this would have any clinically relevant benefit in low-risk patients.	3.2026563346092916
This contribution summarizes a discussion of several experts on the field of clinical nutrition, which was held in Evangelische Akademie Loccum, Germany, May 20-21, 1998.	3.65835639094252
Nutrition can be considered a medical treatment, which justifies assessment of benefits according to outcome parameters.	3.67560043272059
With regard to nutritional support of the cancer patient, evaluation of quality of life (QL) is more appropriate than morbidity and survival related parameters.	3.343121937078433
Quality of life is a multidimensional construct which can be measured by standardized questionnaires.	3.10953805677677
The QL Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), is an established and validated instrument which provides reliable information with regard to disease-related limitations of QL.	3.8816541536780056
The measurement of QL can be extended by appropriate modules for specific problems according to the underlying cancer disease and special therapies (e.g., percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy).	3.053394668836201
In the individual case, the interpretation of the role of nutritional parameters for QL may be confounded by other parameters, such as disease or personal changes.	4.112026060221927
However, the information supports decision making about the indication, the route of nutritional therapy, as well as individual follow-up.	3.502360584410353
Using QL as an outcome parameter, carefully designed prospective trials might be feasible in order to investigate the outcome of nutritional therapy in patients with advanced cancer.	4.477210593609577
The inclusion of a control group is questionable from the ethical viewpoint.	3.6406481657695218
The treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative.	4.009670478276475
The immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments, with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist.	3.593929027468946
A graduated treatment scheme based on the ASIF classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur.	4.334148699397718
The majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means; operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement.	3.338767977777989
The authors' own patient population is presented in this paper: in these patients fixation with Kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used, followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty, and for C-type fractures according to the ASIF classification or when there is severe soft-tissue damage, application of a fixateur externe spanning the joint has proved best.	3.937360423004751
Treatment strategy, risks, complications and results are presented.	3.9403113927296363
Many couples have to cope with periods of involuntary childlessness and they often ask for medical help.	3.0410357114358666
In the Heidelberg Project of involuntary childlessness in men, andrological patients were surveyed from the time before diagnosis till the end of 1 year's andrological treatment.	3.1001906012430114
Cardiac complications remain an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality with noncardiac surgery, despite improvement in surgical techniques and anaesthetic management.	3.4699528381718387
Therefore preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment plays a pivotal role in management of patients prior to noncardiac surgery.	2.98700503566894
Thorough history-taking and careful examination are essential to consider further diagnostic steps in order to predict the patient's individual perioperative cardiac risk as accurately as possible.	3.571036382897542
Besides elaboration of medical therapy, cardiac catherization and even balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery must be considered if indicated by preoperative cardiac testing.	3.4491443497632543
The etiology of the instability are ligamentous damage and functional neuromuscular disorder of the peroneal muscles.	3.453956814863752
The standards of diagnostics are the history with the frequency of inversion trauma per period and the interval from the primary trauma, the clinical examination and radiological stress tests.	4.3215956680622725
Newer diagnostic methods, up to now not well established in clinical routine, include stabilometry, cybex-measurements of the pronator muscles, the evaluation of peroneal reaction time on a tilting platform and dynamic pedography.	3.5213915502957622
Conservative management of chronic ankle instability consists of wearing ankle braces and rehabilitation programs concerned with peroneal muscle strengthening and coordination training.	2.8499864491528935
The indication for surgical reconstruction of the ankle ligaments are a well-documented mechanical instability with the neuromuscular reflexes intact and a failed physiotherapeutic training program.	3.672519486345457
The surgical procedure should be selected according to a priority list: 1. anatomical repair, eventually augmented with periosteum from the fibula, 2.	3.1543831443298105
Watson-Jones tenodesis, and 3.	3.9886032336584063
Chrisman-Snook tenodesis to treat a concomittant subtalar instability.	3.070744813665526
No other disease has exhibited such a significant influence on the behaviour of health care workers (HCW) as the AIDS pandemic.	3.3256041946684136
Numerous epidemiological data, however, have proven that the overall risk of transmission of the human deficiency virus (HIV) during surgical interventions is low; it is 0.3 % for all types of percutaneous exposures.	3.554923419948486
Nevertheless, there still is a need for wider adoption of safer surgical techniques to reduce the chances of HIV transmission in the operation theatre, which additionally minimize the risk of transmission of other blood-borne pathogens.	3.599698673119979
In the case of occupational exposure to HIV-contaminated blood or body secretions post-exposure prophylaxis should be recommended stratified by the type of exposure and source material.	3.0901265333560777
Abstract   Pachyonychia congenita (PC) comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited conditions showing characteristic nail thickening and associated signs such as palmoplantar keratoderma, follicular keratoses, and mucosal leukokeratoses.	2.6456369409075102
Less frequently epidermal cysts, hairshaft abnormalities, natal teeth and laryngeal involvement may be seen.	2.9394062838393546
Both conditions show nail deformities, focal palmoplantar keratoderma, and follicular hyperkeratoses.	3.0481920788002808
Diagnostically relevant are leukokeratoses of the oral mucosa in patients with PC type I.	4.140875679569637
In contrast individuals affected with PC type II show premature dentition and multiple pilosebaceous cysts predominantely affecting the upper trunk.	2.738741293194761
The latter closely resemble eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex.	2.7051599832113244
By mutational analysis keratin K6a and K16 gene mutations have been detected in patients with PC type I, and keratin K6b and K17 gene mutations have been shown to be the underlying genetic defect in patients with PC type II.	3.519880742606387
We investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding, administration of blood products, and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem (DIL) administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective CABG.	3.700707412012283
We retrospectively analyzed the surgical and ICU records of CABG patients who had recieved DIL (27 pats.)	3.058876031211404
or nitroglycerin (NTG; 26 pats.)	2.9865052157772145
or a combination thereof (COM; 25 pats.).	3.0615413150421693
Data investigated included the amount of postoperative chest tube bleeding (CTB), frequency of administration of packed red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and changes in hemoglobin (Hb), thrombocyte (Th) levels as well as changes in prothrombin- (PT) and partial thromboplastine time (PTT).	3.353654581258194
There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to biometrical or operative data.	3.2895455180020106
The amount of CTB as well as the use of RBC and FFP were not significantly different between the groups.	3.764509695066486
Also, there were no significant differences with regard to Hb or Th and PT or PTT, both in the early phase after the operation in ICU as well as after 24 hours in the ICU.	4.097561707056822
The perioperative administration of the calcium entery blocker DIL reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during CABG surgery.	3.4774805916892344
This administration during CABG surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding.	3.75264032066862
As compared to NTG, DIL does not have negative effects on Hb and Th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first 24 hours in the ICU after CABG surgery.	3.2482628231562396
Depression and fibromyalgia (FM) share common symptoms, indicating a close relationship between both disorders.	2.9013386058664756
FM patients frequently present symptoms of major depression.	3.6277721558640015
Genetic epidemiological studies show that genetic transmission is one important component.	3.5322030932447817
Molecular genetic studies are on the way; the serotonin transporter promoter gene seems to be associated with neurotic anxiety and FM.	3.4037981883242847
Biochemical studies related to the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are disturbed in both disorders.	3.416994717492696
This view is supported by the response to treatment with antidepressants.	3.8399607103999513
At our hospital, closed dislocations of the elbow without neurovascular or osseous lesion are treated conservatively after successful reduction in the absence of a tendency to redislocation.	3.860683722517007
Indications for surgery are irreducible dislocations and those with a tendency to redislocation as well as open soft tissue injuries, neurovascular and osseous concomitant injuries.	3.7133226606180516
During a period of 10 years 113 patients were treated according to this strategy.	3.575732253377496
Of these patients, 46 had simple dislocations of the elbow and 67 suffered from dislocations with osseous lesions.	2.9131145727715606
In 95 patients follow-ups could be performed after a mean period of 55 months.	3.561123254690988
Nearly all of the patients had a stable elbow joint at the end of therapy.	4.679362987656005
The present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding (PET) in the conjunctivae and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation.	3.3734784490370773
In a series of 473 autopsies the over all occurrence of PET was 13.3%.	2.8770479991440587
The highest frequencies were found in fire victims (31%), persons who had died after intensive care (24%), cardiac death (22%), drowning and intoxication (16% each).	3.3633160895109815
At first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) seemed to influence the occurrence of PET, because the rate was 11% without and 19% with CPR (x2: p < 0.05); an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature.	3.3831776111043297
However, further analysis showed that a higher rate of PET could only be observed in causes of death where PET are often fround irrespective of CPR, whereas in the other groups PET (with or without CPR) are uncommon.	3.8864512229433057
Furthermore, a case-by-case analysis showed that in several cases with PET after CPR the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than CPR.	3.473992352406984
In a second series of autopsy cases with only cardiac deaths (181 cases), the influence of age and body mass on the rate of PET was statistically significant and there was a tendency for more frequent PET with increasing heart weight.	4.018190115571487
On the other hand, no statistically significant influence of CPR on the rate of PET could be found in this relatively homogeneous group.	3.3333646808148636
Media reports convey the impression that the incidence of fatal accidents in the European Alps has been increasing yearly at an alarming rate.	3.4390683716790478
Although objective data is lacking, the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in Germany, Austria, the southern Tirol, Switzerland and the Chamonix region in France were analysed with respect to the fatal and non-fatal accidents which occurred between 1987 and 1997.	3.4338768624161276
Because of varying definitions of "mountain accident" used in these countries, available data about the number of fatalities are not comparable.	3.4946963712214223
Clinically, the tumors were nontender and semimobile.	2.8760845259014225
MR imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs.	3.0555641750660696
At surgery, the tumors were thought to be malignant, most likely liposarcomas.	3.8575662948522016
The histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers.	3.076787016165713
Elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft-tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women.	3.3913037258736995
In 10 % of the patients bilateral, often asynchronous tumors are seen.	4.319049722842642
Ninety-nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region.	3.695148915535892
Occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities, head, and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities.	5.272221343653305
The relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies.	3.4438762161608665
Only case reports of one or more patients exist.	4.136023778613139
Optimal therapy, therefore, remains controversial, and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given.	3.5977226228319537
Nevertheless, in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred, if no contraindications exist.	3.3704554426001034
Two cases are presented together with a literature review.	3.468194769735945
The Comèl-Netherton syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease.	3.5299912417732786
A 23-year old female presented with the classical triad of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, trichorrhexis invaginata with bamboo hairs of up to 12 cm length and atopic diathesis.	3.143131297232459
Nevertheless, more than 20 years passed before the final diagnosis was established.	3.6753553688393854
In addition, the patient was slightly mentally retarded and suffered from a genital papillomatosis, minimal hypergammaglobulinaemia and a marked bilateral eyelid ectropion, more severe than previously reported.	3.2571699780148173
Oral therapy with Acitretin was quite successful.	3.252989413177742
Background: Recent studies have shown the usefulness of pars plana vitrectomy with the use of growth factors in the treatment of macular holes.	4.518907650170956
Autologous platelet concentrates contain many growth factors to stimulate glial wound healing.	2.9411824622865965
In vitro fertilisation IVF and intrazytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction.	3.0064131387124187
Whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted, for example severe tubal damage which cannot be microsurgically repaired, cryptozoospermia, severe OAT syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal IVF, ICSI might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well.	3.0836226336914523
In this paper a number of additional ICSI indications are defined, for example minor forms of andrological subfertility, reinsemination of nonfertilised oocytes on the day after conventional IVF, reduced motility of cryopreserved sperms, reduced quality of oocytes or ICSI after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in IVF.	2.967366646671908
Load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation.	3.669758958579404
The loading which can primarily be influenced are impact situations and friction as well as the stability of the foot.	3.41521334232795
This stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury.	4.174181441434271
However, a certain amount of loading is necessary to improve strength and structure of biological materials.	3.3138387678963572
In the past, the development of shoe and surface materials has hardly been perceived under this aspect, but may be increasingly important in the future.	3.381038396965979
With optimal clinical management of patients with Marfan syndrome, life expectancy may be improved substantially from 32 years to a nearly normal life span.	3.855672377860355
Cornerstones of clinical management comprise genetic counseling, life-style management, and cardiovascular surveillance, which includes regular aortic imaging and endocarditis prophylaxis.	3.3570028633677342
Prophylactic use of beta-blocking agents as well as timing of elective surgery and the choice of the optimal surgical technique are difficult issues that obviously need to be individualized.	4.060957808163334
Juvenile or postoperative patients as well as pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome pose particular problems.	3.915701458701893
This review intends both to facilitate differential decision making based on referenced evidence and to provide guidelines for therapeutic strategies.	2.9833756268002607
Finally, a review of the most recent advantages to somatic gene therapy is given.	4.215901539993001
In different animal investigations Pyrost demonstrated osteoconductive and osteostimulative effects.	2.7511380665540695
In ectopic tissues and especially in conditions of low osteogenetic potency, the combination of Pyrost and autogenic bone marrow effects bone formation.	3.266528595189663
In Germany, good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed.	3.075746238322625
Good supranational industry-sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new (expensive) drugs.	2.9879942118167704
The preconditions for co-operation in conducting industry-independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community have been improved substantially in Germany by instituting the working group of co-operating arthritis centers, the so-called core documentation where 32000 patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in 1997 and the institution of a sophisticated information system ("RheumaNet").	3.214504645030761
The executive board of the German Rheumatology Association has set up an "ad hoc commission" that agreed to institute a "Committee for the Coordination of Clinical Studies in Rheumatic Diseases".	2.721485029870718
In this committee rheumatologists subspecialized from medicine, orthopedic, pediatrics working in universities, hospitals and private practice as well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented.	3.155737936763599
In principle this committee is independent of the co-operating arthritis centers and the RheumaNet.	3.0742802443532646
All members of the German Rheumatology Association are invited to cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important questions and participating in clinical studies.	3.1509894832292544
The committee has to define key questions in rheumatology and shall plan and organize multicenter studies to answer these questions.	2.9479270895644136
In addition, study protocols of pharmaceutical companies may be examined as to their importance, quality, and feasibility.	3.082244706502787
Abnormal uterine bleeding is a gynecological problem frequently seen in women from adolescence to the postmenopausal period.	3.1760139987858462
Nearly 70% of patients' visits to the gynecologist in the peri- and postmenopausal period are due to abnormal uterine bleeding.	3.463390880826693
According to the "speed"-hypothesis of cognitive development, the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence.	3.069918089550446
The present study investigates the "speed"-hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using Latent Growth Curve Methodology.	2.801403236002476
Date on 4 measurement points come from the Bonn Longitudinal Study of aging (N=128, mean age 67.2, 53% women).	3.06480913574883
Based on principal factor analysis, markers of mental speed were the WAIS Digit Symbol Test and simple psychomotor task.	2.82865789399845
As indicators of fluid intelligence the WAIS Object Assembly and Block Design were used.	2.9402853839583676
After separately fitting Latent Growth Curve Models for the trajectory of mental speed and fluid intelligence, a combined model showed no statistically significant improvement of fit for freeing the covariance between the two slope-factors.	3.189238545618485
Interpreting this result, contrary to the "speed"-hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed.	3.0680863566699337
For patients with dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the prognosis is highly unfavorable, even under conditions of optimal medication.	3.4053979016784557
Since there is increasing evidence that modifications of the immune system accompanied by the production of autoantibodies, e.g., against 1 ad-renergic or muscarinergic receptors, are involved in the pathogenesis of DCM, the elucidation of the possible functional significance of these autoantibodies has attracted increasing interest.	3.2720696545433414
In addition to the role of autoantibodies as markers for an autoimmune process, discussion of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms has centered on direct toxicity as well as on negative influencing of myocardial contractility and energy metabolism.	3.513288031900017
The effects gained through removal of autoantibodies by immunoadsorption therapy for DCM patients sheds light on the functional importance of autoantibodies in this syndrome.	2.9811400499776184
A pilot study conducted among DCM patients disclosed that immunadsorption took place in simultaneous conjunction with a reduction in the immunoglobulin level and with significant hemodynamic and clinical improvement.	3.2265397058987046
These results may be interpreted as indicating that autoantibodies play an active role in DCM and that their removal by immunadsorption possibly represents a highly promising future therapeutic concept.	2.9048214365158245
Active unspecific immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting has been shown to enhance survival in melanoma patients, and gene therapy now offers new perspectives for active specific immunotherapy.	3.5020488627690423
Gene therapy includes the transfer of genetic material performed by either viral or non-viral methods and in vivo or ex vivo.	3.4592274939162477
For melanoma the following approaches are suggested: vaccination with tumour-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or `naked DNA', vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T-lymphocytes or transfected tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma.	2.798058354528356
Since 1995, a total of 115 patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment.	3.3967668097803294
After the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment.	3.723980395823697
The mean follow-up period for all patients was 31 months (range 3-50 months.	3.567569307877667
In 87 cases (75.7%) bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms.	3.5031487953349605
Apart from low-grade local reactions (swelling, haematoma, petechiae) no complications were observed.	3.2166341278333475
The treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology.	3.152022922566782
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing.	3.899486787816273
The sound transmission properties of three different commercially available middle ear implants and the prototype of a complete middle ear prosthesis (CoMEP) were evaluated with a special measurement system that permits standardized conditions.	3.4408027505220167
This system uses a mechanical middle ear model (MMM) which approximates the impedances of the tympanic membrane and inner ear.	2.7187096782425475
The implants were fitted under defined conditions into the MMM.	3.273725692361651
Displacement of the artificial stapes footplate of the MMM was measured with an optical probe.	3.4901747792546884
The measurements of different middle ear prostheses showed that the mass of the implant was the most important factor for optimum high frequency transmission.	4.245649439919285
The lightest implant (4 mg, titanium) showed the best results.	3.592384854295286
The CoMEP revealed the highest sensitivity because of a slight enlargement of the diameter of the artificial tympanic membrane.	3.8335981489376443
These findings show that the CoMEP is able to restore sound transmission to a normal range.	3.5383159322380644
In a second experiment one of the implants was fitted into the MMM with different forces.	3.6816778663991534
The increase of stiffness produced a slightly better high frequency transmission at the expense of low frequency sensitivity.	3.1212301646159006
Hence, the fitting of the implant may not be too stiff because of its loss of mobility within a significant frequency range.	3.460085116429832
Angiomyolipomas are hamartomas that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis (M. Bourneville-Pringle).	3.2452011170365984
Clinically, this long-term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass.	3.745608165427475
In view of two of our own case reports, the therapeutic strategies are discussed, paying regard to the actual literature in this field.	4.721037471046042
The excact pathogenesis of Peyronie's Disease (PD) is still unknown.	3.1135339805050397
Histopathological investigations suggest, that the metabolism of the collogenious tissue plays an important role.	3.5466109220102897
Therefore, we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of 11 patients with PD and 11 healthy controls.	4.088930170383224
We mesured biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood, wich correspond to the collagen metabolism (procollagen III [P III P], PMN-elastase [PMN-E], fibronectin [FN], fibronectinreceptor [FN-R] und -1-proteinase-inhibitor [-1-PI]).	2.9344250465372514
There was no difference in PMN-E, P III P, FN and FN-R in all samples.	2.534223488449718
There was no difference in penile and venous blood as well.	2.780169291633409
But we found out a highly significant lower concentration of -1-PI in patients with PD (158,55 mg/dl) than in controls (214,82 mg/dl).	4.207140907121611
Closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare.	3.8139475090945076
Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature, perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor.	4.077175858892896
Most often the rupture occurs as a consequence of a sudden plantar flexion of the ankle and pre-existing degenerative changes of the tendon tissue due to systemic disease or iatrogenic local corticoid injections.	3.870375986314908
Differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded.	3.22828780219606
During the clinical examination the distal stump and the discontinuity of the anterior tibial tendon are often palpable.	3.4065943231121554
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination.	3.0474428441342507
An operation may be undertaken up to 3 months after the injury.	3.483395509022453
Preferred procedures are end-to-end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon, followed by a plaster cast for 6 weeks postoperatively.	3.8905316838761252
High-risk patients can be treated conservatively, but the functional results are less satisfactory.	4.993339976586454
We describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon.	3.9262305764905387
A yet unpublished method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented.	3.3182410350604252
In this four-part review article, an update of Psychological Gerontology since 1988 in German speaking countries is given.	2.8871100603758375
In accordance with their current relevance within research on personality development, concepts and empirical studies concerned with coping, psychological resilience and development regulation in old age are addressed in the first part of this review (contributions to basic research).	3.1052919913502612
First, research based on the two-process-model of coping, the personality theory of Thomae and the life-span theory of control is summarized.	3.6314278333433925
Next, work on subjective well-being, self and self-regulation are highlighted.	3.425304404624222
In the second part of the review (contribution to applied research), an overview of the scope of potential of psychotherapeutic intervention in old age is given.	3.5355597990159775
Background: According to literature, 30-60 % of pacemaker patients suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).	3.6219246079646448
As rapid tracking of PAF may cause severe symptoms in patients with dual chamber pacemakers, refined algorithms providing AV synchronous pacing during periods of sinus rhythm and preventing high ventricular rates during PAF are highly desirable.	3.308965359196269
Aim and method: This comprehensive paper introduces a new mode switching (MS) algorithm which uses either a fixed (Inos2CLS) or programmable (Logos) number of short intervals out of 8 consecutive atrial intervals to detect PAF.	2.79295442865751
If the MS criterion is fulfilled, a switch from AV synchronous pacing to nontracking mode is automatically performed.	2.791975714204066
The algorithm is described together with a discussion on optimization of the programming of parameters which may indirectly influence the MS sensitivity and specificity.	3.250157066022628
Results: This MS concept maintains the high sensitivity and fast reactivity towards PAF of the "mode conversion" in Actros and Kairos pacemaker systems, preventing a long time delay between onset of PAF, detection of the arrhythmia, and switch to nontracking mode.	3.2360304398818975
In addition, adequeate sensing and short blanking periods in the new MS concept enable reliable MS.	2.7774694591769804
The occurrence of atrial oversensing should be tested, as it may lead to inappropriate MS. Programmability of the MS algorithm may be advantageous for individual programming with respect to the patients' arrhythmia rate and atrial sensing performance, but the use of very restrictive or very liberal criteria should be avoided as both may lead to mode oscillations.	3.902350986701214
Finally, examples of stored diagnostic data are presented to assess MS reliability, identify possible problems, and optimize MS function during follow-up.	3.138652761872516
Purpose: To evaluate MR imaging at 1.5 Tesla in patients suffering from acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using proton-density weighted (PDW) fast spin echo (FSE) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences.	2.622475750696373
A number of infectious agents has been newly detected in the last 10 years.	3.4506557766869967
Climatic hanges and migration have been the most important factors in the emergence of new and old infections.	3.9528933714604735
Additionally, new methods for the detection of DNA and RNA have played an important role in the detection of agents difficult to culture.	3.8377593076481156
So far medical requirements for aviators have been defined by national licensing authorities.	2.9886689482281423
For a long while ophthalmological problems, insufficiencies in vision, refraction or color vision, have been responsible for approximately 50 % of rejection of applicants for medical reasons.	2.88870195438295
Introduction: Coronary arterty disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world.	3.727309737917812
Although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography (SCA) is beyond dispute, the associated risk of an invasive approach, the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non-invasive techniques for coronary imaging.	3.7501522485426566
We report nine case histories of patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for severe somatic disorders.	3.280937870087364
The somatic disease was either the cause of the psychiatric symptomatology, or it occurred in addition to a well-known psychiatric disorder.	4.1606995690368995
For general practitioners and psychiatrists it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms due to psychiatric disorders and symptoms that indicate somatic disorders.	3.5160352383478264
If patients refuse the necessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and show behaviour that is not related to good health, there is increased risk for complications and increased morbidity.	4.087100778897707
Penetrating neck injuries are potentially life-threatening injuries.	3.569503383546972
Management is controversial despite decades of discussion in the literature.	3.0845120799718893
An algorithm for diagnosis and therapy is needed because of the potential risk of mortality.	4.095847386754635
In the Department of Trauma Surgery of Vienna Medical School, mandatory surgical exploration after noninvasive investigations is practiced.	2.959770722248992
Injuries were caused in seven cases by gunshots, in eight cases by broken glass, in one case by an iron rod, in one case by a spear, in one case by a branch and in 13 cases the penetrating injuries were stab wounds caused by knives.	3.0703844493974377
Complications like pseudoaneurysms and fistulas were not seen.	3.3122693817250486
No patient came to death.	3.256009435705351
During a 18-year-period 93 patients (f=76, m=17) with a factitious disorder were identified in the psychiatric consultation service of a university hospital (incidence: 0.62%).	3.5462316837060546
50% of women were working in medical professions whereas only 6% of men.	3.2615686115939995
Chronic courses of illness were prevailing, but at least one quarter of female patients showed an intermittent type.	4.120984520683323
There was a classical Munchhausen syndrome in 11% of patients.	3.1522484612509487
Depressive and anxiety disorders (10%, 4%) were to be respected as psychiatric comorbidity.	4.134353422201646
Ca 25% of the patients suffered from a somatic illness in addition to the factitious disorder, and one third of the women had symptoms of psychosomatic, especially of eating disorders.	4.545448532256739
Previous somatoform disorders, deliberate self harm and attempts of suicide were to be noted in the psychiatric history of many patients.	3.367219860011585
There were frequent traumatizing events (foster home, disturbing family disharmony, physical and sexual abuse, early losses, serious illnesses) in the early biography.	3.235120032643914
Various psychosocial stressors could be identified in the actual eliciting situation.	3.8211550982974605
The results are discussed in respect of epidemiology, development and clinical phenomenology of factitious disorders, psychodynamics and psychopathology of deception and self harm, and therapeutic options in the psychiatric consultation service.	2.993641859785931
In a long-term follow-up we evaluated 40 patients out of 55 (73 %) with a subtalar fusion.	3.629187574925432
The operations took place from 5/84 to 5/91.	3.1946766859379583
In all cases the indication for the fusion was a post-traumatic arthritis after an intra-articular os calcis fracture.	3.7079143060400708
The evaluation of the overall results was carried out with three different scoring systems: a.	4.460346774464724
The Outcome-questionnaire, rating patient's complaints and the functional status based on the severity-symptom scale and functional status described for Carpaltunnel-syndrome by Levine et al.	3.3781383319432234
c. The clinical rating system (CRS) described by Kitaoka et al.	3.050175917008527
The statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).	2.935681571344996
Level of significance was based on P = 0.05 and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient.	3.5667494787079765
The Os calcis fracture was the cause for the subtalar arthritis in all 40 patients (33 males and 7 females).	3.316823599876068
The primary treatment of the calcaneal fracture was conservative (cons.)	3.471087970111103
using a plaster in 23 patients (57.5 %), while 17 patients (42.5 %) underwent open reduction and plate fixation (op.).	3.4451753167274264
The interval between trauma and subtalar fusion averaged 3.5 years (3 months to 20 years).	3.3096634970187777
The interval between subtalar fusion and follow-up averaged 5.2 years (4-14 years).	3.4390340938821375
The mean age at the time of reexamination was 47 years (26-61 years).	2.852530868790454
In the present study, complete pain relief could be achieved in 21 (52.5 %; 58 % op., 50 % cons.)	2.9220143689689024
A relevant restriction in the range of motion in the ankle joint was found in 26 (65 %; 76 % op., 58 % cons.).	3.9081426093915357
In 23 patients (62 %; 65 % op., 59 % cons.)	3.3121702036798606
the radiological evaluation revealed a grade 1  ° arthritis of the ankle joint, in the talonavicular joint in 17 patients (42.5 %; 41 % op., 45 % cons.	3.787528922471071
), and in the calcaneo-cuboid joint in 14 patients (35 %; 47 %., 27 % cons.).	4.20941543698108
The statistical analysis revealed a better outcome in the operative group compared with the conservative group, although the operated os calcis fractures in the majority were the more severe fracture types.	4.638054885021103
In all evaluation systems a score between 61 and 69 points could be achieved with no significant difference between the operatively and conservatively treated groups and between the newly developed questionaire and the clinical-radiological scoring systems.	3.443229225921391
For the questionaire this fulfills the requirements for a reliable outcome evaluation.	3.1892920670176728
Objectives Correction of an overriding fifth toe.	2.8947071450156354
Non-palpable breast-lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis.	2.885652854900136
Accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since freehand positionin of al localization wire is often suboptimal.	2.969728857299588
The consequences are larger tissue-defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result.	3.2042840078157395
Nevertheless, resection of microcalcifications by conventional surgery remains sometimes incomplete.	3.321319298175165
Digital mammography coupled with stereotactic biopsy procedures gives more accurate results with minimal invasive techniques.	3.033002670741448
The advantages and disadvantages of the advanced breast biopsy intstrumentation (ABBI) procedure versus vacuum biopsy systems are summarized and compared.	2.7571856055544166
Either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the methods.	4.309762909970509
Chondroid syringoma belongs to the group of so-called mixed tumors, like pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal and salivary glands.	3.800979059285451
The histogenesis of this tumour is still disputed, in particular with respect to its stromal component.	4.609696315843143
The distribution of cytokeratins (CKs), CEA, EMA, vimentin, S-100 protein, desmin and actin [-smooth muscle actin (-SMA)] was investigated by immunohistological examination of paraffin sections from a chondroid syringoma of the apocrine type.	2.7701395838535032
The neoplastic formations have been classified into tubuloalveolar structures, solid nests/aggregations and stromal cells of varying morphology.	2.921971077610061
The innermost cells of tubuloalveolar structures were characterized by marked expression of CKs (KL1 and MNF116), CEA and EMA, while in the outer ones there was moderate expression of vimentin, S-100 was expressed to a lesser extent and KL1, weakly but there was marked and consistent expression of MNF116.	3.003152780092889
Whereas the solid nests expressed vimentin, S-100 protein, MNF116 markedly and KL1 weakly, the stromal cells were consistently positive for vimentin, S-100 protein and, focally, CKs and -SMA.	2.6748743500476304
Anti--SMA specifically detects myoepithelial cells.	3.007795897530189
In addition, the partly overlapping immunoreactivity of the intermediate filaments, membrane proteins and proteins in the different structures may indicate a common clonal origin of all neoplastic cells in chondroid syringoma.	2.7392661794005964
Leg ulcers may be caused by many different diseases.	3.6287097133453785
Most frequently, they are due to vasculopathies, to a lesser extent to metabolic, neuropathic or hematologic diseases.	3.4354950035760234
Neoplasms, connective tissue diseases, infections, trauma, and panniculitis should also be included in the differential diagnosis.	3.205563267074749
The ulcers first appeared in childhood and did not respond to various treatments.	3.81104544198132
Additional features of prolidase deficiency included mental retardation, short stature, extensive dental caries, and multiple malar teleangiectases.	2.891267187343839
Hereditary prolidase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disease.	3.6619717602822064
It is caused by heterogeneous mutations of the prolidase gene and affects many aspects of protein metabolism.	3.031762847244742
Ion exchange chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis of urine can prove the suspected diagnosis.	3.0964568733207702
So far, there is no efficient therapy for hereditary prolidase deficiency.	3.317329740654991
All reported treatment attempts have ended in failure.	3.0091043816760012
In this paper the basic features of acute, subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis, skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described.	2.9346009509653945
The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms, culture studies, laboratory studies and radiological signs.	3.2248319010035296
In the treatment of post-traumatic/postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of multiresistant strains.	4.146841635782695
Thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics, a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed.	3.722110967624863
Despite this improved prognosis, an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon.	3.4668749996768553
Besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics, the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus.	3.638076236633025
Thus, physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics.	3.5757777253141962
Very early, i. e. in 1984, the German Medical Association developed professional laws for reproductive medicine.	3.358035913550029
In addition, the German government saw the need in 1990 for an "Embryo Protection Law" (Embryonenschutzgesetz).	2.843805417473125
Today, in the light of European integration, the medical profession's and state's obligations are challenged in different ways.	3.2219723404998923
Whereas the German Medical Association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics - currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the government must develop the sociolegal framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine, i. e. , in the areas of inheritance law, adoption law, family law, and law of succession, the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs. social paternity in heterologous insemination.	2.944830665003768
In Crohn's disease, some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following malabsorption of vitamin B12 or folic acid, opticus neuropathy, and polyneuropathy have been described.	3.1078053712252864
Cerebral vasculitis secondary to Crohn's disease seems to be a very rare phenomenon.	3.8123774984900036
We report on three such cases in three female patients (aged 26, 29, and 61 years).	2.9238586484517954
All patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis; one complained additionally of a speech disorder, headache, and intermittent loss of orientation.	2.8187233591149523
In CT and MRI scans, multiple lesions were detected; cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle- and large-sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis.	3.299453133391977
Serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time.	3.046187768399466
Under anticoagulation (in two cases) and immunosuppressive therapy, neurologic symptoms disappeared.	3.6650128426170743
The serin protease tryptase (ECNr.	3.1027502293154106
3.4.21.59), which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells, is released by mast cell degranulation in an enzymatically active form together with other mediators, e.g.	2.944294313408247
histamine, into the extracellular space and the circulation.	3.4391239718494027
The capability of the enzyme to directly stimulate several cell types as well as to cleave polypeptide hormones and to activate pro-enzymes suggests a role for tryptase in inflammatory and tissue-remodeling processes.	3.114391120330374
Therefore, in the skin, a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions, but also in other inflammatory diseases, degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing, where an accumulation and/or activation of mast cells is found.	4.123820811604582
Extracellular tryptase may be superior to histamine as a parameter for the onset and course of immediate type reactions and as an indicator for the activation of mast cells in other conditions.	3.755366435277054
Its absence during histamine-liberating reactions may suggest basophil activation.	2.851212422515987
In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues.	3.6443269144198878
Background: Since the development of lacrimal endoscopes with which the mucosa and disorders of the lacrimal drainage system can be examined directly, the choice of surgical technique has changed decisively.	3.9736066195146083
Flexible miniendoscopes can be combined with a laser for the first time, allowing for exact localization of the stenosis and subsequent therapy.	3.9550987944883347
Surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-B3 and C1- C3) makes high demands on traumatological management.	2.795324195109846
By using modern, minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta-articular fractures, it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result.	3.6906021297668112
The aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures.	3.311268024448418
Arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma, but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation, as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra-articular injuries, a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods.	4.071619506139884
From a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients at our clinic from September 1994 to January 1998.	3.6865768055862174
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients revealed good recoveries when assayed by means of the Lysholm and Delamarter score.	3.7401821250636718
We suggest that arthroscopically assisted, minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of AO classification 41 C1-C3 fractures.	3.6309758637965084
Dorsal tension band fixation is a wide-spread technique of finger arthrodesis.	3.5197669049899805
When using a resorbable PDS-suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed.	2.982603702193103
Aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup-in-cone-procedure.	4.311870316161117
From 6 degrees onwards the wire-tension-system requires a higher torque for bending, but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture.	3.3996990845460626
The examination shows that the thread-tension-band method by PDS-loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces.	2.9679979251970074
Modern medicine has succeeded in achieving enormous technical developments.	3.0707049048123762
One recent highlight has been the introduction of postmortem organ transplantation.	3.773567214757948
At the same time, serious objections have been raised concerning the radical changes in the cultural conception of the inviolable body.	2.9298784157806264
One major objection arises from the conflict of considering a brain-dead person as dead.	3.153645885981629
The presence of brain death is a prerequisite for post-mortem organ donation, because only during this phase of dying does the individual quality as dead while the organs, other than the brain, remain viable.	3.3877867592764557
The objection implies scepticism as to the physician's ability to distinguish a dead from a living person.	3.207908717266352
On the other hand, even the critics must rely on the physician's ability to discriminate, e.g., when to discontinue resuscitation.	2.8520550960841557
The medical community has not found reasons to restrict the definition of irreversible coma 25 years after its first formulation.	3.258065587203902
It must be clearly recognised that reasons other than medical ones can be decisive for refusing organ donation.	2.675435204581484
One ethical problem is the therapeutic benefit of organ transplantation.	3.531994035383744
The beneficiary of the treatment is not the donor, but another person, the recipient.	4.274529395475674
The concept of human dignity does not allow the use of a person fur purposes other than the ones he/she consents to, as Immanuel Kant stated.	3.097251466798251
Although the human corpse is not a person in the full sense, even if it is protected by the thought of respect for the former person, the life-interest of the organ recipient had to be considered legitimate.	3.8499406309666746
The resulting conflict between the respect for the donor and the life-interest of the recipient should be balanced by seeking the donor's consent as far as possible.	2.7767970236100257
The proposed information model seems adequate at the moment.	3.4229630353067084
The report dealt with the medical problems and harmonized them with the Christian value of solidarity.	3.155495878334341
The ethical alternatives to organ transplantation, however, are not mentioned.	3.652591679658966
Within this limitation, the report seems to adequately express the aim to strengthen individual competence and plead for fair perception of the neighbour's life-interest.	2.90042508187792
Starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly, as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport.	3.797032408518969
Elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour.	2.9261293081307818
Driver assistance systems, just available or soon on the market, are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers.	3.4132575486434047
An expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are: emergency systems, enhanced vision systems and parking aids.	3.486346994481211
Emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver's request, and direct them to the emergency location.	3.311214176907364
Self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve lightning and automatic dipping.	3.2482933356983033
Parking aids, using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with movability problems.	3.074612039681096
The group of helpful, but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car, comprising autonomous cruise control, antilock systems and electronic stability programmes.	3.143688772434513
The value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory.	3.652433001233073
Reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems, helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without orientational problems.	2.7223194447233694
The article demonstrates the particular importance of specific layouts of the man-machine-interface for elderly, to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic.	3.0061894664516924
Causal treatment regimens of proven effectiveness in controlled studies are only available for cases of male infertility resulting from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.	3.3987418468079147
Drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized studies.	3.2642446713435294
The results of immunosuppressive therapy in cases of immunological male infertility are still controversial .	3.3208902480004103
In addition, antiphlogistic and antibiotic treatment of chronic male genital tract infections has not been shown to improve male fertility.	3.636281580968205
Inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy - e.g., with kallikein, tamoxifen, clomiphene, pentoxifylline, mast cell blockers, testolacton, vitamin E, captopril, alpha receptor blockers, glutathione, indometacin, interferon alpha, growth hormone, zinc salts, ketoprofen, mesterone or testosterone undecanoate - or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement.	2.892159365440508
Recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure FSH, while GnrH and FSH have no influence on spermatogenesis in normogonadotropic men.	2.8373584661772036
In 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in 5 patients with non-AD dementia and in 36 cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).	3.647221547026566
Of the AD patients, 19 were very mildly demented (MMSE score from 25 to 28).	3.0308268539401375
Even in these patients, CSF tau was significantly more elevated than in controls.	3.453717608981849
In the non-AD patients protein tau was less increased.	3.679824723446133
Among the AD patients there was no association between CSF tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow, determined by SPECT.	3.5321519268143495
Our findings suggest that CSF tau may be elevated even at the predementia stage of AD and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease.	3.2983359439971895
The aim of our review is to summarize relevant data on the perioperative use of anti-ischaemic drugs in patients at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	2.967444119938837
The accessible medical literature according to current electronic information sources was explored.	3.032380709831206
One in every eight general anaesthetics is administered to a patient at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	2.8637514796952863
Of these patients, it is estimated that 20% - 40% have perioperative myocardial ischaemia (PMI), the majority being nonsymptomatic.	4.201067060577947
This figure correlates with the occurrence of postoperative cardiac complications and myocardial infarction.	3.6567119655804188
The anaesthetist therefore has an important role to play in reducing the rate of perioperative cardiac sequelae.	4.056235532009403
This can be achieved with good control of haemodynamic stability and the timely and appropriate use of antiischaemic drugs.	2.970498786465713
Nitrocompounds (nitrates, molsidomine) serve as the gold standard in current angina pectoris treatment.	3.2047316261982797
Acting as coronary and systemic vasodilators, they effect an immediate reduction in preload and have been shown to be the drugs of first choice for intraoperative myocardial ischaemia.	3.666052687518304
Beta-blockers reduce the rate of PMI to a greater extent than nitrates.	3.276288513590935
Single pre-operative administration of beta-blockers has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing theincidence of perioperative tachycardia, hypertension, and PMI.	3.494703102808845
Consequently, such one-time medication can be considered for previously untreated high-risk patients presenting for surgery.	3.7113096747348644
The continuation of oral calcium channel blockers to the morning of surgery also reduces the rate of PMI and myocardial infarction in coronary-bypass patients, and combination with beta-blockers enhances this effect.	3.582282717710637
Intra-operative diltiazem infusions are similarly advantageous in this patient group.	3.143100897323182
In addition to nitrates, calcium antagonists are the drug of choice for coronary vasospasm.	3.2045449157071846
Drugs inhibiting platelet aggregation have a particular role in patients with coronary heart disease, however, they also cause increased perioperative bleeding.	4.249957187780143
Consequently, it is recommended that these medications be discontinued 5 - 10 days prior to major surgery, with the exception of high-risk patients.	3.8207070702702692
Pilot studies using alpha2-agonists have shown reduced anaesthetic requirements and a reduction in PMI.	3.4055052601367217
The perioperative relevance of these drugs is currently being investigated.	3.5496802973665593
Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and possibly alpha2-agonists lead to reduced rates of PMI and other cardiac complications in risk patients.	3.0500744322147932
Current anti-anginal medications, with the exception of anti-platelet agents, should be maintained to the day of surgery and continued as soon as possible thereafter.	3.74206360075324
All of these drugs except anti-platelet agents may also be used intra-operatively, however, possible interactions with anaesthetic agents should be carefully considered.	3.8858236156100454
Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) were thought to be psychosomatic disorders.	2.778481548979817
However, this argument has recently been questioned by many researchers.	3.0567904825603605
At the same time, biomedical factors have been described that were claimed to play a role in the aetiology and modulation of the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).	3.7941494641997187
In the present paper, the state of research regarding both biomedical and psychosomatic factors of the aetiology and course of IBD is reviewed and critically evaluated from a methodological perspective.	3.3054514883144432
Results covering the following topics are presented: epidemiology; sociodemographic variables; genetic factors; dietary factors and cigarette smoking; drugs; permeability of bowel epithelia; immunological factors; microbiological factors; psychiatric disorders, affective symptoms, personality factors; life events and psychosocial stress; quality of life; and coping with the illness.	3.1467534027781663
Among biomedical factors, a genetically based pathological immune reaction is highly probable.	3.2879986295611094
However, the findings of immunological disturbances are of a more descriptive nature and seem to explain not the aetiological process of the development of the disease, but rather a kind of disposition.	4.03806745609905
The question of which agents trigger the pathological immune cascade is still under investigation.	3.112573208791744
Interesting findings can possibly be expected of the psycho-neuro-immunological research in this area.	2.875753001398484
Results of research on psychological pathology (psychiatric disorders, personality factors) are inconclusive.	3.286200254241362
In particular, some modern, well-controlled studies have not been able to confirm the findings of the older literature.	3.7574047668322126
Part of the high rate of psychiatric morbidity might be due to effects of selective sampling of more disturbed subjects.	4.141496396637014
Research pertaining to the influence of distressing life events has also yielded inconsistent results.	3.4999562704343568
Prospective studies about the association of psychosocial stress and somatic symptomatology mostly demonstrated cross-sectional correlations which did not allow for causal interpretations.	3.139325313897471
However, coping research has shown interesting results that point to the mediating influence of coping strategies on the course of the disease.	2.904873644183097
Finally, perspectives for future research are suggested.	3.0951588011261597
Genital infection, particularly bacterial vaginosis (BV), increases the relative risk of prematurity.	3.1228122187232636
Detection of disturbances of vaginal milieu at an early stage and the use of suitable countermeasures such as intervention with antimicrobial substances can reduce the preterm birth rate.	3.3779013456201468
A pregnancy with a partial or complete hydatidiform mole and a coexistent living fetus is a rare condition.	4.000074286809057
Most cases are consistent with a twin pregnancy, with distinct borders between placenta and mole on sonography.	2.8789879704024752
We report a case with a single placenta with cystic structures resembling histologically a complete hydatidiform mole.	3.1361529535753947
The pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the 34th week of gestation with marked hypotrophy.	3.2601986344947904
The non-molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of villous maturity resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus.	3.019174642996109
No malignancy occured post partum.	3.3117078699438665
The clinical and pathogenetic aspects of this rare entity are discussed.	3.5971830018531836
So far, necrosis of the lunate bone has been interpreted in the literature as a phenomenon with a traumatic, primarily vascular-arterial or mechanical causation.	3.179901466788002
These models seem problematic, since neither the patients' histories nor the macroscopic-radiographical or histological appearances can be reconciled with them.	3.1535209437935405
In contrast, the model of a primarily venous aetiopathogenesis accepted for idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head is now examined.	2.9224598510014665
Evaluation of 125 cases of lunate bone necrosis treated in the Department of Orthopaedics at the University Hospital in Heidelberg between 1958 and 1993 made it possible to reconstruct the spontaneous course of the condition.	3.9525202857311386
X-Ray material, core spin tomographic images and material from a prospective study carried out in 49 patients with unexplained painful conditions of the wrist were available.	3.7969798466865856
A stage-by-stage progression emerged, which initially caused alterations only in the MR image, while the X-ray picture remained unremarkable.	3.842933590466043
It was recognized from the spontaneous course that subsequent changes in the shape of the diseased lunate bones were always the result of the necrotic transformation process and never the cause of it.	3.7445311820272766
This meant that fractures were excluded as a possible cause of necrosis of the lunate bone.	3.5253045142780732
The spontaneous course was used as the basis of a stage-related classification for lunate bone necrosis.	3.8919700308328187
In a pressure measurement test, the behaviour of the intraosseous pressure in 16 necrotic lunate bones, 16 healthy lunate bones and 16 healthy capitate bones was tested under various functional conditions.	3.1542304675395294
The pressure fluctuations in the capitate bones were very slight, while in the healthy lunate bones pressure increased significantly during extension of the wrist.	3.1329719425954567
The position-dependent pressure increases in the lunate bones indicated that the venous drainage was constantly in jeopardy.	3.6363750333614324
The pressure increases in necrotic lunate bones were significantly in excess of those in healthy ones; in some cases they were far in excess of the systolic blood pressure.	3.4931848641012704
The anatomical causes of the pronounced pressure increases were examined experimentally.	3.1920930207399323
After staining of both the arteries and the veins, epoxy sheet plastination was used to fix six fresh cadaver arms in the neutral position and six in extension.	3.172650470745232
The anatomical preparations made it possible to see that venous drainage from the lunate bone was being prevented; this explained the pronounced pressure increases.	3.078624810153228
The unphysiological position of the base of the radius inclined in the palmar direction relative to the hand axis when it was extended dorsally was the crucial factor in the development of necrosis.	3.767842653572392
Evaluation of the histories of the patients with necrosis of the lunate bone made it clear that trauma was not significantly involved in the causation, while manual work had an important role.	3.7260564920158914
Most manual activites are performed with the wrist in extension.	3.6175753606130057
Any extension favours triggering of bone necrosis through congestion in the venous trunk.	3.187349524419969
Thus, our investigations have shown that the beginning of this illness starts with congestion such as occurs with every extension of the wrist, which is initially physiological, before further factors favouring the process cause it to take a pathologic course.	3.5927769058175825
The results of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 confirm allergies as widespread diseases in Germany.	2.721600866915806
In total 40 to 43 % of the adult population have or have had an allergic disease.	3.249825554509255
The morbidity was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire and a personal interview performed by a physician.	3.7418773081760883
The agreement between questionnaire and interview data is greater than 90 % for allergic rhinitis, food allergy and urticaria and about 80 % for contact dermatitis and asthma.	3.18405348590144
The results of both assessment methods showed remarkable differences between East and West Germany.	2.7513272254105368
Using the interview data 17 % of the West but only 11 % of the East German adults have/had e.g.	2.801054304498321
Comparable differences exist for contact dermatitis.	3.4759184398200182
Many people with allergies suffer or have suffered from several allergies.	3.0620077495171993
Frequent patterns of combination are food allergy/allergic rhinitis and asthma/allergic rhinitis.	3.030072594383107
The relative increase is higher in East than in West.	3.2135312239691505
The time trend in prevalence of asthma could only be calculated for the West German population.	3.148184985284202
The results show a remarkable increase here, too.	3.0546314184876397
Case report on a 72 year old female patient presenting with collapse and progressive dyspnea.	4.043239587767724
X-ray of the chest showed a marked enlargement of the heart extending to the right.	4.503541725278199
Echocardiography revealed an impressive displacement of the heart chambers to the left caused by a large aneurysm (11x5x5 cm) located anteriorly and medially from the right heart communicating with the right atrium.	3.81583456672193
Pronounced compression of the basal part of the right ventricle was present.	5.543408367503599
Within the aneurysmatic cavity several highly mobile thrombi and extensive spontaneous echo contrast were demonstrated.	2.732559719205594
On magnetic resonance imaging and right heart angiocardiography the aneurysm was visualized as well.	3.6468115914236097
Coronary angiography revealed a marked curved displacement of the right coronary artery to the left side.	4.100009138143825
Perfusion lung scanning suggested bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism proven by digital substraction angiography.	2.9783666745993482
ICD-10 was implemented for morbidity coding in Germany in January 2000.	3.0932130106261275
The electronic versions of ICD-10 are introduced.	2.3793885855411467
For everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by DIMDI: ICD-10 meta files, ICD conversion tables, ICD-10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms.	1.7588638463052335
All files are available free of charge via the INTERNET.	2.037416743026253
Possible influences of skin functions such as resorption, excretion and as a temporary reservoir for drug substances on hair analysis is discussed.	3.0292299807774006
The relevance of skin secretions and their interactions with keratinized hair fibers is outlined.	2.781959378327035
For the emergency treatment of sustained, hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia, antiarrhythmic drugs are the therapy of choice.	3.4284569794414206
Mostly class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine or ajmaline, are preferred.	3.5524184096006457
In hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia, electrical cardioversion should be applied, in case of recurrences, followed by pharmaclogical treatment with class I antiarrhythmic drugs or amiodarone.	3.9155610634667446
For the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, -blockers and/or amiodarone are the only effective drugs.	4.006506471528067
In the secondary prevention, only the implantable cardioverter/defibrillator has proved to improve the prognosis of the patients.	4.140579445910471
Insular carcinoma of the thyroid is a low differentiated type constituting about 5 % of all thyroid cancers.	4.127814919264932
Higher aggressiveness has been suggested as an important clinical feature.	4.123864836643972
The value of preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy is not clearly proven for insular carcinoma.	2.8338196020900366
The criteria for histological diagnosis have been outlined by Carcangiu et al.	2.6623206919277576
Because of its aggressiveness, radical treatment at primary surgery appears advisable.	2.8215266509396573
Its clear distinction from undifferentiated (anaplastic) and medullary (C cell) cancers is important, as thyroglobulin is regularly synthesized by cancer cells.	2.8576259899124694
Enrichment of radioactive iodine makes such treatment feasible postoperatively and at relapse.	3.0922883090141164
Follow-up should be performed as in highly differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid cancer.	3.3195724122011447
A patient series of eight cases is presented.	3.1209828911950424
While all cancers were advanced at the initial diagnosis, the observed disease courses were in agreement with the assumption that insular carcinoma is a more aggressive form of differentiated thyroid cancer.	3.18547516347153
The result of an investigation of 128 from 283 (45,2%) medical and psychological psychotherapists established in the city of Hannover is presented.	3.6234615546217186
The aim of the study is to characterize the situation of psychotherapeutical care not only by the number of psychotherapists in relation to inhabitants but also by the working time spent for psychotherapy.	3.295369455867959
In contrast to other studies, the number of medical and psychological psychotherapists is not different, nevertheless the psychotherapeutical care in Hannover is not ensured.	3.6483996285453353
Objectives Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in children without creating permanent damage to the tibial or femoral physes.	3.366867500561971
The semitendinosus tendon, left attached distally, is passed through a tunnel in the tibial epiphysis, led through the joint, passed behind the lateral femoral condyle and fixed to the outer aspect of the femur with a staple.	3.1732662419323834
The anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies which often remains asymptomatic until the patients achieve advanced age but may also be clinically manifest already in infants and lead to sudden death.	3.6737937144985837
We report the diagnostics and surgical treatment in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child and the necessity of surgical repair.	3.7899099523762216
The diagnosis was incidentally made during an echocardiographic procedure and confirmed by coronary angiography.	3.045878503518674
A reimplantation of the ano origin of the coronary artery was carried out wihtout using extra-corporal circulation.	3.631611739528687
Due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the related coronary risk, surgical repair is recommended also for asymptomatic cases.	3.22518110155167
The surgical management of vesicovaginal fistulae (VVF) is a matter of controversy.	3.034122367478649
This study deals with our experience with transvaginally treated patients suffering from VVF.	3.7593934409556256
Between 1966 and 1996, 64 patients with VVF were treated surgically.	3.8194184867199725
The VVF occurred in the course of hysterectomy in 54 patients, was due to radiotherapy in 7, was a result of obstetric complications in 2 patients, and occurred after colporrhaphy in 1 patient.	4.413045786698323
In 60 of these 64 patients closure of the fistula was carried out transvaginally.	3.8041548022799687
Fourteen of these 60 patients (23 %) had undergone prior surgical attempts to close the VVF (1 to 3 procedures).	3.364058380356893
Transvaginal surgery was successful at first attempt in 55 of these 60 patients (92 %).	3.1918603608012504
The other 5 patients were successfully treated by a second procedure (again transvaginal: n = 3; transabdominal: n = 2).	3.3820068014740974
In conclusion, the transvaginal approach to close VVF is of advantage, avoiding an abdominal incision and reducing postoperative morbidity.	2.755203503422326
In the vast majority of the cases isolated VVF can be treated successfully by transvaginal repair.	4.069907623370694
Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder involving muscle, brain, heart, eyes, and endocrine organs.	3.221133166471073
The underlying mutation is an expanding trinucleotide CTG repeat in the 3'prime untranslated region of a serine-threonine kinase gene on chromosome 19q.	2.6971702814687752
A statistical correlation exists between the CTG copy number and the severity of the disease.	3.191046213259611
Infants with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy have been shown to have on average a greater amplification of the CTG repeat than is seen in the non-congenital myotonic dystrophy population.	3.810814927554979
However, not all patients with many CTG copies develop congenital myotonic dystrophy.	3.2563379896285545
We present 13 patients with more than 1500 CTG trinucleotide repeats and show their variable clinical course.	3.1587349206584916
Whilst the incidence of psychiatric disorders decreases during pregnancy, the risk during the postpartum period increases significantly, often leading to the necessity of psychopharmacological intervention during the puerperium, and subsequently during lactation and breast-feeding.	3.636397579992235
Objectives Arthrodesis of the Chopart joint.	3.2566919274560138
Should a malalignment exist, it must be corrected prior to fusion.	3.2206965755097956
Elimination of painful functional disturbances and reduced need for custom-made shoes.	3.278961667944029
In 300 patients with 339 coronary lesions the percent diameter stenosis (%-DS) was assessed both by visual estimation and by digital quantitative coronary angiography (DQCA) by use of an on-line computer workstation.	3.167449644239897
The decision for coronary angioplasty in the same setting ("prima vista"-PTCA) was based on history, evidence of ischemia and visual estimation of %-DS.	3.478534472666846
In contrast to DQCA visual estimation led to a bimodal distribution with a nadir at ~55% between two peaks at ~45% and ~75% and a mean of 70.5  +/-  19.6%.	3.1074595248740327
Visual estimation underestimated lesions in the range of 30-55% and overestimated the %-DS between 55-99%.	3.6095808575835058
Visual estimation revealed a %-DS >= 60% in 251 stenoses (74.0%) of the 339 lesions, an estimate that led to subsequent "prima vista"-PTCA.	2.9903564539663656
Conversely, DQCA revealed only 184 stenoses (54.3%) with a %-DS >= 60%; thus, 86 stenoses (25.3%) did not meet the morphologic indication criteria for PTCA.	3.1416710824550087
The bimodal distribution of stenosis severity according to visual analysis with an overestimation of borderline stenosis severity reflects a tendency for "self-referral" of patients for PTCA.	3.182978779261501
DQCA serves as an objective tool in the decision-making process for PTCA and may reduce "cosmetic" interventions or justify to defer PTCA.	3.6147523295285713
Especially in the selection process for "prima vista"-PTCA DQCA-quantification of stenosis severity is recommended.	2.8240272287081223
S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum concentrations serve as markers of cerebral damage in cardiac surgery, neurology, or after head injury.	3.1980795571968352
In these circumstances, S-100 and NSE levels correspond with the results of neuropsychological tests.	3.5034956643199973
The present study investigated the diagnostic value in orthopaedic patients after joint replacement.	2.954545186778204
Since its introduction in clinical use more than ten years ago, propofol is well appreciated for sedation and supplemental hypnosis in anaesthesia.	3.2838725284986667
However the substance is approved only for anaesthesia in children elder than three years.	3.139637971432643
As can be substantiated by many data reported in literature, there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons whatsoever to withhold propofol from the younger children; this applies both to the use as a narcotic supplement and as a short term hypnotic for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.	3.3766614164781767
A sufficient therapy should be based on a differential diagnosis by means of an active standing test or a tilt-table test.	4.201272954426033
Three typical pathological reactions of blood pressure and heart rate can be differentiated.	3.574192492482842
The hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is characterised by an immediate drop in blood pressure (systolic drop >20 mmHg below base line within 3 min) with or without compensatory tachycardia.	3.568506116555815
Tachycardia (>30 beats per minute above base line within 10 min) without significant blood pressure drop but with a fall of cerebral blood flow indicates a postural tachycardia syndrome.	3.22880052991608
In general, there is no further somatic dysfunction.	3.697172176304609
Increased venous pooling is thought to be the assumed pathomechanism.	3.8374933552552646
A reflex mechanism evokes the neurocardiogenic syncope after a certain time of standing: sympathetic inhibition yields a strong blood pressure drop and vagal activation bradycardia.	2.8052719274885085
Proved therapies include use of the mineralocorticoide fludrocortison (hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension), of the a-agonist midodrin (postural tachycardia syndrome) and of b-blockers (neurocardiogenic syncope).	3.2123922009849806
Due to didactic reasons one can distinguish 3 gropus of such disorders: -  Paradigmatic diseases of the spine with an inherent proneness to stiffness.	3.0958263075672936
-  Rare diseases which involve a certain danger of stiffening the spine.	3.031466347534515
-  Rigidity of the spine due to scientifically unrecognised morphologic phenomena.	3.403499294661487
Modern approaches in knee endoprosthetics using computer-assisted navigation systems are based on matching procedures which refer to osseous anatomical landmarks.	3.215808949787437
However, surface replacement techniques require a correct position of the implants in relation to the bone, as well as an optimal postoperative interaction of the ligaments and the surface design of the endoprosthesis.	3.8711117179526675
Functional aspects are of elementary importance.	3.375146108777091
A 79-year-old man died of fatal haemorrhage into the soft tissue of the true pelvis 2 days after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy.	3.4855873136561155
Autopsy revealed a perforation of the left prostatic lobe with ruptures of the periprostatic vessels.	3.4799750824456064
A similar case of transrectal prostatic biopsy-associated complication has not been described previously.	3.055873254482774
The judicial enquiries were discontinued.	3.1465091398689315
Several different theories exist about the orign of kinetosis and the space adaption syndrome, with individual sensitivities differing significantly.	2.884831302165109
One explanation involves the hypothesis of a different otolith mass between the right and left statolith organ and especially a difference in the utricles.	3.42773198511778
A difference in mass results in a different sensitivity to acceleration.	3.883585396539567
For this reason we measured interindividual variances in saccular and utricular otolith mass.	2.452699623360084
Since the anatomy of the vestibular organ in vertebrates is based as similar principles, we selected fish (salmon and trout) as our study model to facilitation preparations.	2.8082091021684086
The maximum difference in mass in the saccule was 17% and was generally smaller in the utricle, although in individual cases was much higher.	3.2048697612453734
We assume that a misbalanced sensitivity of the statolith organs occurs but is totally compensated for by the vestibular system as long as physiological motion patterns take place.	3.103141133931312
Decompensation leads to kinetosis under non-physiological motion patterns.	3.058336663882383
When the vestibular system is better balanced and has an equally distributed otolith mass to both sides, the possibility for developing kinetosis or space adaption syndrome is much less likely.	3.174708533125152
The clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of haematogenous multifocal osteomyelitis, a rare illness, are described.	3.5234440523970836
Of clinical note are the pain, pseudoparalyses and restriction of movement.	3.1756877598576203
Staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in both of the cases we described.	4.2510274411058155
Sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for the localization of subperiosteal abscesses; scintigraphy is a supplementary examination for cases where it is difficult to establish a diagnosis.	3.7222320842816776
MR-tomography is the most reliable method for examination of proximal infected foci (spondylitis, pelvis osteomyelitis).	3.6270932458134344
In our view, the earliest possible removal of all infected foci by means of operation and parenteral antibiotics mare the most important treatment.	3.696413561252934
Interactions between the endocrine and immune systems are well known with special regard to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	3.358947251672787
Little of the literature focuses on the complex effects of cytokines on tissue responsiveness to glucocorticoids (GC).	3.500748076318363
In bone tissue, osteoblasts represent a valuable model for studying GC-cytokine interactions.	3.106973072099699
We measured glucocorticoid receptor (GR) number and affinity as a function of the exposure of cells to different amounts of IL-6.	3.309345979216033
Incubation for 20 h with IL-6 at increasing concentrations up to 2000 pg/ml yielded a significant increase of GR binding sites in both cell lines.	3.420712032911685
IL-6 was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone (1 µmol/l) on GR in both cell lines.	3.307259139988456
In MG-63 cells, expressing higher concentrations of GR, IL-6 deprivation via a specific anti-IL-6 antibody (100 ng/ml) significantly decreased GR.	3.291962864155199
In Saos-2 cells, expressing lower concentrations of GR, a 40 h treatment with human IL-1 (10 ng/ml) significantly increased both IL-6 production and GR.	3.537215293800197
Our results provide evidence that IL-6 is an autocrine positive modulator of GR number in human osteoblasts.	3.1106077934106224
Tumor debulking of gastrointestinal tumors for the reduction of tumor mass is intended to improve subsequent treatment efficacy.	3.4991154472031543
However, in advanced malignant disease, this therapy is often associated with increased morbidity and lethality.	3.476070133675166
Adjuvant therapies cannot be initiated when needed.	3.194016800989192
Therefore, long-term survival remains unaffected.	3.7507452290674688
Advances in biomedical science provide preliminary explanations for these therapeutic problems.	2.888574258856144
Modern therapeutic concepts like neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors are based on these findings.	3.880255067145788
The probability of complete R0 resections, necessary to improve long-term survival, can be enhanced by these therapies.	3.7311511832382833
The ongoing prospective neoadjuvant studies for gastrointestinal tumors are already very encouraging.	3.0356858491481686
The simulation of unilateral deafness is very rare.	3.6304533013952214
Objective findings are of special interest if it happens.	3.8834767538402204
A patient with alleged deafness on the left-hand side due to commotio cerebri was treated in our hospital.	2.9504686028488445
Pure tone audiometry showed deafness on the left-hand side and normal hearing on the right-hand side.	3.3157661392675415
However, stapedius reflexes were found ipsilaterally left as well as contralaterally right, at 0.5 to 2 kHz with a stimulation of approxamately 90 dB SPL.	3.075478900433608
Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were measured.	2.8749269848313537
The TEOAE had the same reproducibility but a very low response on both sides, such that inner ear function could not be evaluated.	3.5400783802192812
In comparison, the DP gram showed clear DP amplitudes over the whole frequency range on both sides.	3.021827592061041
Nonphysiological DPs could be excluded by assessing the DP growth rate at three different frequencies.	3.6536902757662144
By means of brainstem electric response audiometry (BERA), with which the IV/V complex was detectable up to stimulation with 20 dB SPL clicks, and the Stenger test, a neural or central hearing loss could be excluded.	3.077110726689411
Normal hearing on the left-hand side was thus confirmed.	3.34858707415998
In cases of simulated deafness it is possible to prove a normal inner ear function by DPOAE.	3.1653076955013564
Controlled studies of adrenal steroids in premenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have revealed subtle and inconsistent decreases in glucocorticosteroid (GCS) function, but prominent deficiencies of adrenal androgens (AA).	2.7481439663693954
Such findings have suggested that hypoandrogenicity may predispose to RA in younger women.	3.2777917118665103
However, recent prospective studies of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels before (x = 12 yrs) the onset of the disease (pre-RA) offer an alternative perspective.	3.214244981158429
Significant dissociation of serum cortisol and DHEAS levels was found only in the subgroup of premenopausal women who developed RA before age 50.	3.1307692715494957
This subgroup alone had significant deficiency in serum DHEAS levels.	3.0695472481933845
A growing number of casualties and the increasing restrictions of funding will lead as a consequence to changes within the field of trauma surgery.	3.8388442919617036
Despite these developments trauma surgery must maintain its major responsibility towards the victims of accidents.	2.97135956401125
Therefore the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) has to face the future economic and social challenges to influence the coming changes.	3.283941687566555
This role compromises the engagement in a continuous struggle for the high and global standard of injury care in Germany, for quality assessment, education and training, research and adequate public relations.	3.638265295273454
This paper outlines the aspects and visions of future trauma surgery and the means which may continue to guaranty international acknowledged standard of trauma care in Germany.	2.963803280198644
Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.	3.7544970306412706
Electrophysiologic investigations in 623 patients revealed eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation: Ablation of fast (I) or slow(II), modification of fast (III) or slow AV nodal pathways (IV), modification of both pathways (V), ablation of fast and modification of slow (VI), ablation of slow and modification of fast pathways (VII) and ablation of both pathways (VIII).	3.321818036424652
The criteria of diagnosis of these eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation are described.	3.11050895409979
Follow-up showed fewer relapses in patients with ablation (0-2%) in comparison to patients with modification of a single AV nodal pathway (8-12%).	4.28031134590356
Alteration of both pathways includes an increasing risk of total AV nodal block, which occured in 7 patients (1.1%).	3.5100641163769883
Detailed analysis of the mechanism of catheter ablation is recommended in all patients after radiofrequency current delivery for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia to estimate the risk of relapsing during follow-up or development of total AV block in the particular patient in case of a further ablation procedure.	4.768884316263263
An increasing life expectancy leads to a higher number of persons aged 70-84 years and persons aged 85 years and older.	3.174281277135699
Information concerning changes in the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity is rare.	4.60083465329666
The Berlin Aging Study was based on a representative age- and gender-stratified sample (n = 516) of Berlin citizens aged 70-100 years and older.	3.3401081086117395
In this interdisciplinary study, an intensive investigation was carried out by psychologists, sociologists, internists and psychiatrists.	3.1232384146749563
This report focuses on subjectively reported complaints (Beschwerdeliste, BL), observed psychopathological symptomatology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS) and psychiatric diagnoses following the criteria of DSM-III-R (based on the Geriatric Mental State Examination, GMS-A).	2.6368547972802605
On the self-rating scale (BL) 10 % of all persons reported severe subjective complaints, 32 % moderate complaints.	3.2845795177495645
On the BPRS, 17 % showed severe psychopathological symptomatology, 75 % at least mild symptoms.	2.907337126037675
Following the criteria of DSM-III-R, 23.5 % of all persons had a psychiatric disease, 4.2 % a disease of severe intensity.	3.1416389653866137
When the DSM-III-R diagnoses "Not Otherwise Specified" (NOS) were included 40.4 % of all subjects were diagnosed by the clinical judgement of the psychiatrists to have a psychiatric disease.	3.148542972527795
The most frequent psychiatric diseases were insomnia (18.8 %), depression NOS (17.8 %) and dementia (13.8 %).	2.743157175483409
Dementia showed the well-known age-related increase, whereas no other incidences of psychiatric morbidity were age-related.	3.919697950916533
Persons aged 70-84 years did not differ in the investigated psychiatric variables from persons aged 85 years and older, the only exception being the prevalence of dementia.	3.20577605689497
A first overview concerning developmentary risk factors and protective factors for later psychic and psychosomatic disease is presented.	3.1710793212336723
Problems within the context of the collection of data and evaluation are discussed.	3.511178034389976
We analyzed how psoriasis patients sought professional help and correlated it to their illness attitudes and feelings of stigmatization.	2.7533635073246794
Semi-structured interviews of 400 patients were reanalyzed to identify homogeneous groups concerning initial reactions at first manifestations of the disease.	3.131432529026214
Four groups ("isolated", "stigmatized", "socially supported" and "non-stigmatized" patients) were found and cross-tabulated with five resulting groups of a second cluster-analysis concerning the "style" of the seeking behaviour of professional and paraprofessional help and medical measures against the psoriasis ("multi-users", "arranged mini-users", "waiting-room patients", "optimists" and "self- therapists").	3.031963950319585
We were able to describe typical courses of illness behaviour depending on the initial reaction.	3.377907773202343
The results are discussed with regard to the desirable identification of problematic patients within professional care units.	2.894573066156823
The sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.	4.066730485346635
Malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform: initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly hypoechoic lesions can be found.	3.268794895202364
Generally, four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described: diffuse, small nodular, large nodular and bulky type.	2.89834669903133
Secondary, tumor-related or inflammatory complications (e. g. dislocation or compression of vessels, thoracic inlet syndrome, venous thrombosis, ileus, urinary retention, abscess and effusion) can be sonographically evaluated.	3.609836674945145
Response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor-related complications.	3.2387381705195795
Differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and, with certain restrictions, on the echogenicity of lesions and perfusion feasible with Doppler sonography.	3.5796364823949185
The primary diagnosis has to be established histologically.	3.885159061195249
The treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an antidislocation augmentation.	3.3186923306866376
Tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed.	3.2503704990210442
For the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft, which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach.	3.9665373715590655
In cases of posterolateral instabilities, additional procedures are necessary.	2.900060056110512
Ultrasound of the Achilles tendon is a suitable means of differentiating various diseases of the tendon and the surrounding tissue.	3.5238627523817443
Different forms of degenerative disease (tendinitis, peritendinitis or bursitis, fibroosteitis, and Haglund's disease) can be discriminated from rheumatic and metabolic diseases.	2.972627262574796
Congenital and developmental abnormalities can also be detected.	3.8731610895721276
Immature tissue in this area leads to temorary instability of the tendon with a high risk of rupture ("vulnerable phase").	4.352411024590357
With sonography, lesions of the Achilles tendon are visible early in the course of the disease.	3.4824933235725357
The German social security legislation has recognized only recently the concern of quality assessment in the field of social and medical services.	3.2529969203318396
The legal frame for quality assessment in the field of medical treatment was enacted in the sickness insurance provision (Social Code - Book V) only in 1989.	3.0224836513773417
Quality assessment is considered to be a part of the production of medical services and, therefore, is regulated in the context of providing medical services.	4.11393703519496
The legal provisions do not establish standards for quality and quality assessment.	3.185319898351361
Due to the variety of medical services, quality assessment is not regulated in an exhaustive or systematic manner.	3.400831444803801
According to the law, providers of medical services (doctors, hospitals) are bound to participate in quality assessment.	3.2763556153496696
As internal quality assessment prevails in the definition of the various measures of quality assessment and the control of quality in all fields of medical treatment, external quality assessment is also prescribed for hospitals.	4.559501750433733
Because the establishment of quality assessment is considered to be a part of the service production organization, consumers (patients) or their representatives are not involved in the definition, establishment, and control of quality assessment.	3.990450068208798
The participation of patients should be provided by law.	3.708285818259014
Introduction: Because of an increasing number of endoscopic hernia procedures, it is important to look into the possibility of standardizing these techniques helping surgeons to acquire the operative skills necessary.	3.525591620649608
Material and Methods: To discuss these aspects, the documented data on TAPP operations that have been carried out in this department since 1993 were analyzed.	3.3305153689779403
The results of teaching procedures were compared with those of experts after they had gotten past the learning and development curve.	3.218363591214208
Results: A total of 778 teaching procedures were performed by 10 surgeons with an individual experience of 30.5 operations (median).	3.2637323957895568
Before starting the first procedure, 89 were done by assistants operating the camera.	3.2389523668334808
The morbidity of teaching operations was 1.9 % compared to 1.4 % for those performed by experts.	2.98724433054612
After a median follow-up of 23 months there were two recurrences (0.23 %) in the expert group and none in the teaching group (follow-up 16 months).	3.553664868585703
Conclusion: Because of the potentials of standardization of the TAPP technique, the results of teaching were equal to expert operations.	4.31715469652433
Therefore, TAPP is suitable for application in a routine setting.	3.685634148640761
In spite of the high and lasting efficiency of transurethral prostatectomy, intraoperative blood loss results in increased morbidity in this procedure.	3.304150425782587
This led to the development of many alternative treatment modalities in the last years.	4.327086852709404
To minimize the risk of bleeding, we improved the high-frequency technology in several steps.	3.606698999269901
To achieve this, the output signals of commercially available high-frequency generators were modulated to the effect that each cut results in an efficient coagulation zone in the tissue at excellent cutting quality.	3.4095105928686347
Laboratory and in vitro studies using porcine kidneys as well as clinical trials showed good cutting characteristics accompanied by a significant reduction of bleeding.	4.279373804585078
As a result, blood transfusions were less necessary, the transurethral catheter could be removed earlier in the postoperative period, and hospitalization time was significantly reduced.	3.1650937520439197
In conclusion, the improved high-frequency technology in form of the "coagulating intermittent cutting" results in a blood-sparing tissue resection with a consecutive reduction of morbidity.	3.273193514563897
An accurate assessment of the duration of the ability to act following fatal poisoning can be of major importance in reconstructing circumstances leading to death, especially in determining whether the poisoning was accidental, self-inflicted, or the result of a criminal act.	3.9571330816134207
We therefore examined 20 legal autopsies performed at the Institutes of Forensic Medicine of the Universities of Würzburg and Leipzig as well as the respective records of the police and prosecuting attorney's offices in an effort to clarify this question.	2.9697129477589805
As a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10-15 min.	3.0951552823262767
However, the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer.	3.6415592760099478
The present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication.	3.166151525005442
However, in more than half of the patients the disease will ultimately progress within 2 years.	3.5574179431785296
Intermittent androgenablation through medical castration maintains the apoptotic potential.	2.957616610315603
By periodically changing phases on and off treatment the quality of life of the patients is improved.	4.434520827623816
Apart from reduced toxicity treatment costs are lowered and tumor progression is possibly delayed.	3.1208861321144825
In how far survival is influenced is presently not clear and remains to be evaluated in further clinical trials.	3.4926953919782315
During pressure support ventilation (PSV), the timing of the breathing cycle is mainly controlled by the patient.	3.922857798306552
Therefore, the delivered flow pattern during PSV might be better synchronised with the patient's demands than during volume-assisted ventilation.	2.7686201805709176
In several modern ventilators, inspiration is terminated when the inspiratory flow decreases to 25% of the initial peak value.	3.1697578623578866
However, this timing algorithm might cause premature inspiration termination if the initial peak flow is high.	2.946290633612189
This could result not only in an increased risk of dyssynchronization between the patient and the ventilator, but also in reduced ventilatory support.	4.146706815570009
On the other hand, a decreased peak flow might inappropriately increase the patient's inspiratory effort.	2.76420117088441
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the variation of the initial peak-flow rate during PSV on respiratory pattern and mechanical work of breathing.	3.0132870250384434
To date, positron emission tomography (PET) is the most powerful tool for the non-invasive study of biochemical processes.	3.466714303624249
Besides its usefulness for basic research PET has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications.	3.5505134603651483
However, the introduction of PET into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs.	3.2751822553186694
Several American studies lend support to the hypothesis that PET may be more cost-effective than the conventional diagnostic work-up - at least for some of its clinical indications.	3.3968226233114103
In Germany, however, this hypothesis has still not been verified.	3.6469936499559172
The rapid growth, development and organ differentiation during early human development depend on an adequate and balanced substrate availability.	3.080607936621697
It is well known that early nutrition has short term effects (e.g.	2.5867367486201998
on growth), and that marked metabolic imbalances in infancy (e.g.	3.827226864455189
More recent studies indicate that also variations of metabolic conditions within the normal range, which occur during sensitive periods of early human development, may have marked long term effects on later prognosis and disease risks in adulthood.	3.1285736629283405
This metabolic programming was demonstrated in epidemiologic studies indicating close relationships between indicators of early growth and the disease incidence and the mortality of coronary heart disease in late adulthood.	3.5303075613466506
Long term effects of infant feeding on immunological functions are indicated by the effects of infant feeds on later prevalence of allergic disease and by the difference in morbidity for diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease and malignant lymphoma between previously breast fed and formula fed infants.	3.3825866317897333
An improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate these observed long term effects is required to enable effective preventive interventions.	3.645785457053778
Already the available information indicates a great potential for actively improving long term child health and development by an improved substrate supply during pregnancy and infancy.	3.148096979076191
Persons who cross international boundaries are at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases.	3.2662544619150866
An analysis of the reported communicable diseases in Germany shows: A large number of cases of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, shigella infections, trichinellosis and brucellosis notified during the last years in Germany originated from foreign countries.	3.4464374407986735
Intervention measures are necessary, above all, with regard to gastrointestinal infections and vaccine-preventable diseases.	3.5476658559748677
Bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3,5 % of all testicular malignancies and to our knowlegde about 800 cases are reported in the literature.	3.183664918188712
An even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non-germ cell tumor.	3.0781950665938185
We report the 6th case of such a coincidence.	3.5094666341000975
The dignity of a contralateral tumor should be assured by frozen section and in case of benign histology organ preserving therapy is indicated.	3.292446616831399
Even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered, if the strict conditions for resection and follow-up are respected.	4.231800983835643
Most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic.	3.344358287557352
Besides the known effects of beta-blockers, among true antiarrhythmic drugs only amiodarone seemed to reduce total cardiac mortality in patients at risk.	3.1557832524569798
Reevaluation of amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker in primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death after review of recent publications.	3.013734495629568
Only augmentation of case numbers by meta-analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality.	3.1714365830963085
However, the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases.	3.877266484515155
This and specific side effects of amiodarone contradict a general primary prophylaxis with this drug.	3.743759981206966
An additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta-blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies.	3.469712188302539
At present, primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations.	3.063254881690829
As a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey at German epilepsy centers of usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following strategy is recommended:	3.886838368852218
An ecological theory of remembering is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment.	3.5873380832584987
The specific ecological relationship to the environment is affinitive, and also opens access to the ressources of the past.	3.2685815284658775
In the present study, conditions for this access (in particular with older people) were investigated.	3.2821599250723006
It is assumed that older people, especially, when they lose someone with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment, such as moving to a home, are rejected by older people.	3.195929581062861
These hypotheses were checked on the basis of material (N=120) gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed.	3.2743840168666525
To make matters clear, "typical" and thus every-day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material.	3.1203063621592357
Finally, practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged.	3.7579567604997357
Following Shouldice repair of a primary inguinal hernia 50 patients were given subcutaneous Redon drains, while another 50 patients underwent operations without drains in a prospective randomized trial.	3.1729320796611167
The amount of postoperative wound secretion in the drainage bottle was added to fluid retention established by sonographic volumetric analysis.	2.867130087454924
The degree of personal impairment was estimated by a visual analogue score.	3.458636389706893
Inflammation parameters were recorded as well as the rate of complications.	4.712258120329892
The drain group showed significantly increased fluid production in comparison to the group without drains on the 1st postoperative day (36.0 vs. 2.5 ml).	3.371238153142966
Wound sepsis was found in two patients in the drain group.	5.213690706033724
Seven patients with drains and eight patients without underwent percutaneous seroma puncture.	2.7806258809132776
The drain only slightly affected personal impairment (25.6 % vs 21.4 %, visual analogue score).	2.8996216778852872
Body temperature was elevated in the drain group on the 3rd day after operation (37.2 vs 36.7  °C).	2.920379491796903
We believe there is no indication for the routine use of a Redon drain in the repair of a primary inguinal hernia.	3.6290253198675493
Instead, percutaneous puncture of subcutaneous fluid retentions should be performed.	2.904965112949895
We report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement.	2.716261176008875
As a result of implanted cement/spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component, the iliac vessels were compressed.	3.030487999995471
Furthermore, we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65-year-old patient during a revision operation.	3.270924816177833
We recommend that in case of acute ischemic syndromes of lower limbs following total hip replacement, an angiography should be performed in order to exclude an extravascular cause of thrombosis.	4.1291290646479135
For therapy in those cases extra-anatomic bypasses should be preferred to thrombectomies.	3.4213302554638774
One of the most important occupations of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints.	3.8228511890989556
Such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or mobilisations.	3.6299296282923748
The pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion.	3.3355471739935476
Objective criteria for the diagnosis of disturbed spinal mobility are missing.	3.8673579619985943
They are not detectable in X-ray, computertomography or NMR.	3.383075734394441
In this article, we report on a family in which five examined members showed clinical signs of Fechtner syndrome, a condition which consists of hearing loss (49%), macrothrombocytopenia (100%), leukocyte inclusion bodies (100%), eye anomalies (54.3%), and nephritis (38.7%).	3.534978329036623
This article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es.	2.8471042033565657
Standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained.	3.3078053491873236
Different models of in vitro culture - monolayer, three-dimensional tumor cultures, and organ cultures - are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret ation of in vivo tissue.	3.4045040553363264
Two important recent extensions of tissue culture, serum-free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells, are described.	3.4394769063662016
The objective of this prospective, randomised study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) during the first 24 h postoperatively.	3.7009350462802093
For a quality assurance study on PONV, we compared two established general anaesthetic procedures in 239 patients undergoing four different types of surgery (subtotal thyroidectomy, laparotomy for gynaecological procedures, laparoscopy, and surgery for extra-abdominal procedures).	3.0994422851506105
The historical opinion that the intima layer of a ruptured artery of muscular type could stop bleeding by "rolling in" should be controlled experimentally.	2.964027313745078
Five segments of human femoral/popliteal artery (3-4 cm long) were overstretched until complete rupture occured.	3.69984862942449
Furthermore a longitudinally split and a partially oblique incised segment were ruptured.	2.8836182734649762
As morphological findings a sandclock deformity was observed in the region of rupture.	3.9479963794882726
This phenomenon was induced by adventitia layer, which closed the ends of ruptured media layer like a Chinese finger trap.	2.9487719725382115
In the longitudinally split segment a transverse rupture of the media layer could be observed, while the fibers of adventitia layer were pulled out when the traction was continued.	3.409881324539113
Neither macroscopical nor microscopical signs could be found for "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	2.616091274242167
The reason for spontaneous hemostasis after arterial rupture is more likely the activation of platelets by collagenous fibers of adventitia layer than "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	2.497678330690398
If there is no finger trap mechanism of adventitia layer like in shot- or stabwounds a massive blood loss must be expected.	2.8557779910599708
Time and again a lack of staff in the field of people's nursing is discussed (chronic lack of nursing staff); this means that there are not enough people to do the available work) (1).	3.5922421016483437
However, the time factor is also an important sociological dimension in old people's stationary care.	3.3690475242736473
First of all, this article points out the time dimension throughout life.	3.247633404291095
This is followed by people's varying perceptions of the present and the related upsets and misunderstandings.	3.5141659439635546
Hereby the contradictory abundance and limitation in time as felt by the elderly also becomes apparent.	3.1630222604739178
The old people's awareness of the dwindling remainder of their own lifespans conflicts with the seemingly endless time of each day that passes.	2.864355961342607
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology.	3.026054837306633
The main reason is the capability to obtain "in-vivo" micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo-transducers with an outer diameter of 2.9-3.5 French.	3.2883949371630905
For the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on lumenograms but also on vessel wall assessment.	3.6203659493962648
The capabilities of IVUS can be divided in its diagnostic and intervention associated potentials.	3.4376732504779453
The diagnostic strength of IVUS is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis, to assess intermediate lesions, to reveal occult left main stem disease, and angiographically "silent" arteriosclerosis.	3.2451116053719558
In conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve, patients with the diagnosis of coronary "syndrome X" can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis.	4.083956064055908
Additionally, IVUS is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the AHA/ACC Stary classification.	3.7731866470750837
Introduction: The chronic exertional compartment syndrome of the musculus tibialis anterior is thought to be responsible for a major part of complaints of the lower leg among active sportsmen.	3.3810281446119865
However, there is a controversial debate about the relevant parameters.	3.198063936561258
The development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto-orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature.	2.637468814939717
Only patients with a minimum age of 6 years and with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included.	4.205558759563537
The radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of pneumatisation at or above the level of the supraorbital rims, as projected in postero-anterior cephalograms.	2.9457059059652178
According to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72.7% of our patients.	3.590291913044797
There was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient, age at surgery or the amount of advancement.	3.6181057722823518
With the exception of severe cases of Crouzon's disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto-orbital correction.	3.403174876447634
Failures after ankle arthrodesis are, according to the literature and our own experience, more frequently seen with external fixation than with internal fixation methods.	4.189047158802227
A vital X-ray imaging technique in oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery is the panoramic X-ray.	3.679081512819731
Due to its variety of special projections, including imaging of the transversal level and low exposure to radiation, it is suitable for answering many clinical questions and for diagnostics of various findings.	3.4959526128105627
It has become possible to minimize the necessary doses by further development of technology and devices, as well as of X-ray films and by new detection systems, such as sensors or screens.	3.968318353122543
In some clinical cases, the diagnostic deficiencies of conventional imaging techniques make computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging indispensable.	3.261079880691231
Although MR is particularly suitable for soft tissue imaging, it has also become helpful in finding cortical changes by shorter measuring times.	3.1928972860089835
In certain cases, e. g., changes to bone metabolism, differentiated methods of nuclear medicine make image-aided analysis of function possible.	3.1798156402777065
Secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than 1 % of patients with Salmonella infections.	4.0003025583958065
These atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre-existing local or systemic disease.	3.6342849616326074
We present a case of a patient with known alcohol abuse who developed a septic infection of her right hip requiring resection of the femoral head.	3.4982669466424405
Histologic analysis showed signs of pre-existing osteonecrosis probably induced by alcohol intake.	3.6150243219939453
Cartilage and bone were invaded and destructed by an aggressive granulation tissue.	3.0157435991397654
Initially, a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour.	3.2766742270748317
The onset, clinical course, diagnosis and therapy of joint involvement by Salmonella are discussed with regard to our case and the relevant literature.	3.9531495253687354
This case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist.	3.82932733274733
There are two types of diabetes mellitus.	3.159384812966287
Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), which becomes manifest before the age of 40, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin.	3.7429284683131194
Type II, the non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), develops in the elderly and is caused by a relative insulin deficiency.	3.8207772045964257
Patients with type-I diabetes are prone to the development of ketoacidosis, while type II causes hyperglycaemic, hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma.	3.3110371671263463
Apart from these acute metabolic alterations, the long-term complications of diabetes are of concern to the anaesthesiologist.	3.370191106790172
Hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency and autonomic neuropathy are common and can result in myocardial ischaemia, cardiovascular instability and gastroparesis, with an increased risk of aspiration.	4.2947043496621005
Limited movement of the atlanto-occipital joint can cause difficult intubation.	3.247341590821225
To avoid perioperative metabolic catastrophy, blood glucose concentration should be kept between 6.7 and 10 mmol - l-1 (120 - 180 mg - dl-1).	3.076710303141909
Hypoglycaemia can result in neurological damage, whereas hyperglycaemia causes impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infections and worsens ischaemic damage to the myocardium and brain.	3.692493439105035
Perioperative diabetes management depends on the severity of the surgical procedure and the type of diabetes.	4.434970812507691
All type-I diabetics, whatever operation being performed, need insulin.	3.2338988199495247
The intravenous route is recommended as it allows better adjustment.	3.761265772163836
After determination of the fasting blood glucose level, insulin is given at a dosage of 0.5 - 1 U - h-1 (at gluc<11.1 mmol - l-1), 1.5 - 2 U - h-1 (at gluc 11.1 - 16.7 mmol - l-1) or 3  U - h-1 (at gluc>16.7 mmol - l-1).	2.686991071151914
In addition, 5 - 10 g glucose - h-1 is given.	3.703191428058346
In type-II diabetes the oral antidiabetic drug is withheld.	3.1669728451715895
During minor surgery the blood glucose concentration is monitored frequently, and if necessary insulin (with gluc>13.9 mmol - l-1) or glucose is given.	3.160506834180188
In most cases of major surgery insulin therapy will be necessary.	3.3037049684909765
Administration should follow the guidelines listed for type-I diabetes.	3.2409128340505418
Whether the intravenous or the subcutaneous route is used for insulin, repeated glucose determinations are mandatory.	3.1741746597385156
If ketoacidosis develops the volume depletion is treated with normal saline.	3.2910654831427832
For hyperglycaemia and acidosis insulin (3 - 6 U - h-1) with 10 - 20 mmol - h-1 potassium phosphate is given.	3.8292832243503443
Bicarbonate is only indicated when the serum pH is lower than 7.1.	3.7971416109999057
It must be borne in mind that perioperative management of diabetes does not end with postanaesthesia care.	2.801623229938607
At the beginning of the 19 th century, institutional care for the insane was established by the various German states.	2.9222628825491936
At first, the separation of curable and incurable patients influenced psychiatric care and the construction of hospitals.	3.099522116116911
The combination of care and cure in one hospital in Illenau was a turning point in institutional care.	3.031459361408337
Contradictory tendencies characterized the second half of the 19 th century: the integration with general medicine in the cities, on the one hand, the social separation and cure in the seclusion of the countryside, on the other.	3.1908901485859564
The following building styles were dominant: in England, panoptic architecture; in the United States, linear staggered structures; in France, the "carrés isolés"; and in Germany, the structure of blocks with cross-axes.	3.0054428023822206
At the end of the 19 th century, the system of pavilions was internationally accepted; occupational therapy and mental care in the countryside were introduced.	2.8612198159339566
From the First World War until the end of the 1960 s, a standstill in psychiatric buildings was noted in Germany, and institutional care came under increasing criticism.	3.248400856676581
There was a reorientation from the middle of the 1970 s as a result of more effective therapeutic possibilities.	3.370470294975988
A variety of complementary institutions, outpatient and partly inpatient therapies, which were recommended by the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", started to be realized.	3.217729707118724
Principles of organization like the construction of a communicative quiet inner room, or grading the rooms from public to private, were structurally integrated.	2.810332131153451
Specific structural requirements for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals should be evaluated in more detail by post-occupancy methods.	3.339779929436344
The coronal incision is a versatile approach to midface or skull base fractures.	2.978725251462042
By this method, primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced.	4.0191081350760545
All trauma patients who underwent this kind of intervention were re-examined to check functional and aesthetic results.	3.571582352016378
The complication rate was low and the advantages of these techniques are evident, so that it is suggested that the indication for this operative approach should be extended.	4.06499675429767
One case of a newly described, rare odontogenic tumor is reported.	3.5517896696167557
A literature review of 19 cases lends support to the odontogenic origin and metastatic capability, both regionally and distantly, of the clear cell odontogenic tumor.	3.005504864294475
We conclude that this tumor is malignant, with a tendency to recur locally after surgery.	3.6592954260264823
It requires an aggressive surgical approach and should be referred to as a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma.	3.8387003012893635
In our patient we saw a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma, both with regional lymph node metastasis.	3.314867707001514
The histological differentiation of this type of tumor from other clear cell tumors is difficult.	3.535203481231918
As the elderly segment of our population expands, there is an increase of therapeutic problems considering this age group.	3.575136623389926
The elderly patient is generally susceptible to infections because of the decline in host defense mechanisms that occurs with aging, and the underlying chronic diseases of these patients.	3.904836025109869
Increasing numbers of elderly people are being treated in hospitals and are additionally at particular risk of acquiring nosocomial infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms.	3.2128590103625685
This article focuses on the epidemiological considerations, risk factors, types of infections that occur in elderly patients, and the guidelines for empiric therapy.	3.984161942428749
The most common infections of the elderly are respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infection.	4.080548888629621
Empirical therapy should be broader in spectrum for elderly patients since the variety of infecting bacteria tends to be greater and the choice of antimicrobial therapy must be based on risk stratification (age, medical illnesses, and severity of presentation).	3.456945878308644
We present long-term results (minimum follow-up 5 years) in 145 patients with advanced non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, who underwent radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLA) after chemotherapy.	3.7185617583337387
We correlated patients' outcomes (death of disease) to different kinds of chemotherapy and to intraoperative findings.	3.4479574723734427
We found that patients who were treated by a modified Einhorn scheme with cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin have a good prognosis.	3.380614039583146
In all, 90 % showed no evidence of disease (NED).	3.225962512934596
The NED rate was significantly lower in patients who were treated by sequential alternative chemotherapy (DOD = 37 %).We determined the following prognostic factors which predict a poor outcome:...	3.6575362534263793
Follow-up studies after stent implantation of native coronary arteries have reported reduced rates of angiographic restenosis.	3.0146683752661483
In contrast, stent implantation in the treatment of obstructive disease of coronary artery bypass grafts is complicated by higher restenosis rates.	4.110871170655797
We sought to determine, if different predictors contribute to the high restenosis rate following stent implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts.	4.060277156198014
Multivariate analysis correlated clinical, procedural and angiographic variables with the incidence of angiographic restenosis defined as diameter stenosis >50% at follow-up.	3.0689470753934844
Angiographic restenosis was observed in 34% of lesions treated.	4.218112490591354
Multiple logistic regression analysis defined diabetes mellitus (OR 6.89, CI2.41-9.69), graft recanalization (OR 2.69, CI 1.08-6.63), lesion at the aortic anastomosis (OR6.98, CI2.76-19.25), lesion at the coronary anastomosis (OR 2.95, CI1.18-7.49), high diameter stenosis after stent placement (OR 7.01, CI 2.64-15.71), placement of long stents (OR2.78, CI1.11-7.36) and implantation of more than one stent (OR7.34, CI2.08-20.15) as independent predictors of graft in-stent restenosis.	2.750153426888001
Critical consideration of these variables may help to identify patients who are poor candidates for stent implantation and who may benefit from different interventional approaches.	4.00961843445358
To compare the conventional 2-D, the simulator-guided semi-3-D and the recently developed CT-guided 3-D brachytherapy treatment planning in the interstitial radiotherapy of breast cancer.	3.036827594030029
In 103 patients with T1-2, N0-1 breast cancer the tumor bed was clipped during breast conserving surgery.	3.308087162064107
Fifty-two of them received boost brachytherapy after 46 to 50 Gy teletherapy and 51 patients were treated with brachytherapy alone via flexible implant tubes.	3.269454869972114
Single, double and triple plane implant was used in 6, 89 and 8 cases, respectively.	3.5212836888311534
The dose of boost brachytherapy and sole brachytherapy prescribed to dose reference points was 3 times, 4.75 Gy and 7 times 5.2 Gy, respectively.	2.668277539788845
The positions of dose reference points varied according to the level (2-D, semi-3-D and 3-D) of treatment planning performed.	3.880860301674496
The treatment planning was based on the 3-D reconstruction of the surgical clips, implant tubes and skin points.	4.218491945164151
In all cases the implantations were planned with a semi-3-D technique aided by simulator.	2.9475790621168385
In 10 cases a recently developed CT-guided 3-D planning system was used.	3.060843822224028
The semi-3-D and 3-D treatment plans were compared to hypothetical 2-D plans using dose-volume histograms and dose non-uniformity ratios.	3.053069985714583
The values of mean central dose, mean skin dose, minimal clip dose, proportion of underdosaged clips and mean target surface dose were evaluated.	2.911492289169428
The accuracy of tumor bed localization and the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were also analyzed in each technique.	3.0645245126483833
With the help of conformal semi-3-D and 3-D brachytherapy planing we could define reference dose points, active source positions and dwell times individually.	2.601858964445927
This technique decreased the mean skin dose with 22.2% and reduced the possibility of geographical miss.	3.4076697931674733
We could achieve the best conformity between the planning target volume and the treated volume with the CT-image based 3-D treatment planning, at the cost of worse dose homogeneity.	3.4384916383546025
The mean treated volume was reduced by 25.1% with semi-3-D planning, however, it was increased by 16.2% with 3-D planning, compared to the 2-D planning.	4.775341264308322
The application of clips into the tumor bed and the conformal (semi-3-D and 3-d) planning help to avoid geographical miss.	2.772455028979627
CT is suitable for 3-D brachytherapy planning.	4.444779373123204
Better local control with less side effects might be achieved with these new techniques.	3.6347504071514702
Conformal 3-D brachytherapy calls for new treatment planning concepts, taking the irregular 3-D shape of the target volume into account.	3.8654002043156814
The routine clinical application of image-based 3-D brachytherapy is a real aim in the very close future.	3.4914604945472507
Background: Staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye.	3.405349259492488
In addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found.	3.060414334776193
According to Valenton und Okumoto, with this staphylococci-associated blepharo-kerato-conjunctivitis in culture-positive cases S. aureus is found in 31% and S. epidermidis in 69% of smears.	2.905760470279649
Microbiallergic and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology.	3.786357415786672
Multiple organ failure (MOF) may occur early or late after trauma.	3.2276464627211605
Besides direct physical injury of organs, compromise of the microcirculation by inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MOF.	3.169278606017199
Inflammation also induces counterregulatory responses which may end up in immunoparalysis.	3.126115428166603
In addition to this biphasic model of posttraumatic MOF, there is evidence that inflammation and immunoparalysis do not only occur in sequence to each other but in parallel early after surgical procedures.	3.136424368523655
The aim of the present brief review is to summarize the posttraumatic mechanisms of inflammation and immunoparalysis and to discuss how to differentiate between both pathophysiologic states.	3.160840638465347
Early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function ("gut injury hypothesis") and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or postinjury patients.	3.219638433055551
Nineteen severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score 40.3+/-11.6) were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube.	2.9031274777131952
Despite maxillary fractures, rhinoliquorrhea and blunt abdominal trauma the enteral feeding was mostly started immediately after trauma.	3.0818582563894963
Intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within 1 or 2 days.	3.6472548971853525
Total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases; a central venous line was always additionally necessary.	4.307973120217342
However, the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut.	3.215772659847409
The study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients.	2.531179921401082
The expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified.	3.9914130322720456
Enterally fed patients may have a better outcome that those in whom only parenteral is employed.	3.9559070580855815
Definition of the problem: The rapid pace of medical progress has drawn renewed attention to the various possible ways of treating dead or brain-dead pregnant women since the 1980's.	2.8226251510021214
The discussion today revolves around medical, social, legal and economic aspects.	3.183269696537799
The historical areas of conflict which surrounded deliveries carried out on dead mothers (usually by means of a Sectio in mortua, nowadays known as a perimortem Caesarean section) and their significance in today's debate are, for the most part, regarded as being of little relevance.	3.2199311660879455
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients, especially in AIDS cases.	3.904478965553633
The present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign-body reaction in a patient with successfully treated PCP who was known to have AIDS.	3.6290136987313897
This form of residues of completely healed PCP tends to be rare.	2.9052832038753595
Other infectious granulomas, foreign-body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed.	2.9498863763292182
After cautious decalcification, pneumocysts can be demonstrated with methamine silver (Grocott).	2.9440675100088236
It is important to be aware that PCP can also undergo spontaneous cure, so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of AIDS.	3.425349922501837
Background: In congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency high pre- and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence psychosexual and psychosocial development in affected girls.	2.9498464845370425
Methods: In order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality-of-life study.	4.043729331696697
We report on the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients (45) and their mothers (35) covering difficulties and problems in general, most aspects of their medical histology, self image, body image and current life with or without a male or female partner.	3.50739025828773
Results: The patients were socially competent with a well developed social network.	3.3721586422092087
However, regarding sexual contacts they were shy and reluctant.	2.9381844834014053
These resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are married.	3.0232844245821915
Existing partnerships were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population.	3.991606167061115
The incidence of homosexuality was not increased.	2.936477015385985
The number of women having children was significantly reduced.	2.809290782399679
A substantial number of women suffered from androgen-dependent problems like irrgular menses and hirsutism.	2.984171553097425
Mothers and patients denied any sex-specific eduction, but the girls had preferred boy-specific toys and competitive outdoor games.	3.1926882964582415
However, school performance was average and comparable to the controls.	3.374599853925798
Most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters intersexuality at birth.	2.923951121778529
Even though they felt they had received good medical treatment, mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help.	3.4610457064296902
Conclusions: It seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease.	3.438187675314219
Problems regarding partnership, sexuality, and fertility remain and have to be addressed.	3.684892743183985
Introduction: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become an accepted treatment for end-stage liver disease.	3.404565670785634
However, postoperative complications result in significant patient morbidity and mortality.	3.094196410993828
Early detection and treatment of these complications is therefore of utmost importance.	3.740662724518112
Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the postoperative complications of the patients who underwent OLT at our institution.	4.023362101413687
Duplex Doppler sonography and cholangiography were the primary imaging modalities in postoperative evaluation of the transplanted liver.	4.392868294059253
Other important techniques were CT, MRI, and angiography, which may contribute to a reliable diagnosis of vascular or biliary complications.	3.4901665436750844
Results: Second to primary organ dysfunction, vascular complications are the most frequent cause of graft loss.	3.6518332374128164
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery is the most common and most serious vascular complication, with a reported incidence from 4 to 42 %.	3.3911374895894753
Bile duct sludge, leaks and strictures are frequent complications after liver transplantation, which can contribute to graft dysfunction.	3.6750463226460717
Biliary tract complications usually occur within the first 3 months and require interventional radiological or surgical therapy.	3.7497669297112965
Since liver transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive therapy, they are at increased risk of developing late post-transplant malignancies, which are best depicted by US, CT or MRI.	3.79250714547596
However, radiological diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorder has to be confirmed by liver biopsy.	3.562796438577919
Conclusion: Cholangiography and Duplex sonography are routinely used in the postoperative evaluation of patients with OLT.	4.520190749876786
CT, MRI, and angiography are problem-solving tools in equivocal cases.	3.1991965784621748
Recurrence of colorectal carcinomas occurs in about 50 % of the cases with localized neoplasia.	3.503808598746172
It is understood that the tumor recurrence is due to residual micrometastases not found during surgery or extraregional (peripheral blood or bone marrow).	3.208780310016979
We developed a procedure to detect non-visible, abdominal metastases using a radiolabeled anti-tumor cell antibody injected before the operation (radioimmunoguided surgery, RIGS).	3.124661553375269
However, even with the best technique, it is not possible to remove all micrometastasis if a hematogenic dissemination happens.	3.388871430505231
Based on the knowledge of disturbing humoral immune reaction is mounted against shed tumor associated antigens (TAA), we developed a new method to reduce and correct the B cell response and B cell recruitment due to chronic TAA immun complex presentation on follicular dendritic cells (immune corrective surgery, ICS).	2.9920490356178107
This method is based on a selective lymphadenectomy.	3.792744016147627
The target lymph nodes were those loaded with TAA-immune complex.	3.01644120699209
The detection method used was the injection of radiolabeled antibody able to recognize the immune complex.	3.002002642246605
From 20 patients (stage I, II and III) treated with ICS, 17 survived more than 5 years ' showing a statistically significant increase of survival compared to patients treated with standard procedures.	3.5981747018717174
In conclusion, these data show that surgery of colorectal cancer should be selectively extended to specific anatomical regions in order to remove hidden micrometastases, and more importantly, correct postoperative immune processes that could suppress the T cell response against residual tumor cells.	3.4973337153925823
Knowledge of normal and impaired pulmonary gas exchange is essential to the anaesthesiologist.	3.654642600417802
Analysis of an arterial blood sample allows evaluation of whether or not pulmonary gas exchange is normal.	3.388942844556902
For this purpose comparison with the oxygenation index or the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference is helpful.	3.1789341137146945
Pathological changes of these variables are mainly caused by ventilation-perfusion (V.A/Q.)	3.3573613146625925
In daily practice, venous admixture or intrapulmonary shunt can be calculated using arterial and mixed-venous blood.	3.3402166488106455
By analysing arterial and expired PCO2, dead-space ventilation can be determined, but extended analyses of V.A/Q.	2.8094666953500855
distribution are not possible in daily practice.	4.142347349265266
However, knowledge of the principles of typical disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange in acute and chronic lung disease allows the use of therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiological changes.	4.470554579643015
Background: Infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions.	3.423187569034223
The case of a 30 year old man with acatalasemia is presented.	3.217086598123025
The congenital disorder  is charaterized by a lack or major reduction of catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.	2.768353274382093
The defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.	3.0961035740992124
Occasionally the defect manifests as progressive oral gangrene or Takahara's, disease.	2.9738671170249065
Poor longterm success has been reported for penile vein ligation the last few years.	3.475756147848
Therefore, we decided to re-investigate our group of 147 patients who were operated on between 1987 and 1996.	3.4909087121866187
All patients showed a negative response to intracavernous injection therapy at the time of diagnosis and revealed a maintenance flow > 15 ml/min, as well as a pathological venous flow with pharmacocavernosometry or pharmacocavernosography.	3.789778270863787
These patients underwent ligation of all superficial dorsal veins and resection of the deep dorsal vein of the penis.	3.6097606364190824
An up-to-date record of the success of the operation was kept either by a renewed clinical visit or by a standardized telephone interview or questionnaire.	3.6154300528987284
A total of 126 patients were available here for long-term follow-up.	2.9594176911386207
We divided the findings into three groups: complete spontaneous erection, postoperative response to cavernous auto-injection therapy and no changes in erectile competency postoperatively.	3.073881753566844
The short-term success rate for these groups after 1-3 months was an outcome of 31 (24.6 %), 25 (19.8 %) and 70 (55.6 %) patients; 86 % of the cases whose results deteriorated after the initial operation success rate had this happen within the first postoperative year (p K 0.001).	3.570273611118917
Favorable prognostic factors were preoperative erectile dysfunction of K 7 years, a normal CC-EMG and a maintenance flow of K 45 ml/min.	3.469214479652449
If all three parameters were present, the long-term success rate (spontaneous erection plus response to intracavernous injection) of 30 % of all patients was found to rise to 67 % in this selected group of patients (p K 0.001).	3.9171110375995335
This study reveals that long-term success for unselected patients undergoing penile venous surgery is disappointing; however, careful selection of patients by certain prognostic factors can improve long-term results.	3.2695466499960313
Pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems.	3.061000012264435
High dosed corticosteroids are the treatment of choice.	3.5312486259497553
However, recalcitrant pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives.	2.8053191436254012
Pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine A.	3.310081888979601
Because of side effects and drug interactions, the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored.	4.028092283208901
Six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum, unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies, were treated with oral cyclosporine A at mean daily doses of approximately 3 mg/kg.	3.34770691511575
Marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3-6 months.	4.7037742842552905
Only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment.	3.459079624205237
No severe irreversible side effects occurred.	3.1171423513567054
The results show that low-dose cyclosporine A treatment can be considered a first-line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum.	3.9356206720605678
Medical treatment of injured patients by international missions of non-governmental organisations in crisis areas and out-of-area operations by troops, and also national disasters require special trauma management.	3.1973943135563805
Deviations from peacetime surgical guidelines are obligatory because of long-distance medical evacuation, the possibility of gaps in supply and the typical pattern of war injuries.	3.335029901416224
Massive contamination combined with the high risk of infection is one typical attribute of wounds inflicted during a war or a disaster.	4.036301423666756
In contrast to peacetime surgical guidelines, aggressive wound débridement is often needed.	2.763273400723094
Timely and prophylactically prescription of a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a long half-life has great importance in the treatment of these wounds.	3.8663289182994744
Suitable antibiotics for these indications are: piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriazon.	3.0502954435519065
Nevertheless the use of antimicrobial agents will only be effective with early surgical débridement.	3.8256800223358356
Craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis.	3.581214798539726
The aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth, correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth.	3.390158562908557
Of the children followed up, 36 were male and 21 female.	3.305828575517127
Thirty-six cases involved untreated non-syndromic craniosynostosis; the remaining 21 were syndrome cases.	2.8076975626236402
The patient ages ranged from 16 to 27 months.	2.9558166028240866
In 11 cases correction of an occipital craniosynostosis was carried out.	2.9225606645396773
The fronto-occipital circumference was registered in accordance with Prader's percentile table.	3.2146252818018413
The operative method included a fronto-parietal craniotomy, the temporary removal and shaping of the fronto-orbital band and a vault cranioplasty.	2.7767803692010538
During follow-up 13 patients treated with fronto-orbital advancement in cases of isolated craniosynostosis remained in the registered percentile curve.	3.8186993761774453
In 13 patients a change to a lower percentile curve was confirmed; 1 patient changed to a higher curve.	3.664170823892216
In cases of syndromic craniosynostosis 10 patients remained in the post-operatively registered percentile curve; 8 patients changed to a lower and 1 patient to a higher percentile curve.	3.585278336683748
No growth restriction of the reshaped calvaria after surgical correction of craniosynostosis was observed.	3.3000147215035134
No significant difference was found in the potential calvaria growth between syndromic and isolated craniosynostosis.	3.786502995163868
Today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques.	4.075284891453094
The retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach.	3.35805261267011
The correct anatomical placement of the first trocar is of particular importance in procedures with the patient in lateral decubitus position in order to avoid injuries.	4.164411646821271
The overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the magnifying effect of the laparoscope, which is, furthermore, positioned very close to the operative field.	4.562571162261976
It is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation.	3.5663586560097977
The decisive anatomical aspects and landmarks in different minimally invasive operations on retroperitoneal organs are outlined.	2.8440356110030307
Lipid peroxidation is considered a prominent feature of age-related retinal degeneration.	3.9404927721839917
It is known that lipid peroxides can oxidize benzidine.	2.6675847359178126
This property was used to localize lipid peroxides ultrastructurally in the retina.	3.409921773204839
In a 73 year-old male patient with generalized atherosclerosis, known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, and coronary artery disease, an aneurysm of the proximal left subclavian artery was successfully excluded by implantation of a JOSTENTTM-Peripheral stent graft.	3.7011483315575564
Angiographic follow up after 6 and 12 months showed an excellent outcome with complete exclusion of the aneurysm.	3.7499315841839906
Intravascular ultrasound showed no neo-intimal hyperplasia within the stent.	2.903958494844813
A computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis of the aneurysm.	3.726944465611491
Based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in RA patients, new therapeutic principles have been developed, aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines.	3.1265204581393204
Both principles, however, have proven to be very effective.	4.3941406104198855
In addition, the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable, followed by a first, very carefully formulated protocol for human RA.	3.1563550113903482
Gene therapy for RA has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage, not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to RA patients.	3.6422557104218902
Several problems, such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved.	4.440042684823672
With more experiments this therapeutic principle might become available and might prove effective even in a disease with a systemic character like RA in the coming years.	3.182947349695193
In the case of typical whiplash after low- energy rear-end collision we recommend a clear and structured therapeutic regimen to overcome and prevent neuromuscular deficits.	3.1065071338567543
Patients with bony and discoligamentous lesions have to be excluded, as well as patients with distinct neurologic deficits.	4.034423495450254
A therapeutic rationale is the basis of full neuromuscular recovery ad integrum.	3.8031255360319465
The news of success in ether anesthesia on 16 October 1846 in Boston spread like wildfire through Europe.	2.7169306885081923
In the German-speaking countries, the national newspapers as conveyers of the development played a prominent role; this was especially the case for the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung whose correspondent, Aloys Martin [1], was a medical professional.	3.078985435278459
The function of local newspapers has not yet been investigated.	3.1616410840951374
This was to be remedied by examining both of Bamberg's local papers.	3.0806564007720043
All issues from 01.01. to 31.04.1847 were surveyed with respect to relevant announcements.	3.2822655447682383
These were then catalogued according to date, extent and contents.	2.870605321969149
Starting on 22.01.1847, the events outside of and in Bamberg were reported on in 26 notices and articles of just a few lines to half a page and in advertisements; Aloys Martin also appears on the scene.	2.7953010663009055
Thus, the local press in Bamberg also informed its readers early and regularly on the discovery of ether and the succeeding events.	2.7375236137830035
True arterial aneurysms of the infrapopliteal vessels are a rare finding.	3.467567866324579
During surgical treatment of convergent aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk.	3.750766276327803
We describe the special features of diagnosis, histology, and the surgical treatment of aneurysms of the crural arteries.	4.151248066172546
We recommend that even asymptomatic aneurysms be electively operated on to prevent further complications.	2.815569300822213
Dementia is going to be one of the major challenges of the next century for our societies due to the enormous burden on the health care systems.	3.666722893696409
Dementia is the major cause of death and the most important risk factor for disability and entry into a nursing home in elderly people.	4.014329114975307
Nowadays operative sperm retrieval in connection with assisted reproduction is a well-established procedure in urological-gynecological cooperative groups.	3.3673113639897028
Microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) and testicular sperm extraction (TESE) are the fundamental procedures in cases of non-reconstructable obstructive azoospermia or testicular azoospermia.	3.494996671519329
As they are often favored percutaneous techniques such as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) or percutaneous testicular sperm extraction (PTESE), need to be in Anglo-American countries and the countries of northern Europe, discussed regarding their efficacy (number of retrieved spermatozoa) and possible testicular injury due to blind or ultrasound-guided puncture.	2.8102208076546145
In Middle Franconia, one of the larger Bavarian administrative division (population 1994: 1,657,101), the number of patients suffering from cancer pain, chronic headache and chronic back pain is not known.	3.8437509877479714
Furthermore, there are no data on interdisciplinary organization of outpatient pain management.	3.174252738397756
A 34-year-old HIV-infected African woman developed fever, weight loss and widespread papules on her trunk, arms and face.	3.0479672280234165
Skin biopsy and culture revealed histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum varietas capsulatum (American histoplasmosis).	2.6345110736128
Even though antimycotic treatment and intensive care were started immediately the patient died because of the systemic mycosis within a few days.	4.055016448434945
Histoplasmosis is a rare disease in Europe but endemic in some areas of the USA (e.g.	3.3965809763707933
Ohio, Mississippi) and of Africa.	3.8973643443798394
Additionally histoplasma capsulatum varietas duboisii is endemic in Central and South Africa.	2.88759008540767
As a consequence of scientific advances, an increasing number of patients with advanced age, reduced myocardial performance, previous cardiac surgery, comorbidities, and emergency indications are referred for cardiac surgery.	3.422115652381651
This requires risk stratification to predict "low", "moderate", and "high" operative risk.	3.3792103738515453
Risk factors can be divided into pre-, intra-, and postoperative patient-, structure-, and procedure-related.	3.913757787980983
On the basis of this risk prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized by an individually tailored multiprofessional and interdisciplinary management.	2.9467460908290533
Unnoticed, minor damage to the unidirectional respiratory valves of the Draeger respiratory circuit may lead to intermittent and unpredictable malfunction, resulting in rebreathing and hypercapnia.	3.428273504444412
The damage may be so minor that normal visual and functional test routines may be insufficient to detect it.	2.878201793088696
We report one case of a potential life-threatening malfunction of the inspiratory valve and also propose economical solutions utilizing altered construction, modified machine-check procedures, or a simple instrument that adds only one step to the machine-check procedure.	3.354738515518372
The general problem of minor but functionally important damage to parts of ventilatory equipment - so-called borderline damage - may not be limited to this particular model or manufacturer.	3.195707313160098
Most users of ventilatory equipment believe that equipment that goes through normal check procedures is either fully functional or non-functional.	3.044408762862613
In reality, this is not the case.	5.301279683556497
Intermittent malfunctions due to slightly damaged equipment may be missed with normal machine-check procedures.	3.0029604273237203
This problem results in a significant but incalculable increased in risk to patients.	3.5384520379296323
Because of unclear reproduceability of intermittent malfunctions caused by borderline damage, there also is an increased forensic risk for the anaesthesiologist.	3.1168812918370095
The risk of mechanical malfunction might be displaced by software problems in new-generation ventilators in the market.	2.728865217811969
Purpose: To investigate whether the margins of microscopic tumors can be delineated better with monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles (MION), a superparamagnetic contrast medium, than with Gd-DTPA by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	2.8920129816894975
Nonunion of the ankle malleoli is extremely rare these days.	3.9975131566629134
This is probably due to the fact that primary osteosynthesis is performed in ankle fractures instead of the conservative treatment given up to 20 years ago.	3.9150961101318296
Today nonunions of the malleoli are seen, if at all, is infected cases after surgical procedures.	3.273003094490853
Noninfected, stable and painless nonunions usually do not need any surgical correction.	3.360567490237434
In painful cases, small fragments, especially of the medial malleolus, should be resected; larger fragments should be stabilized with two 3.5-mm cancellous screws.	3.6565986422104344
Alternatively, the tension banding technique, especially after Weber A fracture, produces high compression in the area of nonunion.	3.3299764989540463
In cases of additional bony defects, a local upside down cortical-cancellous bone graft should be performed in addition.	3.355047606390842
In summary, the therapeutic approach requires exact remodeling, bone-grafting and stabilization.	3.381407366964311
Infected nonunions with loss of bone mass should be treated according to the guidelines for osteitis therapy.	4.30773602816854
This study investigated the influence of the patients' educational level on indication for and duration of psychotherapy and the choice of treatment methods (psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy or psychoanalysis).	4.387862408980932
We considered treatments that were conducted within the framework of the statutory health insurance in Germany.	2.9544310935904536
Data were collected from the therapists' case history (n=274), submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies.	3.104997312182808
We found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy.	2.9783898541883884
In our sample 43.5% had graduated from senior high school compared with 25.1% in the average German population.	2.3420213609939435
This relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.	2.91721436451365
51.7% of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13.2% from junior high school compared with 48.7% in the average German population.	2.9291143953400343
Also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education, not on gender, age or type of statutory health insurance.	4.324960349053531
These results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are deduced.	3.3709654573360397
After the initial enthusiasm subsided lasercoagulation of the prostate has been criticized because the extent of tissue destruction cannot be controlled and many patients may be expected to have significant postoperative obstructive as well as irritative voiding symptoms which may last for weeks.	3.98213763100052
Thanks to new laservaporization techniques these disadvantages have been largely eliminated.	2.8615395410965627
With the Holmium laser a real resection of prostatic tissue is possible allowing the surgeon to see the prostatectomy defect immediately and to assess tissue destruction during the operation ("what you see is what you get").	3.1378840755684676
The postoperative voiding disturbances are diminished and comparable to those after TUR-P.	3.136365450196037
The classification of acetabular fractures and especially the diagnosis of additional lesions can be misleading, when the personal experience is limited and the decisions are based only on conventional radiographs.	4.120668853775666
The introduction of Spiral-CT with multiplanar reformations and 3-D views has improved the quality of visualization.	3.6558537189369966
Due to their higher costs, the need of these additional diagnostic tools is frequently questioned.	3.5840911825330157
This paper discusses the relevance of plain radiographs, 2-D-CTs, 3-D-CTs and Femursubtraction-CTs (FsCT) for the classification of acetabular fractures, based on a controlled study.	3.990223205063036
Methods: Thirty physicians with different levels of experience in acetabular surgery were divided in three groups of 10 each: group I comprised residents without operative experience in acetabular surgery, group II was physicians with 3-10 years of operative experience, and group III was experts in acetabular surgery.	3.576431828952029
The task for each candidate was to classify the fracture according to Letournel and to identify all additional injuries within the hip joint (e. g. marginal impaction, head fractures, etc.).	3.0087620341502523
The different diagnostic "levels" could be ordered stepwise according to personal need and no time limit was given.	2.8018653585313853
The case was finished when the candidate presented his final diagnosis.	2.984936876747408
The use of the different radiographs, the preliminary diagnosis, the changes in diagnosis, and the final decisions were recorded.	4.207042030946632
These findings were correlated with the different levels of experience and against a "consensus classification" which was generated by thorough discussion, and the use of intraoperative information and postoperative radiographs not accessible to the candidates.	3.9505230031000886
Results: The "correct" fracture classification based on plain radiographs was: group I, 11 %; group II, 32 %; group III, 61 %.	3.3728815452427403
Based on 2-D-CT a "correct" diagnosis was reached by 30 % in group I, by 55 % in group II, and by 76 % in group III.	4.144340670612922
With consideration of the "transient forms" in acetabular fractures based on Letournel and the 3-D-CT used mainly by group I, the rate of "correct" classifications rose to 65 % in group I, 64 % in group II and 83 % in group III.	3.8311881891486728
The modifiers were diagnosed "correctly" in group I by 37 %, in group II by 56 %, and in group III by 73 %.	4.369160070237719
The use of the 3-D-CT and especially the Fs-CT by group I resulted in an improvement in the rate of correct classifications to 61 %, whereas in group II the Fs-Ct was used only exceptionally.	3.6762135186238507
The 2-D-CT was the basis for the diagnosis of the additional lesions in acetabular fractures within all groups resulting in 73 % complete diagnoses in group III.	3.791355262961202
This study showed the importance of CT for the exact analysis and classification of acetabular fractures.	3.864103896709685
In particular, the secondary reformations in CT and the 3-D-views dramatically improved the rate of "correct" classifications in the group of surgeons with limited personal experience in acetabular surgery.	3.410951519589518
This allows the less experienced an acceptable level of "correct" diagnoses, so that the treatment options can be weighed correctly.	3.331104630166876
Among the "experts" a rate of divergent classifcations of approximately 20 % was observed, especially in "transient" forms of acetabular fractures.	3.601607263153193
Background: Iridodonesis is the clinical sign of lens subluxation.	3.3539617818682586
Acute glaucoma caused by a ciliolenticular block may develop.	3.677771066617951
YAG iridotomy or peripheral iridectomy are rarely effective in controlling intraocular pressure.	3.1323227105992424
The results of phacoemulsification and posterior lens implantation for subluxated lens and glaucoma are reported.	2.556194052283211
Cerebral perfusion reserve may be determined by assessing changes in cerebral blood flow using vasodilators.	3.40285959330764
Transcranial Doppler (TCD) may be used to measure cerebral blood flow speed in response to such stimuli.	4.317834936825095
The aim of this study was to analyze cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis and to determine the short- and long-term effects of desobliteration.	3.501460095964911
A total of 40 patients had bilateral preoperative studies done and 24 were re-evaluated 1 year later.	2.9069441830972003
The preoperative vasomotor capacity using TCD with CO2 was 57% +/- 45.	3.0260155284786783
Hemodynamic reserve did not decrease significantly in the early postoperative period on the operated hemisphere, and 1 year later hemodynamic reserve had increased to to 102% +/- 80%.	3.6662526926156143
One year later patients with unilateral stenosis (n=11) presented with a restitution of reactivity to 65% +/- 46% after initial postoperative ipsilateral decrease from 51% +/- 35% to 48% +/- 38%.	3.1140153000549735
Patients with bilateral stenoses (n=9) demonstrated an initial decrease from 70% +/- 60% to 48% +/- 21% and a significant rise to 115% +/- 77% 1 year later (P=0.02).	3.3446274201285107
Chronic constipation can be divided in two large groups: slow-transit constipation, caused by pathological intestinal transit, and obstructive defecation disorder, caused by pelvic and rectal wall abnormalities.	3.368876811128333
Videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are methods used to study dynamic evacuation of the rectum.	3.396149920076961
Videodefecography also enables visual estimation of rectal evacuation.	3.4396039743610576
Defecoflowmetry allows analysis of anal and rectal pressures.	3.310685086551717
Within this prospective study we utilized and compared these methods in 19 patients with slow transit and 30 patients with obstructive disease.	3.8725064129240567
In patients with slow transit, both investigations demonstrated a significantly higher defecation rate than in obstructive defecation disorder (slow transit: defecoflowmetry 65 %, videodefecography 80 %; obstructive defecation disorder: 50 % and 58 %).	3.0018026172513377
The evacuation time was pathologically prolonged in both types of constipation, with a range of 43-55 s. Rectoceles are demonstrated in 94 % of cases with slow transit and in 72 % with obstructive defecation disorder.	3.156370731829683
Also, we often found obstructive components in slow-transit constipation patients.	2.9303673015716343
Normal defecography or defecoflowmetry can rule out obstructive defecation disorder.	2.8551635413854854
We conclude that videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are important items in the complex diagnostic regimen needed in evaluation of chronic constipation.	2.907398783858938
Absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare developmental disorder of the human brain.	5.017955634488852
Previous reports focused on the association with other cerebral anomalies.	3.59396437310409
We present MRI scans showing an isolated absence of the septum pellucidum.	3.277036025003946
The patient was suffering from a schizophrenic psychosis.	3.331892465842532
Mental retardation or epileptic seizures, which are often found in more complex developmental brain disorders, were not observed.	3.820416682840265
The septal area is part of the limbic system and aplasia of the septum pellucidum could indicate developmental anomalies of the limbic system.	3.244787297698485
History and clinical findings: A 61 year old man presented with newly developed tachyarrhythmia.	3.9499285789679828
Echocardiographically a tumour of unclear origin in the left atrium was diagnosed.	3.944107646610775
Investigations: The heart rate in the ECG was arrhythmic at 146/min; intermittently sinus rhythm was established.	3.5515802589732846
Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a 90x50 mm tumour with sharp borders displacing both atria.	3.0048827658070927
The chest x-ray showed a mediastinal rounded mass in the dorsal part overlapping the right mediastinal border.	3.4241634895659168
Computer tomography was unable to discriminate the atrial wall from the tumour masses; hence the difference between an (intra-)cardiac tumour (i.e.	3.1994507336101905
myxoma) and a tumour of extracardiac (mediastinal) origin could not be established.	3.8887661850003528
Additional magnetic resonance tomography led to the most probable diagnosis of a bronchogenic cyst, which spread ventrally up to the ascending aorta and dorsally to the paravertebral region, thus displacing and shrinking the left pulmonary artery and the left atrium.	4.175020057856184
Therapy: For certain exclusion of malignancy and because of displacement of other thoracic structures the patient was operated on this mediastinal mass by anterolateral thoracotomy.	3.3731461900854005
Histologically a dysontogenetic, benign cyst with an inner layer of mesothel and nerval as well as vascular structures in the capsule was diagnosed.	3.4193633631732134
Since the operation the patient has persistent sinus rhythm without symptoms of relevant rhythm disorders.	3.53899212462653
An overview of different kinds of intrathoracical cysts is given.	2.893062789010231
Longstanding and untreated scaphoid fractures and scapholunate dissociations lead to painful destruction of the wrist with carpal collapse.	3.50490126868206
The severity of degenerative arthrosis is classified in three stages and can be treated adaequate operatively.	3.458680973548286
SNAC wrist (scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse) after failed fusion of the scaphoid and SLAC wrist (scapholunate advanced collapse) after scapholunate dissociation should be differentiated.	2.947290826222277
The reconstruction of the scaphoid or scapholunate ligament in stage II and III is no reasonable option.	3.8175548362844673
Motion preserving procedures such as proximal row carpectomy or midcarpal arthrodesis are preferable in this situation.	2.961729957004008
Thirty-one male patients (average 41 years) were treated for SNAC or SLAC wrist with midcarpal arthrodesis.	3.2797977476216
All patients were reexamined, the mean follow-up was 15 months.	3.393223767047826
Grip strength was measured with the Dexter-System, pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-100).	3.7033413884943993
Patients' daily activities and general quality of life were estimated with the DASH-questionnaire.	3.383274509168928
Pain was reduced to 50% compared to the preoperative situation.	4.460564298565993
Grip strength improved to 60% of the opposite side.	3.751469988775112
Active range of motion reached 50% of the contralateral wrist.	4.458957339906764
Nonunion at the fusion site necessitated additional surgery in four patients resulting in total wrist arthrodesis.	3.2414189606720223
80% of the patients returned to their original occupation.	3.941177974182136
Midcarpal fusion is a reliable procedure for treating the difficult condition of advanced carpal collapse is proper realignement of the carpus is performed.	3.182571300261801
The DASH-score reflects the subjective impressions of the patients in daily life and justifies the choice of a salvage procedure preserving wrist mobility.	3.6630267163017995
Total wrist fusion represents the last line of defense.	3.0312657025396645
Stress fractures are one of the most common overuse injuries seen in athletes, accounting for up to 20 % of all injuries presented to sports medicine clinics.	3.629027499087213
Runners are particularly prone to these injuries, however, it is difficult to predict injury as there is usually a critical interplay between the athlete's biomechanical predisposition, training methods, and other factors such as diet, and muscle strength and flexibility.	3.98282058915956
This article will discuss the key clinical findings for the majority of stress fractures encountered in a sports medicine practice.	3.3843058606125154
A classification scheme will also be described that will allow the clinician to make appropriate treatment decisions based on the degree of risk for each injury.	3.7809888547646935
Today, enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice, partially due to the belief that intestinal resorption of macromolecules is impossible.	3.310362671767561
However, there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity, and placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy.	3.413310725791207
The documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma, resulting in pain reduction and better mobility.	3.556209962368205
There are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery, traumatology, plastic surgery, and dental surgery.	3.1979563094389296
A further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes.	3.69347847213605
In gynaecological treatments, enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries.	3.7310137436693305
Further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits.	3.233540345155839
High-frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent - among others - two treatment options in hypoxemic respiratory failure of neonates.	2.961439701448433
We report the case of a term infant with meconium aspiration syndrome, who only responded favorably to inhaled nitric oxide following the initiation of high-frequency ventilation.	2.9924413679714332
At an oxygenation index of 17 we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right-to-left shunting and improve oxygenation.	3.415176578511985
How- ever the respiratory situation did not improve, the oxygenation index increased to 25.	3.29290475891445
After discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to HFV with mean airway pressures of 15 mbar.	3.159145280747134
Again oxyena-tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile 31.	2.9793229470341758
At that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of 10 ppm while continuing high-frequency ventilation.	3.3418907026380906
Immediately oxygenation improved significantly, the oxygenation index decreased to 9 within several minutes after restarting nitric oxide.	3.056378742576767
This effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high-frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from iNO could be performed.	3.51902997540264
Learning microsurgery of the middle ear requires preparations of temporal bones.	3.5976060004215356
Ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult.	2.9945249641362928
Due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities, the manufacture of facsimiles up to now has been impossible.	3.2601439884741485
Rapid prototyping techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one.	3.0154348885396445
By using CT scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3D pictures on a CAD workstation.	3.190141738124736
We are now able to incorporate data in a stereolithographic system to create an anatomic facsimile of the temporal bone.	3.1066420173432934
It is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object.	3.899499111827651
With this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching, training and research.	3.3322421580644397
Our artificial preparations of temporal bones correspond to both the material characteristics and anatomic details of human structures, allowing various surgical exercises to be carried out.	3.0558630702752527
During the past few years the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the most frequent of the rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases has improved a great deal.	4.640175228217764
The treatment strategy is based on the one hand on the so-called prognostic factors and on the other hand on the extent of the inflammatory activities, especially during the first phase.	4.730844209481283
Numerous controlled studies and meta-analyses have enabled optimal application of the basic disease-modifying drugs, with regard to efficacy and side effects.	3.8375480070284134
During the first stage of these disease, the immunobiological substances against pro-inflammatory cells are employed.	3.1922113016482543
Improved knowledge of physiotherapeutic treatment, correct diet and careful observation of the patient's progress with the aid of questionnaires enable optimal care with regard to life quality.	3.8898031005402536
Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) occurring during mechanical ventilation depends on expiratory time constants, expiratory volume and expiration time as well as on external flow resistance (tubes, valves, etc.).	2.9359618832740155
It is not routinely determined in mechanically ventilated patients, but it is necessary to optimize respirator settings.	3.955906280943922
The aim of the present study was the validation of an automated PEEPi determination method implemented in the respirator EVITA (Drägerwerke, Lübeck) in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung failure.	2.9117027070867554
The method was validated in ten sedated, myorelaxed patients with respiratory insufficiency of different etiologies (five with restrictive, and five with obstructive pulmonary disease).	3.1988201017828235
PEEPi was determined using the volume constant ventilatory mode at ZEEP or at an external PEEP of 5 as well as 10 cm H2O.	3.6607699644567138
PEEPi was first determined with the automated method implemented in the EVITA (five measurements at each end-expiratory pressure level; PEEPEvita).	2.9432737721504965
Steady-state was attained between each measurement.	3.3826665132017
These values were compared to the results obtained with end-expiratory occlusion (external, computer-controlled valve in the inspiratory limb of the circuit) at the respective pressure levels (PEEPEEO).	3.6765286254434932
The average of five measurements at each PEEP level with each method was defined as PEEPi for the particular ventilatory situation.	3.173560334514642
Gas flow was measured at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube with a heated pneumotachometer (Fleisch no.	3.2522675753381782
2, Fleisch, Lausanne, Switzerland) and a differential pressure transducer.	3.9083785386510237
Tracheal pressure was determined in the same position with a further differential pressure transducer (Dr. Fenyves & Gut, Basel, Switzerland).	3.4677755861167796
After A/D conversion, data were sampled with a frequency of 20 Hz and processed on an IBM compatible PC.	3.115258495390547
Software for data collection and processing as well as for control of the occlusion valve was self-programmed.	4.118771288236364
For the statistical analysis we used the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test; a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.	2.7146018943965817
At the given respiratory setting and without PEEP patients with obstructive lung disease had a higher PEEPi (median: 6.4 cm H2O; range: 5.0 - 9.6 cm H2O) than those with restrictive pulmonary disease (median: 2.3 cm H2O; range: 0.8 - 3.0 cm H2O) (P<0.05).	3.1044524810831367
Increasing external PEEP to 5 or 10 cm H2O significantly decreased the pressure difference between PEEPi and external PEEP (P<0.05), but was unable to eliminate it completely.	3.5873098347736323
There was no statistically significant difference between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita (P=0.43; Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests).	2.745558334344809
Regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita values (r=0.985, P<0.001; y=1.03x-0.18).	3.085519319989986
PEEPi occurs during ventilation in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease.	4.1684931491599055
The difference between external end-expiratory pressure and PEEPi decreases with increasing external PEEP.	2.8976515496123136
However, PEEPi may increase with increasing external PEEP in some instances.	3.0744774472208434
The reason for this may be that the PEEPi determined at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube represents only a mean value of different PEEPi values of various lung regions.	3.1104133435932373
Increasing external PEEP only partially alters this mean value due to an effect on PEEPi values lower than external PEEP.	3.241559309468355
The PEEPi values measured by the EVITA respirator compared with classical end-expiratory occlusion with an external valve were nearly identical.	3.29719114981416
We report on the case of a 70-year-old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a lipodermoid of the left eye.	3.4057002666068907
This rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient.	3.8639495311978376
The naevus spread on the left side from parietal to retroauricular, nuchal and sternal.	3.0848702778851798
Because of the patient's cardio-pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia.	3.114346654619587
We also made a partial stripped excision of the left-sided parietal parts of the naevus.	4.424732488064307
We describe an HLA-B27 positive patient in whom posttraumatic pyogenic sacroilitis led to complete unilateral sacroiliac joint ankylosis in the absence of any signs indicative of HLA-B27 associated spondyloarthropathy.	2.890688908573304
Ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has recently been shown, in a dose of 8 mg, to be superior to 1.25 mg droperidol in preventing postoperative vomiting.	3.6801871372615613
There are indications that a dose of 4 mg of ondansetron may be just as effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting as a dose of 8 mg [16].	3.0459901364488116
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the adverse effects of 4 mg ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to droperidol in patients undergoing surgery with inhalation anaesthesia supplemented with alfentanil.	2.812313773305515
Following institutional approval, 40 ASA physical status I and II women scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery gave informed consent to participate in this randomized, double-blind comparative study.	3.1301489744883044
Five minutes before induction of general anaesthesia, 20 patients received a single intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg of ondansetron and the remaining 20 received 1.25 mg droperidol IV.	3.481616604230534
Anaesthesia was induced with 2.1 - 4 mg/kg of thiopental and 0.1 mg of alfentanil IV and maintained with 65% nitrous oxide and 1.5% - 3% enflurane in oxygen.	3.296491365457428
On pain stimuli another 0.2 - 0.4 mg of alfentanil was given.	3.160298096638423
Total effective antiemetic response was defined as the absence of nausea and vomiting for 24 h postoperatively.	4.212176432601928
The incidence of nausea, vomiting and the number of patients showing total antiemetic response as well as the incidence of adverse effects were compared with the chi2 test and P<0.05 was considered significant.	3.7231992888906453
Patients were similar with respect to age, height, body weight and total anaesthetic agents received.	3.1392324288969213
Duration of anaesthesia and the time until awakening was not significantly different among groups.	4.1239741356118405
Postoperatively 7 out of 20 patients given 4 mg of ondansetron and 3 out of 20 patients with droperidol vomited (n.s.).	3.094436013164882
The incidence of nausea was 11 out of 20 in the ondansetron group, and 4 out of 20 in the droperidol group (P<0.05).	3.4347074897958394
Sixteen patients in the droperidol group and 8 patients in the ondansetron group showed a total effective antiemetic response (P<0.05).	3.839918014218659
Postoperative sedation and well-being scores did not differ significantly among groups.	3.878001812817186
Our results show that for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting 4 mg of ondansetron was inferior to 1.25 mg of droperidol.	3.100116040002351
The drugs were given intravenously prior to general anaesthesia for minor gynaecological surgery with nitrous oxide and enflurane in oxygen supplemented with small boluses of alfentanil.	2.9994856330998565
A 66-year-old woman died of internal bleeding and pulmonary fat embolism following repeated massive blows from a wickerwork carpetbeater and an electric cable.	3.0215241288337937
A second autospy on the exhumed body and an intensive criminal investigation revealed a long history of maltreatment by two sisters with whom the victim lived.	2.8280124173748713
The maltreatment occurred during exorcisms with the purported purpose of ridding the victim of her possession by Satan.	2.7849799527727015
The perpetrators and the victim belonged to the same pseudoreligous sect.	3.1870442763005613
The elder of the two sisters had been previously convicted of a fatal exorcism maltreatment of a 17-year-old girl.	3.517283297452794
Definition of the problem: The article discusses the ways in which sociological analyses can contribute to the problem of a just allocation of scarce donor organs.	3.0446984291424903
Since 1993, 30 patients with acute distal intraarticular radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	2.6761669189918216
According to the AO classification there were 3 B- and 27 C-fractures, most of them Frykman VIII fractures.	3.22828485899836
Of 30 fractures 23 showed additional lesions which could only be diagnosed under arthroscopic view.	3.6940472967616484
In particular, 12 partial or complete tears of the intracarpal ligaments were found.	3.0548223543818644
Of 25 fractures 23 which were treated at least 12 months previously could be followed up radiologically and clinically.	3.6514717923506326
X-rays included postero anterior and lateral views to evaluate the radial angles and the radial length and stress tests to check for instability, especially of the scapholunate ligaments.	3.6002009012853438
Clinical examination included range of motion and objective grip strength measured with a Jamar (Cedaron) tester.	2.758311494722393
Each test was performed on both wrists for comparison.	3.927077715085253
Subjective data included pain and function for daily activities.	3.2250075064372403
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and the Cooney scoring system and the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	2.087080038551465
About 70% of our patients showed an excellent or good result; about 15% had a poor result.	3.4137496270761916
However, we must mention that we were not able to reduce one C3-fracture under arthroscopic view and had to switch to a semi-open procedure with additional external fixateurs.	3.2182481289185727
Arthroscopically assisted treatment of distal intraarticular fractures is not only useful to detect and manage additional carpal lesions, but seems to give good midterm results as well.	3.3631284629967997
Antitachycardia pacing techniques (ATP) have proved useful for termination of ventricular tachycardia (VT).	2.9269104414578755
However, little is known about the efficacy and safety off ATP during long-term follow-up in a larger study population.	3.548197507920214
We analyzed the data of 80 ICD patients (pts) with spontaneous monormorphic VT, mean age 59  +/-  12 years, the mean follow-up was 26  +/-  17 months.	3.457445913674111
50 pts (62.5%) had coronary artery disease, 18 (22.5%) dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the remaining 12 pts (15%) had no or other cardiac diseases.	3.4464012778877846
2926 episodes of ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 349  +/-  51 ms, 240-520 ms) occurred in 64/80 pts (80%), overall efficacy of ATP was 89.9%, acceleration occurred in 4.1% of VTs.	2.9290445728915975
Success of ATP did not correlate with positive ATP testing on induced arrhythmias, LVEF, NYHA class or aneurysm.	2.9033642253171004
Neither underlying heart disease nor antiarrhythmic medication had an impact on the ATP success rate.	3.3307021513224986
ATP efficacy was linked significantly to short VT cycle length (VTCL, 240-300 ms, p < 0.01) and long coupling intervals (91-97%), p < 0.01).	3.1750919084206353
Methodological work was performed in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in order to develop suitable tools for non-invasive characterization of hematopoetic bone marrow.	4.194631420764445
The methods were applied for the assessment of normal values in healthy persons and to examine patients with generalized hematological diseases or to monitor effects of therapies influencing the composition of bone marrow.	3.817223777010891
Lichen ruber planus is considered a T-cell mediated immunologic reaction with unclear pathogenesis.	3.58822502234167
Drugs and infections (especially hepatitis B and C) are well-known provocation factors.	3.93804148314094
After an infection with scabies a 13 year old boy developed a generalized lichen planus including bullous lesions.	3.2422111175276664
For the first time scabies is presented as a trigger for lichen planus.	3.07307446836772
In childhood, lichen planus is characterized by atypical clinical features and sometimes a severe course.	3.9105778055419185
Introduction: Increasing demands on quality assurance und medical performance documentation require an immedate and evaluable documentation in the outpatients' department.	2.9221669695933383
Presentation of a new computer-based diagnostic system for reporting and medical performance documentation.	3.5930279438590547
Methods: Development and initial application of the system in three big orthopeadical or traumatological hospitals.	3.6371585662403985
Judegements about the feasibility of immediate documentation in outpatients' departments.	3.1992184454123187
Results: Presentation of an outpatients' departments diagnostic system with textblock-oriented anamnesis or anatomy-related diagnosis through pre-structured examination checklists.	2.823598168060297
Coding of ICD-9/-10 as well as AO-classification and AIS (abbreviated injury scale).	4.287171781510153
Medical performance documentation through forms including pre-defined billing codes.	3.1118595273011667
Presentation of the documentation flow and its transfer into other contexts.	3.1370972935127686
Discussion: Pure text-based clinical results do not allow sufficient evalutation for quality assurance and medical performance documentation.	3.134945535545489
However, a computer-based and immediate documentation in outpatients' departments should not mean a significantly increased workload for physicians.	2.873183344029424
Hydromorphone is a µ receptor agonist opioid.	3.1095334854907533
According to WHO recommendations, hydromorphone is to be classified in step III of pain therapy.	3.4037704441917733
An oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of 12 hours has been evaluated only recently.	3.4679382957388367
The controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain.	3.6191551019633663
The oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step III.	3.7158293464044485
Hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief (despite increase of doses) or causes intolerable side effects (despite treatment of symptoms).	3.0052216879913347
In principle, no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected.	3.487837328902086
However, clinical experience shows that changing one opioid analgesic to another one can improve the treatment of patients so that hydromorphone may replace another opioid analgesic to which a patient fails to respond well or develops side effects.	3.3067775117295453
The dose of hydromorphone equivalent to 2 times 30 mg controlled release morphine is about 2 times 4 mg.	3.0025621881292657
The values for the absorption, bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours -of three times the dose- are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every 4 hours.	3.4337832389163623
In several open label and controlled studies, hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain, especially in patients with severe cancer pain.	4.712594961892393
With regard to the incidence of side effects, no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established.	4.498243163214768
In general, the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics.	3.593048959477957
As augmentation, materials autografts from the iliac crest (combined with alveolar ridge augmentations in 16 sinus lifts) were transplanted in 39 cases and osteoinductive, allogeneic bone powder (AAA bone (autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone): n = 8, DFDBA (demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft) and/or GraftonTM (demineralized bone matrix gel): n = 35) were used in 43 cases.	2.947335721684419
Some 4-6 months after implantation, osteoinductive, allogeneic (demineralized) bone implants showed radio-opaque areas as an equivalent of bone formation.	3.658347910859468
Histological examinations revealed that osteoinductive implants were completely transformed into patients' own bone tissue.	3.1610985803182645
The average augmentation height after autograft transplantations was 14 ( +/-  3) mm in comparison with 9 ( +/-  3) mm after allograft implantations.	3.232831619871063
Histologically as well as radiologically no differences of the bone quality could be determined between the two augmentation materials.	4.988560472236966
Endoscopic controls showed, in both groups, nonirritated mucous membranes.	3.6998710832612134
On an average 2 endosseous implants (Bone LockR or ITIR-screw implants) were inserted into the augmentated maxillary sinus floors in both groups.	2.8788362298903163
No osseointegration was achieved in 4 out of 67 dental implants when bone autografts were used and in 2 out of 74 dental implants of the allogeneic bone group.	3.5419506444812927
Patients with bone autografts suffered from postoperative complaints on an average of 19 ( +/-  9) days (without consideration of 2 patients with postoperative complaints persisting for more than 90 days).	4.088742398224992
The average postoperative complaints of recipients of allogeneic bone implants continued for 3 ( +/-  5) days.	3.7244195952498074
The 13 patients who underwent an ambulant sinus lift procedure with allogeneic bone powder were already symptom-free several hours after the operation.	3.454445042876363
Under critical consideration of all investigated parameters, osteoinductive bone implants are preferable to iliac bone autografts for maxillary sinus augmentations in those cases in which no additional alveolar ridge augmentation is required.	3.0470196685198876
We describe a patient with a primary renal plasmacytoma.	3.4816666722061718
In the literature available, only six clinical cases have been reported.	2.8639242807159975
A 64-year-old patient is presented who had the clinical signs of a renal cell carcinoma.	4.927848256135344
Histological examination after nephrectomy, however, revealed a plasmacytoma.	3.832252621572543
Based on this case, we discuss how one should proceed in this disease.	3.2519301916606485
Primary renal plasmacytoma can be tentatively diagnosed preoperatively only in the presence of paraproteinemia or Bence-Jones proteinuria, as it cannot be distinguished from other renal tumors by imaging procedures.	3.5273685430118507
Postoperatively, further staging procedures must rule out bone involvement (solitary myeloma or multiple myeloma).	2.8347993963462352
Nephrectomy is required in patients with plasmacytoma only if renal complications occur.	4.017425144388198
Dissection of the ascending aorta (type A) following later after aortic valve replacement has been described with increasing frequency.	3.7459821937686195
This study analyzes the role of aortic valve replacement for the evolution of late dissection.	3.9703699138336117
Between December 1986 and November 1995, 222 patients with 225 acetabular fractures were treated operatively by three surgeons in the Department of Traumatology and Emergency Surgery of the University Hospitals of the Catholic University of Leuven.	3.1264723938086574
Indications for surgery were unstable fracture, displaced fracture through the acetabular dome and fracture with intra-acetabular fracture fragments.	2.8765711739436237
There were 37.3% A-fractures, 49.7% B-fractures, and 13% C fractures according to the AO Classification.	3.544367280556734
In 16.4% of fractures there were primary neurological deficits.	3.1532101252538496
Patients were treated operatively after an average of 5.0 days.	3.627333493256525
The Kocher-Langenbeck approach was used in 56.9% of cases, the ilio-inguinal approach in 27.1% and the extended iliofemoral approach in 4%.	3.473165571326154
In 7.1% of patients, a primary total hip endoprosthesis was implanted.	3.246431076565854
There was no intra- oder perioperative mortality.	2.5939894745373038
The average hospital stay was 26.1 days.	3.295823820582858
In 7.1% of patients, we noted secondary neurological problems.	3.2887156761605443
Deep infections were present in 1.3%.	3.9095020255378166
We were able to review 175 patients after an average of 2 years.	3.3189608951471814
Signs of arthrosis and periarticular ossification were noted on the x-rays: walking distance, hip mobility and pain intensity were asked about and recorded after the clinical examination.	3.380365538618897
In 76% of patients an excellent or good result on the Merle-d'Aubigne scale was obtained.	3.2518520784970355
T-fractures and posterior wall fractures were followed by the worst results.	4.178603379912623
During this 9-year period, changes have been made to the preoperative radiological examination carried out, the choice of operative approach and our policy on prevention of thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative ossification.	3.77281209362771
After thorough preoperative diagnosis and with a meticulous operative technique, it is possible to stabilise the vast majority of acetabular fractures through the three classical approaches.	3.6174969072509238
Because the fractures are relatively rare, their diagnosis complex and their surgical treatment difficult, specific training is essential for every acetabular surgeon.	3.3536089908817304
Diagnostic pitfalls exist when benign salivary gland diseases are mistakenly classified as malignant, with consequences for treatment and prognosis.	3.1320065326704967
Examples are necrotizing sialometaplasia, metaplastic Warthin tumour and sclerosing polycystic sialadenopathy.	2.737512776069207
The proper diagnosis is of eminent importance to distinguish cases of primary tumours that have developed in salivary glands or their lymph nodes from cases of extraglandular tumours with metastases in these glands or their nodes.	3.2631343494098113
Nasopharyngeal or cervical chordomas can be mistaken for pleomorphic adenoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma.	2.9736168277271684
The initial stage of malignant MALT lymphomas in association with Sjögren's syndrome demands identification of clonal rearrangement for therapeutic implication.	2.9039564529072983
The diagnostic criteria for proper classification are analysed in detail.	2.9287776447083482
A 59-year-old male patient was transnasally operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with hypopituitarism.	3.447412609516745
A second operation and X-ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor.	3.1466915024178936
Both neoplasmas were classified as sparsely granulated prolactin cell adenomas.	3.284329149015004
Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and FSH in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor.	3.7422969384461586
Two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated.	3.2669846936130007
A tumor in the liver was identified.	4.48935571005111
Biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology.	2.9836052333799947
After 5 months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism.	3.9645605165902773
Post-mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinoma.	3.374318096062068
Only six similar cases have been reported in the literature.	2.809155897416586
Our case report confirms the experience with 35 definite pituitary carcinomas reparted in the current literature: malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor, but only from its metastases.	3.375846067601607
Paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease.	3.3537346683844027
While some disorders almost invariably herald an underlying malignancy (obligative marker), most only occasionally do so (facultative marker).	2.8935631941947473
The association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial.	2.9752025101037587
There are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma.	3.802539277771591
We diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a 74 year old female patient, admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid.	3.5133159436540975
Multiple metastases were found in her lymph nodes, liver, lung and skeleton.	4.176499350819873
The patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared.	3.6571035171520228
Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature.	2.871252236353643
Closed femoral fractures and blunt soft tissue trauma are the main causes of this injury.	4.065688142473612
The multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur.	3.6090426647249876
Fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of extense swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient.	3.392985659582488
Sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury.	4.10489964544401
During the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated.	3.408324931839197
No direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome.	3.621944222282172
The tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy.	3.707030579010167
Conclusion: Early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain, paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient.	3.100930090707775
Tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign.	3.9399822105465074
Frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients.	3.589172809030198
We suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far outweighed by the morbidity that accompanies an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy.	2.8216266200598823
Aim: The long-term effect of DNase with cystic fibrosis was examined.	3.3551049750688366
Teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers.	4.460595702345931
The police publish difficult cases of unidentified bodies in dental print media.	2.842494714874749
Using their records such as x-rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification.	3.2898219873702677
To evaluate the efficency of this procedure 177 cases published between 1975 and 1995 were examined.	3.0318830883065466
Only 3% of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media.	3.7547144252953477
To improve the presentation of identification cases in the dental print media 500 dentists were asked to take part in a survey.	3.293586520777557
According to these results a new concept of presentation sould be developed to improve the efficency of this odontoforensic method.	3.1247342016835518
New technological possibilities such as digital x-raying or online data transfer could open new ways for forensic identification.	2.695787084398097
In a fatality after oral intake of a large amount of an insecticide spray consisting of propoxur, tetramethrine and the solvents isopropanol and benzyl alcohol, a coagulation nectrotic fixation of the oesophagus and stomach were the main morphological findings.	3.0022673180629913
The concentrations determined by HPLC and GC/MS in femoral blood, liver, kidney, vitreous humor and liquor were in the comatose lethal range for propoxur (< 0.3-18 µg/g), whereas tetrametrin (up to 0.1 µg/g) was almost completely decomposed.	3.1512222224343427
The propoxur decomposition product o-isopropoxyphenol (2.8-56 µg/g), benzyl alcohol (18-58 µg/g) and its oxydation product benzoic acid (85-140 µg/g), isopropanol (0.45-1.1 mg/g) and acetone (0.01-0.03 mg/g) were also found.	3.0583560396018927
On the other hand, the concentrations in heart blood and lung tissue were up to 30 times higher.	2.8889989498730313
The extent of the metabolization of propoxur to o-isopropoxyphenol and of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid, which is assumed to proceed mainly postmortem, was quite different in the materials investigated and was almost complete in the liver.	3.21822604230258
The intoxication by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor propoxur in combination with the neurotoxic effect of tetramethrine was determined as the cause of death.	3.2830715933245913
Background: Despite the fact that deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLKP) is less invasive than to penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), this procedure is rarely performed.	3.3837431534412215
We therefore investigated whether or not the DLKP technique we employed can achieve stable improvement of visual acuity.	3.0137135481555415
Palmoplantar keratodermia (PPK) varians and PPK punctata are considered different entities within the group of hereditary palmoplantar keratodermas.	3.100958513897916
Keratosis punctata of the palmar creases constitutes a localized form of keratodermia palmoplantaris punctata.	2.9565873494122354
In view of the co-occurrence of these two types of PPK, the question arises whether keratosis palmoplantaris of the varians and the punctate type represent distinct entities or represent variable manifestations of the same gene defect.	3.204788802225614
The author gives a synoptic view on the paths and routes of emigration the jewish and/or political reasons persecuted psychoanalysts had to take in order to escape national socialist Germany.	3.04474756135669
With reference to current studies on emigration, which for Germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between 1933 and 1938, the immigration policy especially of the United States and Great Britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed.	3.0765818504382905
Acute suppurative thyroiditis is very rare in childhood.	3.464922726807162
We describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children, and add 2 own cases of this rare disease.	3.7718603179795775
In the first case, diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid.	3.397923483291726
Operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then.	4.0744139296453135
In the second case, a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only.	3.168586481816015
In conclusion, especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection.	3.4941660647452215
If present, complete removal of the fistula is essential for permanent cure.	4.338830168922902
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	1.8784627116927504
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	2.254804042304058
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n=98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	2.2950155272115493
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	2.2378254770371893
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	1.8374991796483011
Simpson in Scotland was the first to describe the administration of ether for analgesia in painful deliveries.	3.67919319285546
Only a few days later E.C.J.	3.3491234224637756
Following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non-pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour, he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients.	3.2621518929791304
The first administration was on February 25th 1847.	2.9021578395551204
While he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new-born, he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients.	3.3091198620817983
He concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery, since it disturbed the natural course of labour.	3.2486779516104636
On the other hand, von Siebold was very pleased with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention.	2.6995879480295066
Background: Mode switching aims to maintain a ventricular rhythm that matches metabolic needs during both sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias.	3.014448863463945
This allows patients with atrial arrhythmias to benefit from AV synchronous pacing modes.Aim and method: Beat-to-beat mode switching in Diamond and Clarity pacemakers is designed to maintain a relatively stable ventricular rhythm, ensuring consistent ventricular filling patterns.	2.957914663525939
Atrial tachyarrhythmia detection is based on a continuous analysis of the atrial rhythm.	4.910996442491455
A too rapid increase of the atrial rate with a beat-to-beat acceleration > 15 bpm is considered to be an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	3.7908257255459663
Atrial pacing restores AV synchrony immediately after cessation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia, effectively avoiding retrograde conduction.	3.1653906936121228
Dedicated diagnostic functions allow one to monitor the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to study atrial and ventricular events just prior to its onset.	4.133169401256476
Both the mode switching and rate responsive function are fully automatic, rendering follow-up procedures easy and less time-consuming.	3.2553806039524313
Conclusion: Reliable detection of all atrial events is essential to guarantee appropriate mode switching.	3.33867064670153
Therefore, the pacemaker stores the distribution of the amplitude of all atrial events, both during sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias, which facilitates the appropriate programming of the atrial sensitivity.	3.3578241084309592
Introduction: Mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by CT and MRI.	3.8974538099101887
The applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air- and bone-containing thorax, which permits only restricted echo windows.	3.2506917839539025
Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography circumvents this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum.	3.3160228662598
Blood glucose alterations prior to cerebral ischaemia are associated with poor neurologic outcome, possibly due to extensive lactic acidosis or energy failure.	3.1929038078710366
Cerebral effects of hyper- or hypoglycaemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are less well known.	2.990550094785981
In addition, little information is available concerning cardiac effects of blood glucose alterations.	3.1234012772971984
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre-cardiac-arrest hypo- or hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia upon haemodynamics, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism (CMRO2), and regional cardiac blood flow during CPR subsequent to 3 min of cardiac and respiratory arrest and after restoration of spontaneous circulation.	2.8711278880593802
After approval by the State Animal Investigation Committee, 29 mechanically ventilated, anaesthetised pigs were instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and blood flow determination by the radiolabeled microsphere technique.	2.6976222811039956
The animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups: in group I (n=9) blood glucose was not manipulated; in group II (n=10) blood glucose was increased by slow infusion of 40% glucose to 319 +/- 13 mg/dl; in group III (n=10) blood glucose was lowered by careful titration with insulin to 34 +/- 2 mg/dl.	3.7714534257527923
After 3 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and respiratory arrest, CPR (chest compressor/ventilator (Thumper) and epinephrine infusion) was commenced and continued for 8 min.	3.0181738739200865
Thereafter, defibrillation was attempted, and if successful, the animals were observed for another 240 min.	3.3425984093974344
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), CBF, CMRO2, coronary perfusion pressure (CorPP), and regional cardiac blood flow were determined at control, after 3 min of CPR, and at 10, 30, and 240 min post-CPR.	3.5252826048103874
In group I, 4/9 animals (44%) could be successfully resuscitated; in group II 4/10 (40%); and in group III 0/10 (0%).	4.191520382866112
In group I, CPP during CPR was 26 +/- 6 mmHg; CBF 31 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g CMRO2 3.8 +/- 1.2 ml/min/100 g; CorPP 18 +/- 5 mmHg; and left ventricular (LV) flow 35 +/- 15 ml/min/100 g. In group II: CPP=21 +/- 5; CBF 21 +/- 7; CMRO2 1.8 +/- 0.8; CorPP 16 +/- 6; and LV flow 22 +/- 9; and in group III: CPP 15 +/- 3; CBF 11 +/- 8; CMRO2 1.5 +/- 1.1; CorPP 4 +/- 2; and LV flow 19 +/- 10.	3.6601791753053416
During the 240-min post-resuscitation period, there were no differences in CBF, CMRO2, or LV flow between groups I and II.	3.1343940058704627
Hypoglycaemia prior to cardiac arrest appears to be predictive for a poor cardiac outcome, whereas hyperglycaemia does not impair resuscitability compared to normoglycaemia.	3.3733333269524812
In addition, hyperglycaemia did not affect LV flow, CBF, or CMRO2.	2.8344920479324247
However, it has to be kept in mind that haemodynamics and organ blood flow do not permit conclusions with respect to functional neurologic recovery or histopathologic damage to the brain, which is very likely to be associated with hyperglycaemia.	4.103432349190139
Abstract  We present an algorithm for the rational diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type I (GA1).	2.9975101923392478
Normal urinary organic acids in patients with non-specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely, and no further investigations are required.	4.380408098251446
In other patients, the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical, neuroradiological and biochemical findings.	4.248782328773001
GCDH enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom GA1 is very likely.	3.62875659995346
This article gives a brief review of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the nineteenth century up to our own time.	3.381946618991417
Malignant lymphomas, originating from peripheral T or NK cells, are rare tumours in Europe and account for less than 10% of all malignant lymphomas.	3.559376358657038
In this review, the salient features of the more frequently occurring entities derived from T or NK cells will be presented.	2.779514581253863
Nasal NK/T cell lymphoma is mainly found in the nose and paranasal sinuses and often, but not always, display an angiocentric growth pattern leading to coagulation necrosis.	3.5195983367702053
The tumor cells consistently express CD56, CD2 and the EBER molecules encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus.	2.5971969906857635
Clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements are often absent indicating, in the majority of cases, a derivation of these tumors from NK cells.	3.6088493611306114
Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis.	4.074470998030849
The tumour cells express T cell antigens, CD103 and cytotoxic molecules, but are negative for CD4.	3.0196045125171547
Approximately 20% of the cases display CD56 mostly in combination with CD8.	4.904033777465228
Recently, an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified.	3.3729950157441375
Histologically these cases resemble celiac disease, however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent CD8 and T-cell-receptor protein expression, and, they are clonal by molecular analysis.	3.343917460984505
Clinically, the patients suffer from refractory sprue or ulcerative jejunitis.	2.9121125256710463
The prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour-forming T-cell lymphoma.	3.275873825783923
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings (atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale cytoplasm, arborizing high endothelial venules and large FDC-meshworks) as well as clinical features (systemic symptoms, signs of a dysregulated immune response).	3.350045947070681
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas, that do not fit into a distinct entity, are classified in the REAL and the new WHO classifications as peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified.	3.482262778601291
These display a broad morphological spectrum (including the T-cell lymphomas of different cell sizes, Lennert's lymphoma and T-zone lymphoma of the Kiel-classification) and in general are clinically aggressive.	3.526688665104577
Causes and courses of the diseases are subjected to a change of an increasing life expectancy on the one hand and technically highly developed medicine on the other hand.	3.4179797355304555
Since a growing number of elderly people is denying intensive medical interventions which serve the purpose of keeping them alive despite severe diseases, the problem of euthanasia imposes direct questions.	3.2645300815585037
A central role is played by the active-passive difference and its moralistic legitimacy.	3.0922138185903494
The difficulties of this difference are discussed below on the applicable level of ethical discussions.	2.8649169439309268
At the same time, knowledge of the danger is being made aware that in a maximal therapeutical orientated medical care system the desire for euthanasia may become identical with the reverse side of this care system.	3.1866958007917305
Isolated severe head trauma (SHT) or SHT in combination with multiple injuries are important factors for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the consequences of accidents.	4.339009154329285
The prognosis mainly depends on the presence of primary mechanic brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage.	3.590423702913873
Causes for the development of secondary brain damage are the intracranial space demand after traumatic injury and edema formation which may result in iscemia, as well as inflammatory processes.	3.745472240060947
Both isolated SHT and polytrauma with or without brain damage may result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which may cause a single or multiple organ failure (MOF).	3.6535544448859323
Often the organism is able to survive isolated traumatic injuries and functional disturbances, but in combination or cumulation they may be lethal.	3.754060836907005
The hypermetabolism after SHT is often regarded as an interaction between the central nervous system and the whole organism by the activation of the neuroendocrine axis.	4.073644287006371
In contrast to the consequences of SHT for the whole organism, multiple injuries after polytrauma may affect brain functions, such as the shock dependent disturbance of the brain perfusion accompanied by brain hypoxia which may lead to an aggravated prognosis.	3.477898200100696
Moreover, coagulation, metabolism and fracture healing are influenced by the onset of SIRS as well.	3.717426478409311
Our knowledge about the bidirectional inflammatory interaction between brain and whole organism is still limited.	3.52277687467561
In this context, the effects of secondary surgical interventions which may additionally stress a traumatized body have to be considered and are the subject for actual clinical discussions and experimental studies.	3.452771868737222
This article tries to summarize some important aspects on this topic.	2.870337214920439
Background: Chronic cough and thoracic pain, commonly caused by upper airway infections, are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics.	3.209635410075356
These "benign" symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders.	3.1406911989392174
Methods: In two patients (male, age 41/12 and 43/12 years) chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm (Pleuropulmonary blastoma).	3.3547950933408135
Results: Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis.	3.5069016131183606
An incomplete resection was performed in both cases.	4.577380417185842
Both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy.	3.2041660918120587
One boy died, the other one is alive and well more than 6 years after diagnosis without evidence of disease.	4.205873189961043
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy) can provide a long term remission.	3.1675566518810117
In 12 patients with systemic sclerosis the influence of hypnosis and autogenic training on the acral blood circulation and the coping with the disease was investigated in a pilot study.	3.555899594685449
In the first step significant increases in the skin temperature of the fingers (mean +/- SD: 3.9 +/- 1.2  °C) could be found after relaxation hypnosis.	3.5337377681911013
In the second step six patients (study group) gained experience with autogenic training.	2.9020811661927595
The other six patients served as control group.	2.701448601520329
In the study group, the skin temperature of the fingers (short-term effect) was significantly higher than in the control group (1.9 +/- 1.0  °C).	3.86435643853806
Long-term effects of the autogenic training (mean acral rewarning time, duration and course of the Raynaud attacks, acral lesions of the hands, psychosomatic status of complaints, type of relation to the disease as precondition for coping with the disease) were not found within the relatively short follow-up period of 4 months.	3.785251211610241
Two patients, however, reported that they could shorten the duration of Raynaud attacks by autogenic training.	3.513520244923006
In our patients heterogenicity and an increased score of multiple psychosomatic complaints were registered at the outset.	3.068966056681717
As far as the type of relation to the disease is concerned, the patients could be assessed as almost adapted.	4.125620583670764
Hypnosis and autogenic training can be recommended as complementary therapy in systemic sclerosis.	3.692865051992261
Abstract The term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea, cough, and count or purulence of sputum.	3.163027926052243
The management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management, hospital management or intensive care treatment.	3.2517589207917155
Cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors.	3.9180981921716924
The first-line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug-treatment with 2-agonists and anticholinergics.	3.6693120346231716
Systemic steroids as a short-term course are advocated if hospital-treatment is necessary.	4.014908120449737
Infections of the respiratory tract are a frequent cause of acute exacerbations.	4.492615218237136
However, a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state.	3.7582281956090724
Antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present.	3.2248248095065564
The severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms.	3.9235176837522983
Noninvasive ventilation in severe exacerbation is able to improve gas-exchange and to reduce the work of breathing.	3.8825300738340833
As a consequence the number of intubations and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced.	3.5269920241382975
Background: In 1986 Prof. H. Olbing (University of Essen Pediatrics Department), supported by Prof. G. Stickler (Mayo Medical School, Minnesota), introduced a 4-weeks clinical skills lab for all students (annual class 250), based on self-instruction by means of computer-assisted, interactive, audiovisual learning materials, models, bedside teaching and seminars on special topics (partially peer-guided).	2.82937387949569
Each year 14 chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching.	3.3199381431391557
The peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills.	3.008073629380707
Each tutor is active during 4-5 skills lab periods, and in each period he/she coaches two groups of two students each.	3.446753745388273
During the bedside teaching phase each group examines and presents four patients.	2.9003795600464217
Spinal injuries referring to banal falls are common injuries in elderly persons.	3.321530524827416
Up to 55 years of age spinal fractures are more frequent in men while its opposite in older persons.	3.582203151660375
There are two typical lesions: odontoid fracture in the upper cervical spine and compression fracture in thoracolumbar spine.	3.176588816010286
Odontoid fracture is the most frequent lesion in cervical spine in the elderly.	4.3949878152531365
This is caused by trabecular structure of dens axis and spine's stiffness in old age.	2.8114943594606787
Instable fractures in extension type II are most common.	3.7114294492392106
In many cases the instability of the lesion is hidden and can be first seen in functional examination controlled by x-ray.	3.3700498496544005
Conservative treatment is efficient in stable lesions type III while there is a high risk for pseudarthrosis in treatment of instable lesions in elderly with Halo Fixateur e. g. We think that the best operation for these fractures is the anterior screw fixation.	3.3449407935938216
If this is not sufficient because of low bone mass or early dislocation of the screws a dorsal fusion C1/C2 with transarticular screwing e. g. should be done.	3.3715499392914734
Because of rare symptoms thoracolumbar fractures in osteoporosis are hidden frequently.	3.011253021772287
In many cases it's not easy to distinguish acute lesions from healed fractures or tumor lesions.	2.7815950929596904
Therefore there are just few compression fractures (A type) that have to be treated operatively.	3.8221103858351233
Instable lesions type B and C must be operated as well in the elderly as in the young.	4.335623936236185
Because of low bone mass in elderly the dorsal instrumentation should include more than just the two injured segments.	3.0119455215375224
An even more adequate stabilisation is done with an additional vertebral replacement.	3.162047640348271
Following curative minimal-invasive laser resection of T1-T3 laryngeal carcinomas, patients were subjected to an intensive voice rehabilitation.	3.3230565311411087
Therapy was effected twice a day for approximately 2 months, utilizing the concept of functional voice therapy.	3.4430882911063203
Before and after rehabilitation, acoustic analyses were made by using two different computer-supported measuring systems: (1) the "multidimensional voice program" (Kay Elementrics Corp.) and (2) a novel software program developed in Göttingen that includes a new voice quality parameter based on correlations between frequency bands.	3.075193677976388
Acoustic analyses showed superiority of the glottal versus supraglottal compensatory phonation.	3.1797749449128205
Findings showed that not all acoustic parameters equally documented voice improvement after rehabilitation.	3.1105356339430412
The standard deviation of fundamental frequency was the only parameter showing a significant post-therapeutic improvement.	3.1012811278977037
A further suitable acoustic method proved to be the voice quality parameter that has been newly introduced by us.	3.674699682024077
In contrast to analogous parameters of other methods, this approach is independent of the exact periodicity of the glottal excitation function, thus permitting reliable results to be obtained even with aphonic or heavily dysphonic voices.	2.9663864490227874
Aseptic pseudarthrosis may occur after all kinds of traumatology treatment.	3.5707550973948337
Following conservative treatment, incomplete immobilisation or an unattached bone fragment can be causal.	2.7674294649013467
After plate osteosynthesis the biomechanical principles are not efficient or the circulatory damage delays healing.	3.176800133194756
There are two broad types of pseudarthrosis: vascular and nonvascular.	2.8061807340357503
The extent of vascularisation can be demonstrated by bone scintigraphy as well as X-ray.	3.756816244008898
The treatment of vascular nonunions is very common.	3.0486427740961752
Mechanical stability is required, therefore a new osteosynthesis is desirable.	3.625003369542892
Osteoporosis caused by inactivity and dislocation increases the rate of complications.	3.425185300015137
Much more difficult problems are encountered in treatment of unreactive and avital pseudarthrosis, particularly in cases with a defect of bone substance.	4.122570613059743
These defects can be treated with a segment transfer and a fibula-to-tibia operation.	4.015601431831875
Extracorporal lithotripsy has been established as a new method in treatment of active and vascular nonunions.	4.084218955587749
Former osteosynthesis is not a contraindication.	4.584677830631559
Stability and immobilisation are necessary.	3.597828650140218
Treatment in the low-frequency magnetic field shows no effect.	3.247203233869148
Correct biomechanical and biological osteosynthesis with proper attention paid to location, quality of bone and asepsis can avoid the development of a pseudarthrosis.	3.71380594796821
Background: Although the majority of surgeons regard Hartmann's operation as therapeutic standard in perforations of the colon complicated by peritonitis this procedure has been critically discussed in recent years.	3.3433817295876613
Advocates of one-stage techniques criticized bad postoperative results (high morbidity and mortality) and long-term outcome (low rates of intestinal restoration).	3.8355946564556596
The aim of our study was to investigate whether the late results after Hartmann's operation justify this criticism.	2.5803804576590257
Method: From 1982 to 1997 Hartmann's operations were performed in 103 patients for colonic perforations.	3.4522180777399734
In 63 % of cases inflammatory diseases caused colonic complications.	3.222363558353215
The average Mannheimer Peritonitis Index (MPI) was 19.	2.8850296795994486
Seventeen patients died postoperatively (mortality: 16.5 %).	3.173445924813793
In 69 patients (80 %) intestinal restoration could be performed after an average interval of 122 days (complication rate: 6 %, no mortality).	3.4811980172234502
On follow-up, patients were asked to give information on their general state, changes of housing, abdominal complaints, and quality of life.	3.5281945191729234
Results: Data on 93 % of patients could be obtained.	3.3337621286674866
The median follow-up time was 75 months.	3.087685848293155
Eleven patients had died; the remaining 72 were investigated.	3.3371430477798194
86 % described the quality of their lives as good or very good; only 11 % indicated severe loss of activity.	2.8546131259890797
Quality of life did not differ between patients in whom intestinal continuity had been restored and those in whom it had not been restored.	3.3122499991819114
Anastomotic strictures developed in 7 % of cases, always after stapled anastomosis.	3.9375450061400707
Conclusions: According to our results, long-term outcome after Hartmann's operation is good.	4.038349277158095
A great majority of patients indicated the quality of their lives as good or very good: this assessment was not dependent on restoration of intestinal continuity.	3.0491539122610427
Tibial torsion defects are usually not clinically evident and, hence, are often overlooked.	3.4393237465904893
Clinical examination and CT scan have proved to be the best ways of measuring static tibial torsion, whereas dynamic measurements are usually performed in the clinic and the "gait laboratory."	3.634619645713352
Only few studies have determined there to be a connection between a torsion defect in the lower leg and expected pathological conditions of the knee and ankle joints.	3.951846256450971
However, patellofemoral instability, Osgood-Schlatter disease, osteochondrosis dissecans are increasingly being found in cases of increased external tibial torsion and arthrosis in reduced torsion.	3.189777667364935
The next step was to ascertain what proportion of them are in need of psychotherapy.	3.34790976727465
Using the standardized Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), 146 men and 32 women were interviewed.	2.815277140920499
The results according to the DSM-III demonstrated high lifelong and 6-month prevalence of psychic disturbances.	3.5494337042401303
Medical and social services were often enjoyed, but mostly over a short period of time in particularly critical situations.	3.1874220373710638
Women were treated more often than men.	3.4470354518284987
Elements such as age and level of education hardly influenced patients' seeking help.	3.3931768898990313
Despite a high prevalence of addictive disease, alcohol and drug clinics were rarely consulted.	3.2162476364643395
The increase in the number of diagnoses was paralleled by an increase in the number of patients seeking help.	3.3386519974690154
Most treatments involved schizophrenia and anxiety.	3.359316227333464
By means of logistic regression models, predictors of the extent to which these services were used were analysed.	3.1629904933001924
Continued treatment occurs only rarely.	3.29699798612133
Electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics are currently used as diagnostic criteria for the long QT-syndrome.	3.769090241263952
In borderline electrocardiographic findings associated with unclear syncope, it is often difficult to ensure or exclude long QT-syndrome.	3.4613540426165224
Schwartz and coworkers therefore created a point system as a guide in clinical decision making.	3.020968847698226
In recent years genetic diagnostics have entered the arena of long-QT assessment.	3.0876006312796704
Aside from new insights into the pathophysiology of the long QT-disorder, it is expected that genetic diagnostics will offer substantial help to ascertain long QT-syndrome in patients with borderline electrocardiographic and clinical findings and improve risk stratification in long-QT family members.	4.118257509400535
Performing linkage analysis, coupling of autosomal-dominant congenital long QT-syndrome (Romano-Ward Syndrome) to chromosomes 11 (LQT1/11p15.5), 3 (LQT3/3p21), 7 (LQT2/7q35), and 4 (LQT4/4q25-27) was demonstrated.	3.283908316158537
More recently, the disease genes in long QT-syndrome 1, 2, and 3 could be identified.	3.8874348017837836
Analysis of the base-pair sequence allowed detection of several different mutations in different families illustrating genetic heterogeneity.	2.884413694471113
Aside from diagnostic aspects, molecular genetics may also guide pharmacological therapy by identifying the specific ion-channel disorder leading to QT-prolongation and sudden death.	2.7080427528194604
During the past 4 years we have demonstrated in eyes with corneal pathology that applanation tonometry (Goldmann, Perkins) generally delivers falsely low measurements in comparison to intraocular needle tonometry.	2.830693679110824
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether impression tonometry (Schioetz) is more precise than applanation tonometry in determinating the intraocular pressure in eyes with corneal disorders.	2.4708261302945926
The case of a 24-year-old woman with a plunging ranula is reported.	3.2374635056555
Primarily, the patient noticed extensive swelling of the neck, which had developed 3 months previously.	4.499852922340751
The polycystic, firmly attached tumor and the sublingual and submandibular glands of the right side of the neck were surgically removed.	3.619036174614368
Pathological examination showed a retention cyst by means of a plunging ranula.	3.505971342991137
The etiology, pathogenesis, clinical aspect and diagnostic procedures for the plunging ranula are described.	3.175479359096243
We prefer surgical treatment with a histological examination to verify the diagnosis.	4.0619870477975
The plunging ranula originates on the sublingual gland; therefore, its simultaneous extirpation is recommended to avoid recurrences.	2.9624710523685427
In extensive cases, the additional removal of the submandibular gland can be advised.	3.6420741200107773
Cranial dural fistulae are rare; when they occur, it is usually difficult to detect them at an early stage.	3.9879701734155923
With a view to the question of possible progress in diagnosis we now report on seven patients with lateral dural fistulae fed by branches of the external carotid artery.	3.2311637689061463
The examination was carried out before selective arteriography using cw-Doppler sonography and colour coded duplex sonography in combination.	3.3240178291991556
Sonographic criteria for detection of hyperperfusion take account of flow velocity as well as pulsatility.	4.0484868796247495
In all cases hyperperfusion of the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery was detected.	3.433917847789867
In most of these cases pathologic findings were also observed at the occipital artery, and more rarely in the contralateral external carotid artery or the ipsilateral vertebral artery, in addition.	3.7862023560934013
A possible source of error arising from confusion of blood vessels was present with the cw-Doppler sonography, but not for colour coded duplex sonography.	3.292399678463277
Therefore, cranial dural fistulae characterized by a high shunt volume can be diagnosed correctly by indirect Doppler sonographic criteria using cw-Doppler and duplex sonography.	3.184558700426397
Direct visualization of the fistula and its nidus requires additional selective arteriography, in the course of which endovascular embolization may be performed.	4.12776464793796
Background: Echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease.	3.651861933254538
The good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects.	3.931231313750079
Dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant jets are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies.	3.166987089004636
According to the German Federal Bureau of Statistics, in 1998 nearly 213,000 persons died due to malignant cancer.	2.785158004330754
Cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all.	3.447931332684223
Pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family.	3.8128945732666724
Although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy, in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians.	3.5880672763901127
This work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine.	3.4012471722515003
This retrospective study shows the results in 30 patients of revision surgery on their reruptured ACL.	3.4357227478796677
The follow-up time was 30 months on average (range 10 - 54 months).	2.944596781238855
The follow-up examination included subjective (Lysholm score, Tegner activity level rating score), clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer.	3.104904498402505
The overall evaluation was done according to the IKDC score.	3.4703597816225975
The follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on ACL.	3.2210890909679755
The IKDC score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results, which demonstrated that revision ACL surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery.	2.8185410626195866
Nevertheless, we recommend reconstruction of a torn ACL even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration.	3.336568105932035
Nowadays, restorative proctocolectomy is considered the "gold standard" in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis.	3.6329225637820826
Alternative procedures such as Brooke ileostomy or Kock pouch are limited to special indications.	3.165521354844031
Preservation of function is the decisive advantage of the ileoanal pouch, but preservation of function is not equal to quality of life.	3.308074074517911
Quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to define and measure.	2.8939791187765556
Quality of life can only be assessed by standardized and validated quality-of-life questionnaires.	3.5965549821907996
Preoperatively, patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted quality of life, depending on the intensity of their disease.	3.722535734414582
Proctocolectomy is the curative therapy and improves quality of life.	3.27084462547406
When evaluating quality of life it is not essential if patients are treated by Brooke ileostomy or restorative proctocolectomy.	3.884932194951498
The advantage of restorative proctocolectomy is the improvement in some aspects such as sexuality and physical acticity.	3.1894675761609115
The "Total Quality-of-Life Index" is not impoved.	3.5116185012572383
Preoperatively, patients should be informed that preservation of function by restorative proctocolectomy is accompanied by an increased postoperative morbidity in comparison to other procedures.	3.6069226207607343
Decreased quality-of-life results when complications occur postoperatively that cannot be controlled over a long period of time.	3.261836029474784
In some cases excision of the ileoanal pouch may be the most sensible way of solving the problems.	3.6756679851112506
On the other hand, patients without complications and good function after ileoanal pouch procedure may achieve a quality of life comparable to that of healthy controls.	3.185725914923045
Preoperatively, patients should be aware of this risk-benefit relationship and should share the responsibility of the decision for or against restorative proctocolectomy.	3.009114976928104
The objective of this investigation was the experimental determination of the contact pressures in the hip joint for characteristic phases of the gait cycle.	3.449459440293451
The joint forces determined in vivo with telemetric endoprosthesis by Bergmann et al.	2.7286143702970667
(1993) were converted into a pelvic reference system, based on kinematic gait analysis.	3.410123932519652
In eight cadaveric hip joints (age 18-75 yrs.)	3.193161758800671
the reaction forces were applied corresponding to four phases of the gait cycle (heel strike, mid-stance, heel off, toe off) and the pressure distribution determined with FUJI pressure sensitive film.	3.0199744546578517
We found maxima of 10 MPa during mid stance.	2.9745898538253113
The areas of highest pressure were located in the ventro-superior aspect of the acetabulum (anterior part of the acetabular roof) and in the dorso-inferior aspect of the lunate surface.	4.396153641006421
The pressure distribution was relatively constant during the four phases and the maxima did not vary proportional to the applied load.	2.9214781194910966
The normal pressure distribution in the hip appears to be determined by the physiological incongruity of the articular surfaces and the inhomogeneous bony support of the acetabulum.	4.4957374431060595
During operative interventions this normal load transfer should be restored as accurately as possible.	2.690189632925447
In spite of its serious sequelae, volatile substance abuse (VSA) attracts very little public attention in Germany.	2.6978833964572693
Initially, he achieved short-lived euphoria and hallucinations.	2.8198402016298703
He compensated for the developing tolerance by increasing the dosage, finally consuming 5 litres of fluid propane daily.	2.9770345094084925
Getting such quantities was facilitated by his occupational access to propane.	3.094064815512244
Since he abused the propane in an apartment house, he also exposed third parties to the danger of explosion.	2.8644776802863072
Clinical examination revealed disturbances in orientation, restricted perceptivity and concentration, reduced mnemonic performance, and psychomotor agitation.	2.9183783813513244
All these symptoms diminished during a 6-month follow-up.	3.1909671086617877
The relationship of his organic mental disorder to the abuse of propane was not clear, since he had also abused alcohol.	2.9321777268157634
Objectives The Marburg external patellotibial (Mpt) fixator is designed to temporarily protect a reconstructed distal extensor apparatus of the knee.	2.7833112260005723
It allows an early functional aftercare.	2.8877231136588177
The indications or ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary disorders are described.	3.579118889526482
Clinical applications are several lung diseases in adults and especially in children.	3.6340318350493575
Sonography provides important additional information to chest X-ray and is even superior to CT under special circumstances.	3.5234859423196934
Pulmonary sonography is a useful link between conventional X-ray and more expensive cross-sectional imaging.	4.104630079204045
In the evaluation of pulmonary diseases at present the potential of ultrasound is not optimally used.	4.004060980731426
Traditionally oral surgeons and dentists have evaluated the jaws using intraoral films and panoramic radiographs.	2.94015394386178
The involvement of radiologists has been limited.	3.309292375807438
The complex anatomy is described and identified on human skulls and on axial, panoramic, and cross-sectional images.	3.3230207104206895
With this anatomic description Dental-CT-scans are used to demonstrate the anatomy of maxilla and the mandible.	3.7632428193400114
An overview of the technique of Dental-CT is provided, furthermore the radiation dose of different organs is explained.	3.5659550732887904
Suggestions to reduce these doses by simple modifications of the recommended procols are given.	3.1054516134366126
The debate on passive and active euthanasia has met a controversial echo both in the German-speaking media and in professional publications within recent years.	3.146440691986426
This discussion, however, largely excluded mentally ill  patients.	4.2380272351538055
Also, euthanasia advocacy groups have usually distanced themselves from  euthanasia in psychiatric patients.	2.7613227161910605
We report here two cases from our hospital in which in-patients with affective disorders committed assisted suicide during a hospital pass.	3.2815800621798243
We discuss these events under the assumption that these are cases of questionable active euthanasia in mentally ill patients whose judgement was considerably compromised by their disorder.	3.172777932194641
Definition of the problem: In Germany, the dissection rate of the deceased is distinctly lower than in many other European countries.	3.511306336152052
Although critics of autopsies use to put forward ethical objections and religious scruples, neither the Christian church nor piety stand opposite to the practise of autopsies.	2.686956031839811
Currently undergoing a clinical trial a new miniaturized monoplane ultrasound probe potentially enhances the practicability of perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) without loss of echocardiographic quality.	2.916942788553179
Methods: In the present prospective study, the nasally inserted miniaturized TEE probe was tested in 12 ventilated patients and compared with a conventional TEE probe.	4.419310825715198
Echocardiographic quality was tested by two independent investigators by analyzing the percentage of the endocardium contour detection (<50%, 50-75%, 75-100%) in the left ventricular short- and long-axis views.	4.160497481013541
Results: In 11 patients, more than 50% of endocardium were visualized continuously with both probes.	3.224140105448385
Although the nasal TEE probe was inferior to conventional TEE in detecting lateral endocardium, automated endocardium detection compared well with both methods.	2.9664855055838855
Inter- and intraobserver variability in manual measurements of the left ventricular cross-sectional area was below 5% on average and differed non-significantly with regard to the method.	3.8702602208435963
In 2 patients, continuous monitoring was aggravated by repeated loss of contact between the miniaturized TEE probe and mucosa.	2.9051118372944744
Conclusions: In comparison with conventional TEE, the miniaturized TEE probe provides practicability advantages without significant loss of information for cardiovascular monitoring.	3.3046514255450847
By means of modern color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) even very small vessels can be visualized.	2.760296316093507
Maximum resolution nowadays is about 0.5 mm diameter of the vessel.	4.05715047424032
We compared the use of CCDS and angiography in studying of acral perfusion.	3.6091098215442408
Besides morphologic criteria, hemodynamic criteria were recorded.	3.230978699701041
Arteries in healthy fingers appear as long and straight vessels with a clearly defined border.	3.1548033681910836
The physiological maximal blood flow velocity exceded 20 cm/s.	3.075233738506866
CCDS revealed tortuosity of finger arteries as typical finding in thrombangiitis obliterans.	2.968834803331226
CCDS is suitable for evaluation of acral perfusion in patients suffering from secondary Raynaud's syndrome.	4.0460754921535536
Apart from diagnosis of disturbed acral circulation, other possible applications of CCDS are in in the surgical field, for example replantations in hand or finger surgery.	3.300404261836624
The discussion of the Osheroff vs Chestnut Lodge court case in the "American Journal of Psychiatry" raised the question whether individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is the appropriate treatment for severe depression.	3.2262630576384863
A summary of the crucial points and a review of the clinical and scientific implications of this case is presented.	4.088132645841316
In addition, the difference between psychiatrists and psychotherapists regarding the assessment of depressive disorders is examined by analysing results of the ICD-10 research criteria study.	3.5474255040232903
In the case of one patient with dysthymia (ICD-10 RC: F34.1) psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists.	3.0226138597397
By contrast, the percentage of clinicians suspecting an endogenous etiology and thus, diagnosing a psychosis and starting a psychopharmacotherapy was markedly higher among psychiatrists.	2.928852255612369
In conclusion, the integration of different conceptualizations and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists.	3.1937477577222273
A 43-year-old patient was admitted for severe claudicatio in his right leg, doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery.	3.275303408724962
Using the cross-over-approach from the contralateral side, it was possible to navigate a guide wire through the occlusion, and after passage with an excimer laser an ipsilateral retrograde puncture with placement of a sheath was performed.	3.173792534370143
In order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation, a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique.	3.6652791081394924
Afterwards three stents were placed.	3.6949885101937645
Subsequently the patient completely improved; treadmill exercise test and duplex sonography showed good results.	3.0540954335875075
Conclusion: Using the kissing balloon technique, laser-assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments.	2.9005646515158334
A surgical procedure can thus be avoided.	3.1726529196125406
The typical MRI features of the most common pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, have been established.	4.982875734264072
However, even in these common pancreatic disorders, MRI correlation with the underlying pathology is limited for clinical reasons.	3.4820832787862024
We emphasize MR-pathological correlation of inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic changes, including pancreatitis, adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, rare cystic and solid pancreatic neoplasms, and islet cell tumors.	3.1462949377918648
By highlighting the correlation of key pathological features with MR findings, a better understanding of the MR appearance of pancreatic pathology can be provided.	3.4484019015642478
In addition, MRI may prove a powerful tool in detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors.	2.8636039473277672
Background: The implantation of a femoro-popliteal bypass graft represents the gold standard in the management of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease in the femoro-popliteal region.	3.2752797110887193
Application of interventional techniques has permitted the development of a novel, endovascular implantable bypass system.	3.342743427323408
The device is placed within the lumen of the superficial femoral artery.	2.8564253445762953
The present study investigated the technical properties of the new system in cadavers, with subsequent evaluation of its application in humans.	3.387903899057365
Methods: The endopass consists of a thin-wall polycarbourethane tube with a total length of 53 cm.	3.3798331077102817
The distal end is connected with a self-expanding stent prothesis 4 cm in length.	3.1980098127796794
Endovascular implantation is performed through a groin incision.	3.352819589771608
Following antegrade ringstripper-TEA, the endopass is introduced into the femoral artery after placement of a guide wire.	3.744250435707674
The proximal anastomosis is performed surgically.	3.1598742973677196
Results: The technical requirements and feasibility of the system were tested on 12 cadaver extremities.	3.5547305807236524
Implantation of the device proved technically successful in seven of eight extremities with significant occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.	3.3146222689327915
The most important problems included the complete ringstripper-TEA, the placement of the guide wire following the TEA, and the expansion of the endopass.	3.3092052264840905
Following approval by the ethics commission, the endopass was implanted in five patients between June 1997 and March 1998.	3.53658345580247
In three patients, the endopass remained patent and has functioned well.	3.6633124696568036
One patient with poor vascular outflow suffered an early noncorrectable occlusion, while in the remaining case, perforation secondary to the ringstripper procedure forced us to abandon the attempt.	3.0432876331126146
Conclusion: Experience from the cadaver study and initial human applications confirm the feasibility of this method.	3.516899920405845
Further development and methodological improvement, however, are necessary requiring additional, larger studies on patients.	3.6794634056377697
Introduction: There is no data available on the action of etomidate on ion currents in human neuronal cells.	3.7399928586343236
Therefore the effects of etomidate on a human neuronal delayed rectifer potassium current were investigated.	3.3076074750534796
In order to evaluate patients' exposure to radiation in computed tomography, dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and dose free in air on the axis of rotation are used.	2.8706544161929717
The CTDI and the MSAD, derivable from the CTDI, are a good measure for the absorbed doses in the examined volume, but they do not take the biological sensitivity of the organs into account and do not describe the radiogenic risk that is actually relevant for patients and doctors.	3.2940958826412756
The dose on the axis of rotation is not an accurate measure of the effective dose and the radiogenic risk.	3.297867957925462
The declaration of a limit for the dose on the axis of rotation should take the different regions into account, in order to guarantee acceptable image quality on one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other side.	3.659779865655347
As physical dose quantities, the CTDI, MSAD and dose on the axis of rotation are useful to characterize and differentiate between programs and systems concerning radiation exposure.	2.690091111502244
Prognosis of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction has substantially improved over the last two decades.	3.875186009830409
However, stratification of patients at risk for death due to arrhythmic events remains a clinical challenge.	3.399319974731031
Due to the important role of the autonomic nervous system in the genesis of sudden death, autonomic markers such as heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity have recently gained attention as risk stratification parameters.	3.4332019557634967
The present study reports the results of noninvasive risk stratification in 411 consecutive postinfarction patients treated due to contemporary therapeutical guidelines with a high proportion of patients discharged with a patent infarct related artery.	3.2803306074681435
The diagnostic arsenal of risk parameters comprised heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and more traditional markers such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular late potentials.	3.278674867337986
Patiens were followed for a mean of 33  +/- 21 months.	4.2070723440055415
Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular function, both autonomic markers, and the patency of the infarct related artery were independent predictors of the prospectively defined primary study endpoint, i.e., all-cause mortality plus ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	3.258669922873037
With respect to the secondary endpoint (ventricular tachyarrhythmic events), left ventricular function, heart rate variability, and infarct vessel patency were independent predictors.	3.3030099027833986
Ventricular late potentials and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia had no predictive value with respect to ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	3.4490153008040485
These findings from a large prospective long-term study demonstrate the value of markers of cardiac autonomic tone in identifying infarct survivors at risk for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	3.4072413143636946
K+ Channels and Cardiotoxicity of Drugs: Implications for Drug Toxicity Assessment - The time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the QT interval of the ECG and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK), which consists of a rapid component (IKr) and a slow component (IKs).	3.459209968763374
Prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer QT interval on the ECG.	3.1634143214484323
During prolonged APs, increased inward currents induce early afterdepolarizations, which increase the risk of Torsades de pointes (TdP) cardiac arrhythmias.	2.9475884001057815
TdP arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent twisting of the electrical axis around the isoelectric line.	3.307711220955773
It has a rate of 150 to 250 beats/min and it can occasionally degenerate into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal.	3.546118751385486
The incidence of drug-induced TdP arrhythmias is highest among class IA and class III antiarrhythmic agents.	3.03149118655596
However, under certain clinical conditions, also several non-cardiovascular medicinal products induce QT interval prolongations in the ECG or TdP arrhythmias.	2.7854151630578206
Since all drugs known to cause TdP block IKr, an early evaluation of possible effects on APs of cardiac myocytes expressing IKr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended.	3.230254157378793
If in-vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce AP prolongation and/or K+ channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations,  either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to TdP arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies.	3.6703900546728456
Carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of ominous prognosis if not adequately treated.	3.4754647425262397
To a large extent the probability of positive lymph nodes is determined by the grade of the primary lesion.	4.364508370057936
In turn the number of positive nodes greatly influences the survival.	3.73163767315052
In the past the complications of radical ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy have decreased their timely indication.	2.837732773047648
If delayed lymphadenectomy is performed, the survival rate is reduced by approximately 50 % as compared to the results of immediate lymphadenectomy.	4.40815602502615
The modified inguinal lymphadenectomy described by Catalona leads to less complications.	2.888993332752736
If performed without delay it should lead to improved survival in patients with higher stage and high grade penile cancer.	3.949089735501341
Recently suggested employment of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherpy may further enhance the survival.	2.991327781249313
On the basis of existing models for psychodynamic diagnostic evaluation and psychoanalytic interview technique and of the theoretical concepts of the 5 axes of the OPD diagnosis, a new type of the psychodynamic assessment interview is presented.	3.395612347982975
The examination is structured in 5 phases: the opening scene, exploration of specific examples for relationships, exploration of experience of self and others, of therapy motivation, and finally clarifying the preconditions for treatment and the ability for insight.	3.3513885104515238
The syndrome diagnosis according to ICD 10 is completed in a final phase.	3.1771985203404296
This psychodynamic-diagnostic assessment interview is recommended, apart from the use for OPD diagnosis, for use a clinical instrument.	3.5492179045834518
Cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most frequent forms of meningoencephalitis in AIDS patients.	3.527704677273957
Before the introduction of triazol antibiotics like difluconazole, the frequency of this meningitis among AIDS patients was 5-10%, yet declined during the last years.	3.6580507587602997
Clinically, nonspecific signs of a meningeal inflammation predominate while focal neurological signs are rare.	3.2267169136137412
Rapid institution of high-dose antimycotic therapy is the keystone to improve prognosis and decrease mortality.	3.933862508760098
Antimycotics of choice are amphotericin B, fluconazole, and flucytosin.	3.550419406439019
Diagnosis is established by detection of cryptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid, microscopic demonstration of cryptococci using India-ink, and cryptococcal cultures.	2.6596843273999737
Recent developments aim to improve antimycotic therapies.	3.210490905822866
During the last years, life-long secondary prevention with difluconazole was established.	2.8952319668374025
Cryptococci which are resistent against fluconazole and amphotericin B are a special challenge, yet fortunately are rare.	3.0295474597813574
Longterm outcome of patients is determined by the progression of the underlying immunsuppression.	4.89233951018733
Clinical decision analysis in patients with suspected cryptococcal meningitis is presented using methods from evidence-based medicine.	3.664556827253546
The effect of aprotinin (2000000 IU as a bolus +500000 JU/h until the end of the operation) on transfusion requirements and coagulation parameters in orthotopic liver transplantation (study group: n=9; placebo group: n=9) was investigated in a randomised, double-blind study.	3.288237569231831
Coagulation parameters were monitored intraoperatively using a mobile laboratory.	3.4330029702605276
In contrast to the published results, no effect on transfusion requirements could be demonstrated.	3.118646269498513
However, aprotinin showed a positive effect on some coagulation parameters in the reperfusion phase.	3.52179169457021
The mechanism appeared to be inhibition of the contact activation of the intrinsic system with less thrombin generation in the study group.	3.9151552566608094
Co-existing inflammation and epidermal hyperproliferation characteristic for psoriasis have been shown to be reproducible in several animal models utilizing a variety of different strategies.These models highlight some points of the multicausal pathogenesis of psoriasis.	3.1745995313799003
Based on observations made in the animal models, a hypothesis is proposed for the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the elements of which can be tested in a recently established xenogeneic transplantation model.	3.99541299058237
Adipose tissue tumors are often characterized by typical or even specific chromosomal alterations.	3.2907655644761076
In some of the cases the molecular background of these microscopically visible alterations was already elucidated.	3.057089089305074
In myxoid liposarcomas the translocation t(12;16) creates a fusion gene between the CHOP gene and the FUS gene and in lipomas the HMGI-C gene becomes rearrranged by structural aberrations involving chromosomal region 12q14-15.	2.6447340201351732
Based on examples of a lipoma, a well-differentiated liposarcoma, a myxoid liposarcoma, and an aggressive angiomyxoma it is demonstrated in the present paper how cytogenetic investigation can be used as an additional tool for an improved diagnosis of adipose tissue tumors.	3.9981173709111673
Furthermore, the detection of molecular mechanisms underlying the visible cytogenetic alterations will certainly significantly increase our knowledge about the pathogenesis of these diseases.	3.856163687221587
The primary goal of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is analysis of submucosal structures that are not visible by clinical or endoscopic means.	3.6934725240872135
Therefore, image analysis of the larynx should only be performed under knowledge of the results of clinical diagnosis.	5.3071313566104745
The anatomic relationships of the laryngeal skeleton, the intrinsic structures, and the surrounding soft tissue are presented synoptically.	4.119064894916467
The pattern ERG (PERG) is used as an indicator of retinal ganglion cell function.	3.378009317714613
Up to now, reports on the reproducibility of the PERG have been contradictory.	2.8011838284396604
We investigated the reproducibility under the conditions of the forthcoming ISCEV guidelines for the PERG.	3.2793766184125746
We simultaneously recorded the PERG and VEP in 42 eyes of 21 subjects to phase-reversing checkerboard stimuli with DTL electrodes.	2.73707416385949
Both transient (2 rps) and steady-state (16 rps) stimulation was employed.	3.108184211998378
The check sizes were 0.4 °, 0.8 ° and 16 °, the mean luminance 45 cd/m2, the contrast 98%, and the field size 32 °x27 °.	3.803050487361514
Measurements were repeated at the same time of day after 1 week.	3.855819479131174
In addition, we compared two different electrode positions in 16 eyes: (1) across the cornea along the lower lid; and deep in the conjunctival sac.	3.2072014302350422
With position (1) the amplitudes were found to be higher by 20% than (2).	4.777749996325414
We calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of amplitude as a measure of reproducibility.	3.0759710415197246
CV was 7 +/- 1% for the steady-state PERG, 9 +/- 1% for the transient PERG, 12 +/- 2% for the steady-state VEP and 14 +/- 3% for the transient VEP.	4.004516158552694
For the latency of the PERG, the intersession CV was found to be 1.5%.	3.642665579460279
Amplitude reproducibility was somewhat higher under steady-state as compared to transient stimulation; we attribute this to the high noise rejection of the Fourier analysis.	3.4904533556828734
Altogether, the amplitude reproducibility of the PERG is somewhat higher than that of the VEP.	3.219503432405665
As a result of physical violence to exposed regions of skin (beating, grabbing) it was possible to effect a mutual transfer of epithelial cells between probands.	2.751550138002052
The majority of these cells were corneocytes with a minimal incidence of nucleated stratum granulosum cells.	2.929712853803212
Punching onto foil-covered sandbags resulted in a comparable transfer of cells.	3.4188446100617513
The DNA did not only originate from the few nucleated cells but also from the corneocytes themselves, as positively confirmed by investigations of denucleated cell-suspensions.	2.792579691432391
The cell concentration achieved in model experiments, however, shows that the forensic value of such a sample is dependent on the presence of nucleated cells.	4.402253259324312
The results of this paper justify the requirement - (having weighed up the appropriate case-specific modalities) - that sampling by taking swabs of the skin regions in question must be carried out as soon as possible.	3.1019264742273864
Ultrasound contrast media increase backscatter from blood thus improving the signal-to-noise-ratio.	3.353499857683512
Potential clinical applications of intravenous ultrasound contrast are reviewed.	3.2198863485253164
Contrast enhancement of continous wave Doppler is indicated when the native recordings are noisy and no complete envelope of the Doppler spectrum is obtained.	2.8928305606537044
In aortic stenosis several investigations showed good agreement between the gradient calculated from Doppler measurements and the results of cardiac catheterization.	3.516163227377003
In mitral insufficiency maximum area of the regurgitant jet is a widely used parameter for estimation of the severity of the regurgitation.	3.635755642626297
However, assessment of the maximum jet area may be not possible because poor acoustic windows.	3.2559629373286136
Contrast enhancement provides complete display of the regurgitant jet in most of the patients.	3.2302864243848703
Therefore contrast enhanced transthoracic Doppler is an alternative to transesophageal Doppler investigation in patients with poor transthoracic windows.	4.096548961867907
Since 1993 a report card system for fractures of the neck of the femur has been established in the Department of External Quality Assurance of the Chamber of Physicians of Westphalia-Lippe.	3.1832091006501737
Several indicators of good quality have changed significantly since then: conservative treatment decreased from 6.8 % in 1993 to 4.2 % in 1997, lethality decreased from 6.9 % to 5.4 %, average length of stay decreased from 30.9 days to 24.9 days, average length of stay before operation decreased from 2.6 to 2.1 days, the frequency of operations on weekends increased, complications in wound healing increased from 4.9 to 6.0 %, and cardiopulmonary complications decreased from 11.2 % to 7.8 %.	2.966678506292619
Between 1993 and 1997, 54.3 % were dismissed to go home; the percentage of patients sent to rehabilitation facilities after acute care rose from 8.3 % in 1993 to 20.1 % in 1997.	2.919422194428453
The most frequent and still increasing procedure was implantation of hemiprosthesis/bipolar prosthesis (from 38.8 % in 1993 to 41.0 % in 1997) followed by total hip replacement (decreasing from 37.4 % in 1993 to 34.2 % in 1997).	2.92545147506056
Operative treatment was performed in more than 90 % of all fractures in all counties of Westphalia-Lippe.	3.3664081265389205
However, there was a wide and significant geographical variation in the choice between osteosynthesis and hip replacement: the percentage of hip replacements differed between 57 % and 82 % among different counties.	2.9831491727659825
Average length of stay before the operative procedure for patients undergoing reduction and rigid internal fixation of the fracture is still too long (1.6 days in 1997).	3.6500494278584386
The etiology of os odontoideum is still controversial.	2.8001609123956817
In most patients, it is found by accident because of neurological symptoms and/or painful range of motion of the cervical spine.	3.8907972587921305
Upon recognition of the os odontoideum, it is unknown whether or not immediate surgery is beneficial.	4.362103073652081
This is in contrast to an "unstable" os odontoideum, which could result in atlantoaxial instability or compression of the myelon.	3.7591713232870383
In all four cases, a C1-2 fusion was performed (3 x Magerl/Seemann, 1 Gallie-Brooks).	3.158750050209876
Postoperatively, we found a complete regression of neurological symptoms in three patients and one was significantly improved.	3.8934913364095913
The range of motion of the cervical spine was free of pain in all patients.	3.510441323661995
As a result, we strongly support immediate surgical treatment of an unstable os odontoideum in order to prevent severe and life-threatening neurological complications.	3.9231792423018876
Several studies from anglo-american countries indicate that in non-psychiatric hospital departments mentally ill patients have a longer length of hospital stay than mentally well, while in Austria and Germany, until now, no studies concerning this question exist.	3.7129037522073136
Based on the Clinical Interview Schedule, 28.1% of the patients in this sample suffered from psychiatric disorders.	3.1064441157862945
The presence of psychiatric disorders, as well as type of hospital department (medical department), higher age, more previous non-psychiatric treatment periods, and more somatic diagnoses predicted a longer duration of inpatient treatment.	3.578703014833037
To avoid the influence of cofounding variables, psychiatric cases were matched with psychiatric non-cases.	3.0761474377046416
The mentally ill group was treated for a markedly longer period as inpatients than the mentally well.	3.4433679958852763
Patients with a diagnosis of dementia or of substance abuse showed a significantly increased length of stay, while we could not confirm this for other psychiatric diagnoses.	3.4508847031538825
The development of new cardiopulmonary bypass technologies, special surgical instruments, as well as intrathoracic video systems facilitates mitral surgery via a small right thoracotomy.	3.253280316252455
Functional recovery after bilateral comminuted fractures of the humeral head with posterior dislocation is poor.	3.443171948511614
When reposition and internal fixation fail, the remaining alternatives are (hemi)arthroplasty and/or arthrodesis.	3.728854746471138
In a 50-year-old patient, we treated the dominant shoulder by arthrodesis; a Neer prosthesis was inserted at the other side.	3.193669070354037
Using this strategy, the advantages of both techniques were combined with an acceptable functional recovery, which ist especially important for young and active patients.	3.626506951333548
Commonly used regiments for gut decontamination after oral ingestion of toxic substances are induced emesis, gastric lavage and activated charcoal.	2.935860018615623
It was not until recently that the effectiveness of these procedures was studied systematically.	3.4632334471359463
The results of these studies are presented and the side effects and complications of the different procedures are discussed.	4.162742393702864
Together with the German poison control centers, guidelines for gut decontamination in pediatric patients were developed, based on the official recommendations of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT).	3.4749675370505217
The methodology used to assess postoperative continence has a significant effect on the outcome of incontinence surgery.	4.176480536327067
Retrospective chart review studies consistently report higher success rates than patient questionnaire-based outcome analyses.	3.0352145587939776
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the true long-term results of the Stamey bladder neck suspension procedure using an anonymous patient questionnaire.	3.13771103243823
Of 172 consecutive patients, 138 (80.2 %) returned a questionnaire on long-term continence, complications and subjective satisfaction with the operative result.	3.5083822336694044
With a mean follow-up of 66 months, 65 of 130 evaluable patients (50.0 %) remained completely continent while 15 (11.5 %) never became continent and 50 (38.5 %) had recurrent incontinence 6-90 months postoperatively.	2.8534858990570324
Almost two-thirds of the patients felt either cured or substantially improved more than 5 years after surgery.	3.8363003099317208
Stamey bladder neck suspension leads to a persistently improved quality of life despite a considerable failure rate.	4.030466225812276
Our study demonstrates the advantages of patient questionnaires for outcome analyses and emphasizes the need for standardisation and validation to allow comparisons between the results of different incontinence procedure in the future.	3.5326078850854907
Social work for the elderly in a demographical ageing society is not justified per se, but has to prove its utility under the altering social conditions of the changing age-structure.	3.4129709944511313
In the field of practice, this has led to an increasing need for professional orientation and to searching for profiles of performance with greater attraction.	3.220767597784192
Pseudoaneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) can be caused by external injury or may be due to spontaneous dissection.	4.022422834619514
Pseudoaneurysms bear an increased risk of arterio-arterial embolism.	3.6957416750481977
Treatment of pseudoaneurysms is influenced by the location and the type of injury, associated injurys, collaterals to the ipsilateral hemisphere, neurological signs and symptoms, growth of the lesion and patient age.	3.6309764771471675
Potential treatment regimen include conservative and medical approaches with anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, extra-intracranial bypass, resection of the pseudoaneurysm with vessel reconstruction, ligation or endovascular balloon occlusion of the ICA.	3.123099120822322
If there are contraindications for vessel occlusion conservative or medical treatment used to be the only therapeutic alternatives.	3.55411173177844
We report the treatment of two patients with extracranial ICA pseudoaneurysms after blunt injury with stent placement (in one case combined with coil embolization) as a further treatment option.	3.881966953565701
Introduction: The combination of direct magnification mammography and computed radiography provides an improvement in spatial resolution of storage phosphor-based digital systems.	3.2665333200844358
A clinical study comparing conventional and digital direct magnification mammograms was performed.	3.2065954867614366
Methods: 100 survey mammograms in 1.5- or 1.7-fold magnification and 50 4-fold spot magnification views were obtained with a prototype direct magnification mammography system and a storage phosphor-based digital system.	2.8416667658705648
An intraindividual comparison of these with previous conventional radiograms of the same patients was carried out.	3.5910690034677364
Results: The diagnostic value of digital survey mammograms using the direct magnification technique is comparable to that of conventional radiograms of the breast, especially with regard to the identification of microcalcifications and lesions and the clinical consequences.	3.8219811645970516
Spot magnification views performed with this combination of techniques allowed improvement in the evaluation of microcalcifications.	3.847188508270473
In 15 % of cases, diagnostic procedures were adjusted accordingly.	4.250447095552182
Conclusion: The combination of the direct magnification technique with digital storage phosphor radiography systems allows the performance of digital mammography by improving the overall spatial resolution.	3.258820997516702
The diagnostic value of digital direct magnification survey mammograms was comparable to that of conventional mammograms.	2.9599311822118852
Digital 4-fold spot magnification views improved visualisation of the morphologic aspects of microcalcifications.	2.8240466737166656
Warthin's tumour of the larynx is an unusual finding.	3.9876388051451412
In present literature only four cases have been reported.	3.208490708786161
Only one case of a woman suffering from Warthin's tumour of the protid gland and the ipsilateral site of the larynx has been published.	3.937377687289799
A case of a 74-year-old woman with an Warthin's tumour of the right parotid gland and the left false cord is presented.	3.6768345850017083
The theories about the development of Warthin's tumours are discussed.	3.8627068277301446
In rheumatic diseases, radiation synovectomy is a reliable method.	4.068813355532271
Meanwhile, radiation synovectomy is an outpatient therapy.	3.391730624360895
In addition, combination with arthroscopic synovectomy is an increasing therapeutic modality.	2.912512182825785
In comparison to the hitherto inpatient modality, a greater lymphatic emigration of the radionuclide and, therefore, a higher radiation exposure is possible.	3.3875284355058835
In 35 patients we found radionuclide emigration in 17 cases by whole body scintigraphy, resulting in a 50%-percentile with 68.27%-confidence interval of 1.8 (0.45-4.78)% of the injected yttrium-90-activity.	3.283244924289188
Comparison of 3 groups with the above mentioned therapy modalitites resulted in no statistical difference (p>0.05).	3.0647636172503585
Because of the found radionuclide emigration, a radiation dose of 0.1 (0.05-0,18) mSv in women and 0.2 (0.1-0.38) mSv in men was calculated.	3.278589665830253
For lymph nodes, liver, spleen and whole body radiation doses of 619 (154-1644) mSv, 62 (15-165) mSv, 62 (15-165) mSv and 37 (9-99) mSv were calculated.	2.554011328963025
Gonadal radiation dose can be neglected and the morbidity rate for tumors bacause of the whole body radiation dose is low with a value of 0.4 per thousand.	3.3503711956117304
Therefore, radiation synovectomy can be used unlimited by patients age and independent of the therapeutic modality.	4.0794667026005555
The goal of surgery using a thoracoscopic approach for the anterior reconstruction of fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine is the reduction of postoperative pain and morbidity.	3.8252284934766365
Fusion of the injured segment was performed by partial corporectomy and the vertebral body reconstructed using a tricortical autogenous bone graft.	3.6440998555733626
A plate and screw assembly was inserted to stabilize the surgical correction.	3.4686609923455163
This technique was used between May 1996 on May 1998 in 100 patients with 103 fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.	3.1569470765951584
Fractures from T4 to L3 were stabilized; most fractures occurred  at the thoracolumbar junction.	3.218510076629743
A monosegmental short fusion was given preference in 51 patients.	3.0293471191204295
A dorsoventral approach was necessary in 68 patients on account  of the fracture type.	4.0806094410069935
Comparing a group of 30 patients who had undergone an open procedure and a similar group treated under thoracoscopic assistance, we found a marked reduction of the postoperative need for analgesics and the duration of postoperative ventilation.	4.330704211745342
Pneumatic external counterpulsation operates by applying ECG-triggered diastolic pressure via cuffs to the vascular bed of the lower limbs.	3.1794937596025896
Comparable with intra-aortic balloon pumping, PECP produces a diastolic augmentation combined with increase of mean arterial pressure and coronary perfusion.	2.984194532248326
American, Asian, and our own data demonstrated a reduction of angina pectoris through repeated use of PECP one or two hours daily for four to seven weeks.	3.47710998143584
Exercise testing and thallium scanning confirmed the clinical improvement.	3.1904579079562922
Opening of collaterals and collateral growth induced by external counterpulsation are discussed as the cause of clinical benefit.	3.70718866444989
Transrectal fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the prostate under digital control is a cheap and rapid method for diagnostic evaluation of palpable and non-palpable nodules, yielding high sensitivity (ca.	3.5171665331349926
95%) and a low complication rate (<1%).	4.951191556169865
Its specificity amounts to >97%.	3.4335149359589803
The scarcity of urologists trained in the FNAB method and of pathologists experienced in cytology of the prostate limit the clinical application so far.	3.2397969865295253
Besides various forms of prostatitis, five different types of cancer can cytologically be differentiated.	3.5805375027583417
While PIN I cannot be cytologically identified, PIN II/III lesions may lead to false-positive diagnoses.	3.192905065885434
Cytologic grading of adenocarcinomas of the prostate is of statistically proven prognostic validity and strictly correlated with its histologic counterpart.	3.141301368831659
Preoperative, radiologically controlled FNAB of pelvic and paraortal lymph nodes has sensitivity of ca.	2.9426241639799118
86% and specificity of 100%.	3.7670548732612144
It thus helps to avoid unnecessary prostatectomies if nodal tumor spread has preoperatively been proven.	3.057471052910702
Diagnostic DNA cytometry is able to identify those prostatic cancer patients who do not reveal significantly increased risk of tumor progression or decreased survival probability, even without therapy (constantly and representatively diploid and tetraploid patterns).	3.3510444647833473
Patients with DNA tetraplid histograms may show detoriation of prognosis under hormonal therapy.	2.6771444506416873
DNA-aneuploid prostatic cancers should not be subjected to a "wait and see" strategy; they do not respond to hormonal therapy.	3.310546429238122
Early defibrillation is the standard of care for patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT).	3.9020547461805775
Technical developments aim at further miniaturization and simplification of defibrillators as well as adaptation of energy requirements to the patient's needs.	3.8318912240600373
Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD) and automated external defibrillators (AED) are based upon the same technology.	3.1971851749907296
Both devices analyze the ECG signal internally, followed by a "shock" or "no shock" decision.	3.6982532396012795
Use of automated devices is the prerequisite for defibrillation by non-physicians.	3.1432043749042164
Chest impedance measurements and use of alternative shock waveforms, such as biphasic, aim at adaptation of energy or current to the patient's individual needs and avoid application of unnecessarily high amounts of energy to the myocardium.	3.33216430220324
Calculation of median frequency is a non-invasive method for analyzing the heart's metabolic and electrical state.	3.4172868263032496
It helps to determine the optimal moment for defibrillation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).	3.0198757038305395
Developments concerning the structure of in-hospital emergency systems or pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS) aim at further reductions in time from collapse of a patient until first defibrillation.	3.6657199847587942
Such developments include early defibrillation programs for emergency medical technicians (EMT), nurses, and fire or police department first responders as well as wide distribution of easy-to-operate defibrillators in public areas, as discussed during the American Heart Association's Public Access Defibrillation conferences.	3.1289754648023766
All programs of that kind have to be organized and supervised by a physician who is responsible for training and supervision of the personnel involved.	3.56311317800954
Spontaneous breathing with Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) or Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) caused a reduction in intrapulmonary shunting and dead space ventilation and improvement in arterial oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.	3.3761180402012125
During spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP venous return, cardiac output and oxygen delivery increased while oxygen consumption remained unchanged.	3.0477744739433374
In patients early spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP was associated with a better arterial oxygenation than in patients receiving controlled mechanical ventilation for 3 days and were then weaned with APRV/BIPAP.	3.107599631823974
Length of mechanical ventilation, intubation and ICU stay was shorter in patients breathing spontaneously early with APRV/BIPAP.	3.260389334190241
Therefore, early spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP may be of advantage.	2.900532451521371
Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a rare but clinically distinct disorder which is easily overlooked.	3.335326664880317
It commonly occurs in older men and, because of its similarity to epileptic seizures, is often misdiagnosed.	3.798690699498865
The etiology of RBD is still unknown.	2.8486104696003496
However, there is an interesting association with Parkinson's disease which presents some pathophysiological hypotheses.	3.1634411521136983
Treatment is usually successful with clonazepam.	3.401469944123751
Various therapeutic options have been proposed in the treatment of femoral head necrosis ranging from conservative management to total hip arthroplasty.	3.9937039922047504
Since microsurgical techniques are routinely used in orthopaedic surgery, the importance of revascularization has increased in recent years.	3.5077847904138175
Vascularized bone grafting as well as various osteotomies have been considered for the stages II and III according to Ficat and II, III and IV of the criteria of the ARCO system respectively, which also bases on MRI-findings.	3.2902844287233823
We investigated the results of 80 patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head treated with a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft, perfused by the A. circumflexa ilium profunda, between 1988 and 1996.	3.27321499477366
Mean follow-up was 5,6 years.	3.816958229492069
The evaluation was based on the harris hip score, clinical and radiological examination as well as a subjective assessment using a VAS (visual analog scale).	3.7198084117559667
The clinical results according to the harris hip score were good or excellent in 86,1 %.	3.2814997904407788
These results correlate with the subjective assessment of pain and of the hip joint function with an average of 7,9 points using the VAS (max.	4.78083951460326
Unchanged radiological appearance over the follow-up period was observed in 47,5 % using the ARCO criterias.	3.875613206156539
Reviewing the studies using vascularized grafts, about 50 % of the patients with a stage II and III according to Ficat and II, III and IV of the ARCO respectively show an unchanged stage of the disease 5-6 years after the procedure.	3.95949219083486
Therefore, transplantation of a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft possibly offers the chance to intervene causally in the course of the disease with only little alteration of the biomechanics of the hip joint.	3.1246657670860865
This paper describes preprosthetic surgery from its historical beginnings to its present state-of-the-art status.	2.7164846910982505
Future perspectives of preprosthetic surgery are also outlined, excluding implants.	3.0900132269297735
In an enquiry of 250 German-speaking maxillofacial departments, 160 responded.	3.048897615204724
Results showed that a surprising 30-50% of the institutions are still following guidelines for procedures which have been proven by scientific follow-up studies to be almost 100% unsuccessful.	3.9747326421946347
This paper summarizes the results of an attempt to reconstruct the fates of Jewish pediatricians from Germany, Vienna and the German Pediatric Hospitals in Prague between 1933 and 1945.	3.391698766189845
The relevant archives in Europe, USA, Great Britain and Israel provided facts and relevant dates for 697 Jewish pediatricians who were humiliated and murdered or who emigrated.	2.600689745420925
Compared with the total number of 1361 pediatric specialists in the three areas, more than 50% of them were Jews as defined by the Nazi racial laws.	3.617177611485952
So far, 577 cases have been cleared up: 446 of them emigrated to 31 countries; 63 became victims of the Holocaust; other individual destinies included going underground or committing suicide.	2.560798237129171
The fate of about 120 persons is still unknown.	3.1322230435842053
We performed a prospective multi-center study in order to determine the causes of  30-day perioperative mortality.	3.933973880959224
The implantation of a mesh is an essential step in laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery.	3.5340629196431257
We present the case of a 22-year-old man who developed an unspecific and refractory syndrome of inguinal pain after a TAPP procedure for a primary inguinal hernia.	3.182184721179138
Repeated reoperation for removement of clips and nerve transection were unsuccessful.	2.9923277488710953
By a transinguinal approach, 18 months after the first operation we removed a preperitoneal Prolene mesh which had shrunk and folded to 30 % of its original size.	3.358893177955145
The problem of biocompatibility of meshes currently used in inguinal hernia surgery is discussed.	2.9124443742786412
Therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma remains difficult.	3.380887102481813
New therapeutic schemes besides cytokine treatment should be evaluated.	3.501160907083952
The following study analyzes the in vitro toxicity of treosulfan on spheroids of 8 primary cultures of renal cell carcinoma cells.	3.2361485686005493
These data were compared to the toxicity of vinblastine.	3.5876152354432524
All investigations were performed in regard to the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression of the cells, which is one of the main causes of multidrug resistance.	4.495285536798214
Four Pgp positive and four Pgp negative spheroids were incubated with the drugs in increasing doses.	3.15812025234517
Toxicity was measured using the MTT toxicity assay as well as trypan blue exclusion.	4.183667948798735
Significantly higher toxicity of treosulfan compared to vinblastine could be demonstrated.	3.065339032523456
In addition, the effects of treosulfan were not related to Pgp expression.	3.3518628188360595
These results are encouraging and a phase II study analyzing the efficacy of treosulfan in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma has been initiated in our institution.	3.8841303393075126
Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy renders beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids.	3.266225256000249
Additionally, direct protective mechanisms of estrogens in the blood vessels and myocardium are under study.	3.5599369602924726
Recent findings suggest an improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and coronary microcirculation.	3.558509728326837
Furthermore, it has also been suggested that this treatment has cardioprotective effects on the left ventricular geometry, i.e., nomial left ventricular mass and wall thickness.	4.0997138951353564
Whether the beneficial effects of estrogens are counterregulated by a combined use with progestins is not yet known and requires further investigation.	3.2133045264014926
Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide.	3.6433515222917072
Characteristic signs of malaria are special macroscopic and microscopic organ changes, which may also be seen in postmortem examinations.	3.917745792161804
Modern diagnostic tools allow a fast and reliable diagnosis.	3.455795576254458
The symptoms of malaria are rather unspecific, so the correct diagnosis may be difficult, especially if the doctor is not informed about the patient having been abroad.	3.478908237047222
The cases presented also point out possible legal consequences of a missed diagnosis.	3.0762023172371884
Prognostically relevant factors based on the histological assessment of the resected pancreas are known.	4.9465894813327
However, additional parameters, such as biological staging of the intrinsic malignant potentiality of the tumor, would be useful.	3.9964544883055386
There has been no uniform finding of a relationship between CD44 variant expression and tumor progression.	3.230378664708417
Method: We assessed the expression pattern and prognostic impact of CD44 standard and CD44 isoforms v4, v5, v6, v7 and v10 in 40 ductal pancreatic carcinomas by immunochemistry on paraffin-embedded tumor material in patients after tumor resection.	2.783051299316788
At the time of the investigation neither histomorphological parameters nor the survival time were known.	3.1263076796213776
Results: There was no correlation between the histomorphological parameter and the expression of CD44 splice variants.	3.5870206518823724
CD44 splice variants v4-v10 were almost only expressed in tumor tissue.	3.197369656036769
In ductal pancreatic carcinoma, patients with an overexpression of CD44 splice variants had a worse prognosis.	3.9235462088648183
However, because of the small number of cases this was statistically not significant.	3.5311813469780136
Conclusion: CD44 splice variants may have an influence on prognosis in ductal pancreatic carcinoma.	3.49081277008451
However, further investigation on a larger number of patients is necessary to confirm these results.	4.439928822469342
Regarding the etiology of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), congenital bone and/or fibromuscular anomalies, positional characteristics and trauma play a role.	3.519999491330686
Signs and symptoms are extremely variable, depending on whether the compression of the plexus, of the artery or of the vein is predominant.	4.380421829286544
In the clinical examination the AEST test is of utmost importance.	2.897437235154959
The visualization of the subclavian artery and vein by DAS in different positions is mandatory.	3.2178671460375288
Less than 5% of the patients show a subclavian artery aneurysm, but 76% have obstructions of digital arteries.	4.093852542810614
Every patient, must undergo a neurological examination including the measuring of the proximal ulnar and median nerve conduction times.	3.4138165202265287
Anatomical lesions of the subclavian artery, reduction of the proximal nerve conduction times and high-degree venous compression as well as disabling pain during the night with abuse of analgesics are absolute indications for the decompression of the neurovascular bundle.	4.59186529164877
This is achieved by the transaxillary exarticulation of the first rib together with a cervical rib and fibromuscular bands if present.	3.7095049197091527
The results of the primary operation are favourable: completely painfree 85%, markedly improved 12%, unchanged or worse 3%.	3.3550520858882518
The results of operations for persisting and recurrent TOS are disappointing: completely painfree 48%, markedly improved 31%, but 21% unchanged or worse.	2.807137111301381
Regional perfusion of the lung is not distributed homogeneously within the organ.	3.7740714051332414
based on the isolated canine lung.	4.656179888782808
The concept stresses the importance of different gravitational forces along the vertical axis of the lung resulting in three zones in which no pulmonary perfusion (zone 1), waterfall-like perfusion (zone 2), and continuous blood flow (zone 3) prevail.	4.0608993969178595
In this article, we review recent publications in which observations have been made which cannot be explained by the West model.	3.1171533566054936
A new concept of distribution of regional pulmonary perfusion is presented which centers on vascular factors which are better suited to account for observed blood flow heterogeneities.	3.1040284864241254
The pulmonary vasculature is composed of repetitions of one structural unit: the vessel bifurcation.	2.811685144002875
Apart from its size, each single bifurcation is similar to all others.	3.171481892091815
The pulmonary vessel tree can, therefore, be considered to be self-similar.	3.8028444769171643
Self-similarity has been identified as a design principle of living nature.	3.353829360731237
Self-similar objects can produce heterogeneity which is also self-similar when viewed at different scales of magnification.	3.037065655963528
For measurement of the structure of such objects and their function, i.e., in this case the heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion, fractal geometry is best suited.	3.7077816436706277
Distribution of blood flow within the lung can be described by means of fractal analysis, and all phenomena of perfusion distribution can easily be explained when applying this concept.	3.839174836769265
Furthermore, since the basis of fractal analysis is pulmonary vascular anatomy, it lends itself for the study of blood flow distribution.	4.059419597218007
A major advantage is the independence of fractal parameters from resolution of perfusion measurements.	3.0868656883115095
Thus, fractal analysis can be used to compare results that have been obtained using different resolutions and different species.	3.7387542445753708
Fractal methods have previously been used in medicine for other purposes.	3.7463404496923522
Nonlinear analyses of heart beat variability can predict the onset of malign cardiac dysrhythmias hours before actual appearance in the ECG.	3.369220088695926
Very similar methods applied to electrical brain activity have been shown to allow prediction of epileptical seizures approximately 15 min prior to appearance of clinical symptoms.	3.202693498795199
In part I of the paper the biomechanical and technical background of the EPTT using the MPT fixator and the indications for this procedure have been described.	3.5261010308408296
In part II we report about the clinical application of the EPTT in 67 patients with a wide spectrum of repairs and reconstructions of the extensor mechanism.	4.471864971606009
48 patients had fresh injuries, 18 of them with severe concomitant knee lesions and 19 patients had neglected rsp.	3.538886337783503
There were 4 deep infections, two of them related to the MPT fixator.	3.6870511915236506
In the patients with uneventful healing the fixator remained in place for 7.3 weeks in average.	3.35811709634607
There were 5 patients with partial patellectomy and tendon reattachment because of lower patella pole comminution and 12 patients with tendon reattachment ruptured at the inferior patella pole or suture repair in midsubstance rupture.	3.087834338507756
The clinical results according to the IKDC score were rated in 3 patients as normal, in 10 patients as nearly normal and in 4 patients as abnormal.	3.483473880908878
This rating was highly dependend on the subjective judgement by the patients who considered their operated knees not as normal as the contralateral knees.	3.6086608719301108
From our clinical experiences and results we can derive that the EPTT enables the surgical management of extensor mechanism disruptions with a minimum of internal fixation material and provides a safe protection of the repairs and reconstructions during the healing period.	3.4133459330441602
The EPTT allows immediate unrestricted functional rehabilitation and early walking without crutches.	3.033353438700107
Thus the EPTT represents an effective alternative to the patello-tibial cerclage with a wire or synthetic ligaments.	3.0470954503039693
Ondansetron is more effective than a placebo in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), but it has not been proved to be superior to established antiemetics for prophylaxis or therapy.	4.041617999476817
We compared ondansetron vs droperidol for the treatment of PONV.	3.762921421105686
Our prospective, randomized double-blind study was performed between 15 October 1992 and July 1993; it included 271 gynaecological ASA I - III inpatients who had been operated on under general anaesthesia with intubation.	3.437255237427281
Patients were excluded if: there was no informed consent; it was an ambulatory or emergency operation; the patient was pregnant or breast feeding; allergies were being treated with antihistamines; drug addiction was present or convulsions or Parkinson's disease; any pre- or intraoperative antiemetic medication had been administered.	3.2455975268449455
All patients wishing an antiemetic and/or suffering from at least one emetic episode during the first 24 h postoperatively received either 8 mg ondansetron or 1.25 mg droperidol from identical 4 ml ampoules intravenously.	3.23044952456441
The verbal nausea score (1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) was recorded every 30 min for 4 h, then before and 2 h after each antiemetic dose.	3.3513502897455294
All emetic episodes and the interval between administration and effect were also noted.	3.457364584306852
Patients were interviewed 36 - 48 h postoperatively on subjective effects, side-effects and individual acceptance.	3.471705704503269
After oral premedication with diazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopental, in a few cases with etomidate or propofol.	3.279815243639034
Relaxation was achieved with pancuronium or atracurium and, when indicated, with succinylcholine.	3.2901793389813845
Muscular relaxation was antagonized with neostigmin and glycopyrrolate.	3.107779667894622
Gastric content was aspirated once after intubation.	3.2214706016594277
Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen, enflurane, halothane or isoflurane and fentanyl up to 0.3 mg. Statistical evaluation was performed by the unpaired Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test.	3.138963710697195
Categoric variables were examined by the 2 test.	4.399024684693618
Significance was defined as P<0.05.	4.0890548840428735
Of 271 patients, 100 (37%) experienced PONV.	3.5263406485886217
The groups were statistically comparable with respect to demographic data, type and duration of operation, emesis record, perioperative uterotonic medication.	3.759398065121296
Twenty patients in the ondansetron group and 27 in the droperidol group received the first antiemetic within 2 h, the other patients up to 17 h after extubation.	3.5810934318504155
The reduction of these parameters after medication was similar.	3.2329395280213085
Complete response over 6 h was 60% in the ondansetron and 68% in the droperidol group.	3.8275845551406413
In both groups the first medication failed in 4 cases during the initial 2 h. Twenty of the ondansetron and 16 of the droperidol patients needed a second dose; among these 2 and 4, respectively, a third ampoule.	3.5063045206435146
No rescue medication was necessary over 24 h and a mean of 1.4 ampoules was administered in both groups.	3.4549962779696135
Onset and quality of emetic action were identical in both groups.	3.0756114816708315
It was not possible to evaluate 25 interviews due to linguistic or amnestic problems.	3.0225151726399204
Multiple side-effects were noted frequently.	4.312349364893886
Injection pain was reported significantly more often in the droperidol, pruritus in the ondansetron group.	3.874941850365653
Ninety-three percent of the ondansetron and 85% of the droperidol patients opted for the same drug for future PONV treatment.	3.3093227974455974
Ondansetron (8 mg) and droperidol (1.25 mg) proved to be equally effective when used as a postoperative antiemetic.	3.883923209385518
Both drugs showed similar side-effects.	3.3171054030053164
Due to differences in methods it was difficult to compare our results to those obtained in other studies.	3.4656343001095604
Paradoxical embolism is well-known in theory but rarely encountered in clinical practice.	3.6860551174332663
The typical pathophysiological background is the coincidence of venous thrombosis, elevated right atrial pressure, and a consecutive right-to-left shunting via a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.	3.661832916034368
This review summarizes the results of internal cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in comparison to external cardioversion.	4.290724735685712
Internal cardioversion was achieved by positioning defibrillation electrodes in the right atrium and coronary sinus (alternatively in the left pulmonary artery).	3.906454296666128
In previous studies also a combined internal/external cardioversion was used by locating a defibrillation electrode in the right atrium together with a cutaneous patch electrode.	3.2053020960815886
Although in comparative studies the success rate of 91-93% with internal cardioversion is higher compared to success rates of 67-79% with external cardioversion, the conventional method of external cardioversion remains the method of first choice.	3.4653459403787092
The success rate of internal cardioversion after failed external cardioversion ranges from 73 to over 90%.	2.9258444571836444
Possible indications for primary internal cardioversion are: induced atrial fibrillation during electrophysiological studies, atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery and cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in patients with permanent pacemaker implants.	3.4588916460435915
Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the importance of home care for patients with advanced tumor diseases and for their families.	4.920355317084588
VDD single-lead systems use floating ring electrodes for atrial sensing.	2.9233580724766717
To ensure an optimal atrial sensing function, knowledge of the interactions between electrode design, pacemaker, amplifier and implantation technique is required.	3.1515112081904704
In this overview, technical determinants of atrial sensing concerning atrial ring configuration (surface area, ring spacing, full/half ring), design of the lead (insulation material, conductor coil configuration), and amplifier design (differential amplifier, sensing impedance, bandpass filter) shall be explained and related to determinants at implant (AV distance, site of implantation, atrial position, intraoperative measurement technique).	2.992980792962832
(1) Ring configuration: Bipolar atrial full ring systems have proved to be efficient with narrow (5-10mm) or wide (15-30mm) ring spacing, as well as bipolar half ring systems with DAB configuration and narrow ring spacing.	3.4364122360470137
Especially in a position close to the atrial wall, a wide ring spacing detects a less clear-cut signal than a short ring spacing; on the other hand, with a wide ring spacing, sensing is less compromised if the rings move to a worse position further away from the wall.	3.2568158699784377
A narrow ring spacing detects a sharper signal if positioned close to the atrial wall, but a considerable reduction of sensed P wave amplitude may result if it moves away from the wall or to an oblique angle relative to the atrial depolarization front.	3.0250408305724203
(2) Design of the lead: Polyurethane as insulation material provides a higher stiffness than silicone insulation.	3.0622400257184417
A coaxial conductor configuration increases stiffness and consequently the possibility to manipulate the atrial part of the lead.	3.691587428922724
Thus, if a position close to the atrial wall is desired, the combination of a coaxial conductor coil, polyurethane insulation, and a narrow ring spacing seems most promising.	3.4660699512006174
(3) Amplifier design: For atrial sensing in VDD systems, bipolar sensing, differential amplifier, high sensing impedance (>=2k), and a wide bandpass filter (e.g., 10-100Hz) should be realized.	3.3617953951043544
Especially the inclusion of a relatively low frequency range (10-40Hz) is important, because compared to a fixed atrial electrode, a higher quantity of the atrial signal sensed by a floating electrode is in the low-frequency range.	3.9293810929016573
(4) Implantation: To choose the best fitting electrode, a preoperative assessment of the size of the right cardiac cavities should be performed.	4.080895912994772
Correct interpretation of the sensed P wave amplitude and prediction of sufficient sensing after connection with the pacemaker is only possible with exact knowledge of the measurement technique of the intraoperative pacing system analyzer and the connected permanent pacemaker device (bandpass filter, signal peak-to baseline or peak-to-peak).	3.3260285326168497
Attention should be paid to the fixation of the electrode at the site of insertion to avoid postoperative dislocation of the ring electrodes.	3.7831019524571823
Knowledge of different electrode/pacemaker specific parameters and special aspects at implantation is a prerequisite for optimal function of VDD single-lead systems.	2.9516734765366626
Preoperatively, considerations should concern the choice of the electrode (AV distance, ring spacing) and implantation strategy (position close to or rather apart from the atrial wall).	3.2797239428451066
An atrial position may only be accepted if sufficient sensing can be documented with a measuring method similar to that of the implanted pacemaker.	3.3668566340569432
Objectives: To investigate the agreement (and its potential dependency on extravascular lung water) between transpulmonary (TPID) and standard pulmonary artery (PAID) thermodilution cardiac output  measurements.	2.8511179287977937
In the industrial Western world, 8 % of the population suffer from urogenital discomfort.	3.229820203626603
Epidemiologic studies show that the incidence rises with age.	4.398678460529687
In light of the steadily increasing longevity in the female population, clinically manifested irregularities such as urogenital atrophy, recurrent urinary tract infections, irritable bladder, and incontinence pose a challenge to the attending physician.	2.714001863858097
To this day, urinary incontinence in later life is considered "normal" and "caused by old age."	3.3954552764731187
However, among other age-related reasons, the main cause of this disorder is postmenopausal hormone deficiency.	4.058614690599236
Thus, following thorough diagnostics, pathological changes in the urogenital tract can often be reduced or altogether eliminated by simple conservative measures such as topical hormone administration, which rapidly enhance patients' quality of life.	2.9523738829640402
The present study gives an overview of the physiology of urogenital aging and the diagnostic and therapeutic means available to physicians to alleviate patients' discomfort.	3.0196606658665144
Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is one of the most common pain syndromes in childhood, with prevalence rates ranging from 10 to 20% in all school-age children.	2.876646001368398
In nearly 50% the complaints persist over many years of their life-span to adolescence or adulthood.	2.380328196648745
Although the empirical findings have increased in the last decade, our knowledge about the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology is still very limited.	3.324559697787684
Current approaches suggest that we understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance (biopsychosocial paradigm).	2.564319863267869
In this respect there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial causes (daily hassles, specific life events), psychopathological factors (anxiety, depression, somatization disorder), and social environmental influences (mother's psychopathology, social modelling, reinforcement) in the pathogenesis of functional abdominal pain.	3.2486020978188264
The noticeable correlation with other pain syndromes and functional disturbances indicates that recurrent pain may possibly be a manifestation of a basic somatization disorder.	3.4274777418127296
The unfavourable long-term prognosis supports the need for early and specific interventions.	3.407799906488586
Psychological treatment requires a medical examination to exclude organic origins.	3.426344053048584
Some of these invasive diagnostic procedures can be very difficult, expensive and distressing for the child.	3.2009159822608595
Behavioural medicine is based upon having an extensive family history and symptom analysis.	3.410426374071413
The psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis, reduction of pain symptoms and environmental modification.	2.805714176340304
In recent years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioural treatment programs for children.	2.1215439065420525
Although preliminary data on the use of these behavioural medicine programs have shown some promise, further investigations are needed to examine the applicability and effectiveness of specific interventions in the treatment of abdominal pain symptoms.	4.3697107704067895
Dermatologic disorders of the stump in patients with a leg amputation may have characteristic pathophysiologic and clinical features.	4.586285416042476
A knowledge of these factors may lead to earlier diagnosis and avoid immobilization.	3.995820859480712
There ist no German language review of this aspect of dermatology.	3.3000296817037342
After providing an overview of the problem, including a discussion of prostheses, we review the following problems: mechanically induced blisters, follicular keratoses, epidermoid cysts, stump edema syndrome, acroangiodermatitis (pseudo-kaposi sarcoma) and verrucous hyperplasia.	3.2400586618876535
Secondary aortoenteric fistulas are a well-known complication after open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.	3.4092783495929764
This is the first case description of an aortoenteric fistula after endoluminal treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.	3.2029668089856473
Preoperative diagnosis by antigranulocyte immunscintigraphy established infection of the protheses.	3.298280799108915
The problem was solved by closing the defect of duodenum, removing the endoprotheses and in situ reconstruction with omentumplasty.	2.8711910322970007
The reasons and consequences are discussed.	3.173379432127241
Concepts in the treatment of craniomaxillofacial fractures have changed over the last 15 years.	4.038315145448579
Modern imaging techniques have become a central part in establishing a proper diagnosis.	3.3637569325733656
Advanced life support and intensive care medicine allow for early primary fracture treatment.	3.6897794552834577
The former principles of minimal exposure of bone fragments using small incisions have been replaced by principles from reconstructive craniofacial surgery comprising extensive subperiosteal dissection, exposure of all fracture lines, open reduction and rigid internal fixation.	2.9473905216836314
Missing bony structures are replaced primarily by autogenous bone grafts.	3.2996751081135307
Using these concepts, most late esthetic and functional sequelae of facial fractures can be diminished remarkably.	3.1869218041749567
In a 20-year period (1974-1993), 4230 patients underwent surgery of the gallbladder.	3.7005902109992483
Acute cholecystitis was the indication for emergency laparotomy in 869 patients (20,5 %).	3.5355779966908765
Retrospective analysis demonstrated that after adjustment for age, sex, and mode of surgery - elective versus emergency - advanced age is not a risk factor contributing to mortality in uncomplicated cases of emergency surgery.	3.26468657537057
Cases of acute cholecystitis complicated by perforation, peritonitis, and/or the presence of concrements in the biliary duct are associated with an increased mortality, however.	3.957591317521715
We were able to demonstrate that advanced age is a risk factor in complicated cases and contributes to increased post-surgical mortality.	3.08324914647178
The clinical effect of ionidizing radiation on ocular neovascularizations is controversial not only because of the variety of treatment modalities.	3.370181938557704
The aim of our study was to investigate an experimental model which allows to evaluate radiation parameters and to study the mechanism of the inhibitory effect on neoangiogenesis.	3.170307213241505
We report on a 59-year-old woman patient with selective IgA deficiency and familial hypercholesterinaemia.	2.796610717610867
To lower elevated LDL levels in the patient's blood, immunoadsorption therapy with sheep-anti-human polyclonal antibodies coupled to sepharose columns was administered.	2.993027049737834
During the procedure, the patient developed an anaphylactic shock requiring intensive care treatment.	3.836050572014116
The patient's history revealed a fresh cell therapy with fetal sheep cells 10 years previously.	2.923523376460384
Intracutaneous testing confirmed sensitization to sheep immunoglobulin, which was the most likely reason for the anaphylactic shock.	4.475607091201983
A nationwide survey was performed to evaluate the significance of knee replacement (endoprosthesis) in Germany.	3.9616774438878744
All orthopaedic, traumatologic and general surgeons were asked about their preferred surgical techniques, favourite types of prosthesis and related issues.	2.995673064020563
Sledge prostheses have been increasingly preferred to constrained prostheses in the last few years.	3.243097127997565
Unicompartmental prostheses as well as constrained prostheses and high tibial osteotomies are still chosen for special cases.	3.9073543184499573
Revisions were most commonly due to patella problems.	3.3933374867083006
Patella replacement is popular to prevent this problem.	3.5684880521819733
An important problem is the increasing costs of the method.	3.483928760240641
Chronic pulmonary hypertension and septic lung failure display different clinical features resulting in severe disturbances in the pulmonary circulation.	3.428429764332986
In these diseases, the pulmonary bloodflow is impaired by a pathologic constriction of blood vessels that may lead to right ventricular overloading as well as serious worsening of gas exchange mainly caused by ventilation/perfusion mismatch.	3.756089804668549
Various mechanisms deteriorating the vascular function may induce both an irreversible and a reversible contraction of pulmonary vessels, respectively.	2.94420241241022
Two pharmacological approaches exist to reduce the vascular resistance:...	3.96047495718885
Objective: to examine mortality, mobility, pain, institutionalization rates six month after hip fractures.	3.3459574505165817
Lateral acetabular osteotomy in comparison to three-dimensional osteotomies of the pelvis in hip dysplasia is a simple technical procedure.	4.388730545580028
Contraindications are an age over 8 years and an irreducible femoral head.	3.211007399149024
For a long time we have used xenogenic deproteinized bone wedges from animals.	3.0744731629780326
We now use autoclaved and deep-frozen wedges from allogenic femoral heads.	3.0146478945444395
Our results in 109 patients show that this method is very successful; even extreme angles of acetabular index correction are possible with this technique.	3.2148942566876384
It is unfortunate that the lateral acetabuloplasty with autoclaved allogenic bone graft is not used frequently and we recommend that this method be installed at all paediatric orthopaedic hospitals.	2.9959113493555622
There are only few publications about the effect of music therapy on pain relief.	3.3839980916832197
The intention of this prospective study is to demonstrate the influence of the Nordoff/Robbins method of active music therapy in a group of 12 patients with fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndromes and polyarthritis on pain reduction, life quality and coping.	4.200567835225766
The clinical parameters of each patient were related to the observations in the audio- and video-documented music therapy settings and to the self-reported changes in pain intensity and pain behaviour.	3.5989541505089533
There was a significant reduction of pain intensity and pain-related disability in the music group compared to a control group, but no change in the depression and anxiety score.	3.905264047211897
The influence of music therapy could be even better demonstrated in the systematic analysis of the single cases by individual profiles.	3.6751987752807924
Active music therapy affects especially the communicative and emotional dimension of chronic pain.	3.2056270130638254
Psychophysiological and psychodynamic models are presented to explain the effectiveness of music therapy on pain reduction.	4.068535798776339
Clinical studies on music therapy as well as on other "art therapies" should relate the analysis of clinical parameters to the descriptive-phenomenological documentation of the therapeutic process to demonstrate systematically the influence of music and art in the individual case.	3.8093161795605472
Background: Retrospective analysis to  assess the value of the sequential arginine-insulin-test (SAIT) in the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD).	3.7368553220346827
Case Report: The case of a 57-year-old woman is reported who was admitted for peripheral hypereosinophilia.	3.292817024137654
Auditory similarities in voices of monozygotic twins have already been described in the literature.	3.1252986253850303
However, is there a clinical relevance?	3.987872264405652
Thus, the present study was designed to identify parameters of vocal performance and acoustic features which are significantly more similar in monozygotic twins than in non-related persons.	3.1777097242440187
In our hypothesis, comparable prerequisites for an increased vocal load in a profession or in an artistic education of the voice could be due to these similarities.	3.2198356281282305
We compared intra-pair differences with data from a control group.	3.039168370608012
Moreover, we examined the correlation of intra-pair differences with the age of the monozygotic twins.	3.6305182191254666
A greater difference in older twin pairs than in younger pairs could show the effect of an exogene influence.	3.3606278731626276
In addition to the few phoniatric studies in twins in the literature, we used current methods for acoustic analysis.	3.6150940923956196
We found significant differences in seven of ten parameters (vocal range, highest and lowest vocal fundamental frequency, fundamental speaking frequency, maximum voice intensity, number of partials, vibrato of intensity; U-test by Mann-Whitney).	2.9809122142671676
No correlation of the differences of the identical twins with age was found in the examined parameters.	4.284414427491796
The voices of identical twins are significantly more similar than those of non-related persons regarding the above mentioned features.	3.541452594363869
Thus, the suitability of the voices of monozygotic twins for professions with a high demand on voice is comparable.	3.087145445428641
Results of the group comparison correlate largely with the literature.	3.3613357017734242
The missing correlation with age could be due to the fact that the environmental effects were not measurable, and/or the development of the voice is more influenced by genetic effects.	3.985138586335782
After > 10 000 treatments - our HM3/4 and MPL 9000 have been replaced by the Siemens Lithostar multiline.	2.8022441477792066
As a ESWL center with ESWL as the primary treatment indication for all types of stones in kidney and ureter we report our initial experience with this new multifunctional lithotripter.	3.0865137812831303
Stone localization is achieved in a - 10 ° and + 30  ° position without movement of the patient.	3.715802254533293
The treatment table itself allows most endourologic and percutaneous auxiliary procedures.	2.7827500940267442
Additionally, an intergrated inline ultrasound is available.	3.020660187202922
From 10/94 to 08/95, 204 male and 96 female patients with a mean age of 50.7 (4-92) years underwent ESWL with the Lithostar multiline.	3.540302622247456
The mean stone diameter was 10.3 (2-20) mm with 53 % ureteral and 47 % renal stones.	3.051922451286752
300 patients underwent 480 treatments (average shocks 3673, range 793-8000; mean energy level 5.5, range 1-9).	3.2111027764952778
Stone localization was achieved after 5 (1-39) min (mean fluoroscopy time 3.1 (0.5-16.2) min).	3.6146907431992523
In 92.7 % no analgesic premedication was done.	3.252948907425429
56 % of the patients needed no analgesics at all during ESWL.	4.555803376431434
44 % received 8.1 (2-15) mg Piritramid intravenously.	3.6139593010777102
Epidural anesthesia was performed in only 2.3 % for a second treatment.	3.9990504686121593
95 % of the patients had complete stone disintegration.	4.8205484399506
In 68 % disintegration was achieved in one session.	3.8423372079912514
ESWL was repeated for further disintegration in 18.5 %, because of an unsuccessful treatment in 11.5 % and because of technical interruption of the previous session in 2.5 %.	3.5086127295807397
We saw subkapsular haematomas in 2 %.	3.1766131020776815
Auxiliary procedures following ESWL were necessary in only 9.2 % of the patients.	3.1874434885281455
In situ ESWL with the new Lithostar Multiline seems to be as effective as the Dornier HM3/4.	3.4921357850915364
Auxiliary procedures were less frequently necessary as compared to our previous experience with in situ ESWL.	3.9394417872449137
We report on a strikingly frequent referral of former preterm babies with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and subsequent ARDS in our hospital during the winter 1994/95 with regard to the clinical course under application of alternative treatment modalities.	3.032140522157223
Treatment modalities like inhalational ribavirin, use of bronchodilators and instillation of surfactant had been tried without success.	2.941903252733158
All children (age: 1-43 months) were ventilated for 6.6 (1-17) days with FiO2 = 1.0 and a mean airway pressure of 16.4 (10-24) cm H2O.	3.6043065810880326
Mean arterial blood gases were 49 (paO2) and 41 (pCO2) mm Hg, the OI was 33.4.	3.111850397201708
By inhalational NO in combination with IPPV or HFOV 4 patients could be stabilized, in the other 6 ECMO became necessary.	4.3058764948709625
Two of them died in spite of several weeks on ECMO; 8 children survived and could be discharged home after a mean hospital stay of 3 months.	3.545530067206627
Even in very severe cases of RSV infection treatment modalities like NO, HFOV and ECMO can be used successfully.	3.3122385146558835
The use of these treatment modalities must be considered before the lung damage is irreversible; in those cases a pre-existing BPD is no contraindication even for extracorporeal lung support.	3.4351007760303887
The vascular organization of human spermatic cord was analyzed by means of injection and by casting preparation of the testicular artery and veins of the pampiniform plexus after orchiectomy.	3.436835350468657
After leaving the human testis, the testicular veins are organized in two main groups and form two vein plexus.	3.0791349352403934
One of these vein groups forms a tight plexus around the testicular artery.	2.5731356648762085
Computer-aided 3-D reconstructions based on the paraffin serial sections of the human spermatic cord allowed us to demonstrate the relation between the blood vessels and the other tissue structures of the spermatic cord.	4.048315254924397
The results obtained allowed us to subdivide the human spermatic cord into three compartments.	2.9067151531722573
The dorsomedial compartment contains the vas deferens and its blood vessels.	3.0270588466626256
The middle compartment contains the testicular artery and the vein group which forms a tight plexus around this artery.	3.1528758532916603
The ventrolateral compartment contains a vein group which shows no topographic relation to the testicular artery.	3.355912332828885
This vein group is embedded in a large, macroscopically visible volume of fatty tissue.	3.1683228761943147
To be sure of sparing the testicular artery during antegrade sclerotherapy this vein group should be prepared.	3.1493102324336593
It has known for a long time that Sydenham's chorea and tics, as seen in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS), are phenomenologically very similar.	3.0174716180829195
Tics may occur as symptoms of acute Sydenham's chorea or persist over years as residual symptoms.	3.1998515470282873
Investigations of children suffering from GTS, including obsessive-compusilve symptoms, have provided signs of a poststreptococcal autoimmune process but also shown that treatment based on immunological interventions has been effective.	3.037304364729025
We treated a 14-year-old boy showing all diagnostic criteria of GTS, familial susceptibility, and an increase in the antibody titer of streptococcal antigens with 7S immunoglobulins i.v.	3.2343009024178357
Response to this therapy was good regarding motor tics, vocal tics, and behavioral symptoms such as disturbed impulse control which still persisted after 9 months.	2.9987129531588934
These findings and the successful therapy underline reports of the literature and point to a pathogenetic mechanism of an immunologically triggered disturbance of the striatal dopaminergic system, at least in a subgroup of GTS.	3.664448515409396
We report on three cases with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes.	2.709899822726241
All three patients suffered from autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II.	3.245033523305311
Among our patients with isolated IDDM (about 250 patients) no case of ITP was seen.	3.415870840908897
The high rate of coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality needs preventive intervention.	3.1330580445403013
Several studies have documented the effectiveness of LDL-cholesterol lowering in CAD primary prevention.	3.3775606717405964
The West of Scotland Prevention Study resulted in risk reduction by about one third through LDL-cholesterol lowering.	2.995618280310473
The data indicate that specifically patients at high risk benefit from lipid reduction.	3.172805126083553
High risk patients have besides high LDL-cholesterol one or more additional risk factors such as family history of premature coronary artery disease, hypertension, smoking, low HDL-cholesterol or diabetes.	3.380136189825498
Therapy primarily aims at life style changes, secession of smoking and weight reduction as well as dietary changes to achieve LDL-cholesterol levels of 115-175 mg/dl (3-4.5 mmol/L), depending on the individual risk constellation.	3.6059092928227674
This strategy allows to reduce the number of patients needed to treat in order to prevent one CAD event (56 in isolated hypercholesterolemia) to 14-24 in high risk persons, approaching the number (n=13) known for effective lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.	3.308828954264625
One hundred and three cases of Spitz nevi were reviewed.	3.6469805991092277
36% of these patients were adults.	4.697907210909907
The lesions in children occurred primarily on the face and secondarily on the trunk followed by the extremities.	3.837639794525928
In adults, they affect the legs in women, and the trunk in men as does malignant melanoma.	3.8392988846941094
Clinically they were diagnosed more frequently as Spitz nevi in children and adolescents than in adults.	3.434046344822708
Spitz nevi were most commonly mistaken clinically for "common" melanocytic nevus, hemangioma, verruca, fibrous histiocytoma, molluscum contagiosum, granuloma pyogenicum, keloid, and melanoma.	2.799818351161219
Histologically, there are various expressions of Spitz nevi, but they are usually compound melanocytic nevi with little pigmentation and typically large spindle- and/or epithelioid melanocytes.	3.7220578597855707
There are only small histopathological differences between Spitz nevi in childhood and adulthood: one important feature rarely seen in Spitz nevi of adults is multiple mitotic figures at the dermo-epidermal junction but rarely at the base of the melanocytic nevus.	2.7568279309426766
Nevus Reed is considered to possibly be a distinctly pigmented variant of Spitz nevus.	3.442814416996157
A few months ago an endovascular implantable PTFE stent graft became commercially available.	2.8348408377174086
Since May 1998 we have treated 15 patients with extensive vascular occlusion at the femoropopliteal level.	3.6649755341166954
The implantation is carried out via a single inguinal approach in combination with conventional vascular surgical techniques like orthograde ringstripping of the superficial femoral artery, local TEA and patch-grafting of the femoral bifurcation, angioplasty, local lysis, etc.	3.351926103834218
The self-expanding thin-walled PTFE stent prothesis appears to be a viable alternative to the femoropopliteal P1 bypass and can be performed under local anesthesia, percutaneously or through a small inguinal incision.	3.5791391595622133
The implantation can be carried out with minimal tissue trauma.	3.8640511717175148
Radiological and orthopaedic outcome in severe and moderate haemophilia A and B patients undergoing long-term prophylactic treatment were prospectively investigated focusing on the age of onset of prophylaxis and the number of joint bleedings prior to treatment.	3.797269953482676
We report on 21 patients with severe and moderate haemophilia A and B receiving prophylactic treatment of between 3.1 and 16.1 years duration.	3.0431486048835046
Three patient groups were evaluated according to the age at onset of prophylaxis.	4.415716655196493
In group I (n = 8) prophylactic treatment was initiated in the first 2 years of life.	3.634028690941474
Patients of group II (n = 6) received prophylaxis at the age of 3-6 years.	3.918476635644178
Late-onset or secondary prophylactic treatment was started at the age of 6 years and above in 7 patients (group III).	3.867486291019915
All patients received virus-inactivated F VIII or F IX concentrates at dosages of 30-40 IU, in some cases up to 50 IU/kg body weight i. v. three times per week for those with haemophilia A and twice per week for those with haemophilia B. Elbow, knee and ankle joints were investigated at 3-4 yearly intervals according to the radiological and orthopaedic scores recommended by the World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH).	3.0852327264394126
The total number of joint bleedings before and after start of prophylaxis were recorded in all patients.	3.51384802341234
In group I 7 out of 8 patients had unaffected joints with constant radiological and orthopaedic scores of zero or 1, after a median of 11.25 years of prophylactic treatment.	3.0152511617772375
One patient in this group demonstrated mild radiological alterations (score 4).	3.396879732003861
Patients of group II showed neither radiological nor orthopaedic alterations at study entry.	2.6198809422152056
Treatment group III already showed considerable joint damage at study entry with a median radiological score of 11 (0-33) and a median orthopaedic score of 4 (0-11).	3.8845802058453187
Despite prophylactic treatment both, orthopaedic (median 8, range 2-12) and radiological scores (median 19.5, range 2-47) deteriorated after 3 years.	3.1340074426913733
Prior to onset of prophylaxis no or only one joint bleeding occurred in treatment group I.	3.209421121296752
In group II, a median of 6 joint bleeds (range 1-8) were reported before prophylaxis was started.	3.826503348081724
Patients of group III usually experienced a median of more than 10 joint haemorrhages (range 6-10 or more).	3.8659181760262546
Under prophylactic treatment the number of joint bleedings decreased significantly in groups II and III.	3.9935409043474763
However, radiological and orthopaedic scores increased as a sign of progressing osteoarthropathic alterations in patients reporting more than 6 joint haemorrhages before onset of prophylaxis whereas no joint alterations could be assessed in patients with no or only one joint bleeding episode prior to prophylaxis.	3.473140905483725
Even a small number of joint bleedings seems to cause irreversible osteoarthropathic alterations leading to haemophilic arthropathy.	3.128671566876193
Once apparent, further progression of joint damage could not be arrested despite of prophylactic treatment (group II and III).	3.762468259733118
In order to prevent haemophilic arthropathy, effective prophylaxis should be started before or at least after the first joint bleeding in severe haemophilia A and B.	3.5751077797598714
The hemodynamic treatment of septic shock consists of fluid repletion, maintenance of an adequate cardiac output, and restoration of mean arterial pressure.	3.3283445259490927
Norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor that can be considered when the patient is adequately fluid resuscitated, when cardiac output is greater than 3.5 l/min/m2 (or Sv O2>=65%) and when blood pressure remains low.	3.9687319219639052
The objective is to achieve and maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60-70 mmHg, or more in some patients (older or hypertensive patients).	3.47128849464015
Renal effects of norepinephrine were evaluated in several studies; urine output, creatinine clearance, and osmolar clearance are significantly increased.	3.3041257729660485
Norepinephrine is perfectly suited in situations of high renal output and low renal resistance, as is the case in septic shock patients.	3.2004465562229165
The effect on oxygen transport is unpredictable.	2.887342830044958
The effects on lactate concentrations were poorly evaluated, but several studies suggest that the drug does not worsen and can even improve tissue oxygenation of septic shock patients.	3.239694047695409
Provided that cardiac output is maintained, treatment with norepinephrine is without negative effects on splanchnic tissue oxygenation.	3.4603580428195206
In conclusion, the clinical experience with norepinephrine strongly suggests that this drug can successfully increase blood pressure without deteriorating cardiac output and organ function.	3.150703306325558
Whether using norepinephrine in septic shock patients effects mortality as compared to dopamine or epinephrine still requires a prospective study.	3.3941940111034152
Is it possible to find a correlation between the localisation of neovascularisations and the localisation and extension of the retinal ischemia?	4.490100100884904
Ischemia was recognized not as capillary non-perfusion but as impaired retinal perfusion.	3.1253328588541733
Elderly patients with known episodes of atrial arrhythmia and indication to pacemaker therapy are borderline cases relative to selection of ventricular single-chamber or dual-chamber pacemaker.	3.155175519631986
The frequency of recurrence of arrhythmic episodes under dual-chamber pacemaker therapy is there the most important criterion.	3.58850852078445
The differences between patients prone to paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter) and patients without atrial tachyarrhythmia in their medical history were investigated.	3.118750044407983
Frequency of recurrence of atrial fibrillation/flutter and the rate of successful therapy after implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker were studied.	3.9843915667991086
The long-term history of 39 patients with known intermittent or durably successfully treated episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter was compared with 24 patients with new atrial tachyarrhythmia after pacemaker implantation.	3.438960810024095
There was no significant difference in the frequency of recurrence and in therapy efficiency of atrial tachyarrhythmia between both groups.	3.6067305888288934
The results show the benefit of implanting a dual chamber pacemaker also for patients with a known history of atrial tachyarrhythmia.	3.8343025340194385
It therefore, should be postulated for therapy of those patients.	4.050387846499942
Although the risks and side effects of blood transfusions have been significantly reduced during the past years, the potential infectious and immunologic side effects still require a clear and restricted indication before each transfusion is performed.	3.698394487204072
However, the transfusion errors before and during administration of blood components nowadays represent the highest risk in particular for critical care and high risk patients.	3.283119949419767
This article focuses on the specific problems of handling, preparation, and practical performance of transfusions.	3.1813283743589906
Some practical aspects and problems of transfusions are examplary shown for intensive care and high risk patients, such as immunosuppressed, transplanted or polytraumatic patients and critical care premature neonates.	3.4479646902200627
Vincent's angina (Plaut-Vincent) is the most prominent disease caused by coinciding infections from fusibacteria and spirochaeta both belonging to obligate anaerobic bacterias.	3.0474385572799387
A possible symbiotic infection of both anaerobics may become manifest on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and the oropharynx beside the tonsillas.	2.7988428719146463
The clinical outcome may be different and pose difficulties in the differential diagnosis.	3.136252750012172
We report the case of a 29 year old female patient with necrotizing ulcera of the soft palate suspicious for stomatitis ulceromembranacea.	2.807893653001896
In case necrotizing inflammations of the oral cavity area were to be found infections due to anaerobic bacterias should be considered mostly occuring as mixed infections.	3.362222060980475
The correct identification by cultivation turnes out to be difficult in that it requires special conditions.	3.3754333963301417
Furthermore, reliable detection of these bacterias necessitates careful collection and transport of patients specimens.	2.989119259612341
In case of Fusospirochaetosis (Fusotreponematose) a specimen should be prepared for microscopic examination beside setting up a special culture.	2.7713305338106564
This is because the staining is the most suitable procedure for bacteril identification to support the clinical diagnosis of stomatitis ulceromembranacea.	3.544137602400606
Quantitative tissue Doppler echocardiography is a new diagnostic approach to left ventricular systolic performance.	4.132357173951221
The aim of the present study was to validate a recently developed method based on the computer software TDI-Labor enabling a variable time and space related measurement of regional wall velocity from tissue Doppler images.	2.776607020420917
Therefore, in 63 volunteers the mean velocity of a 2 mm thick subendocardial slice during the systolic ejection period was determined from frozen Doppler M-mode images of the left ventricular posterior wall obtained using the left parasternal window.	3.2099809456438257
The same images were employed for comparative measurement of the mean endocardial velocity using the conventional M-mode slope approach.	3.366744412339429
Tissue Doppler data of the subendocardial wall velocity were found to correspond closely to the mean endocardial wall velocity (y = 0.97x + 0.17; r = 0.77; p < 0.0001).	3.116302827848107
The average wall motion gradient of the population was 1.33  +/-  0.35.	3.3666396252016
Wall motion velocity and wall motion gradient were shown to be not age dependent.	3.3557007786097994
Historically, the profession of geriatric nurse has arisen from the care of the sick and has developed very differently from region to region.	3.0652383181573986
A question as to the status of development of the profession of geriatric nurse cannot be answered by reference to the current status of legislation on professional law matters.	3.8069291612009293
If experts in that field focus too long on such matters, there is a danger that decisive developments in the profession of geriatric nurse take place outside their field of vision.	3.1125262310009916
It is reported about the recent detection of not yet compensated victims of forced sterilisation during the Third Reich.	2.964051179174027
The author describes the current state of compensation practice.	3.2192376020545526
From a global viewpoint, tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases of our time.	3.2354488107385215
The situation in Germany, as in most comparable industrialized nations, is stable.	3.6545741692550164
The declining trend of previous years continued in 1997, when 11,163 people developed active tuberculosis - an incidence of 13.6/100,000.	3.0941413028431506
However, the tuberculosis  problem cannot be restricted to one country, and Germany is particularly affected by trends in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet countries.	3.2635959407476
These countries experienced a marked increase of tuberculosis  cases and resistant strains during recent  years, a tendency which can only be countered by fast, well-aimed and efficient action in the affected areas.	3.642883342934317
The industrialized nations in particular should consider financial and logistic contributions as their duty.	3.057775409402313
We report about a 61 years old patient, who suffered a rare ulnar dislocation of the ellbow after being arrested by the police.	3.5780561795871266
We report on the eighth known case of a mature metastasis of a mature teratoma of the testis.	3.1158928891821467
In a 19-year-old patient who had undergone a pyeloplasty of the left renal pelvis 6 years before, a mature metastasis of an occult mature teratoma of the testis was found at the former operation site.	3.4180332068259682
This case - in addition to those published previously - emphasizes the fact that a mature teratoma of the testis has to be regarded as a malignant tumor in adults.	3.77650842497759
It is supposed that the mature teratoma originates, as other testicular tumors, from carcinoma-in-situ-cells, which are responsible for metastasize and are not detected after lysis.	3.824138653098008
Angiofibromas are usually characterized by their occurences in adolescent males with a typical localization and involvement of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx.	3.445795503169393
Even the suspicion of an extranasopharyngeal angiofibroma or an angiofibroma in young children must be viewed in general with skepticism, although reports of angiofibromas with atypical localizations and manifestations in young children have appeared in the literature.	2.9603374998992775
Three cases of this fibro-vascular neoplasm with manifestations in the first decade of life and atypical localizations are presented: (1) an angiofibroma medial to the left lacrimal sac in a 15-month old boy, (2) a right paranasal localization in a 9-year-old boy and (3) an angiofibroma limited to the right sphenoid sinus in a 6-year old boy.	4.09234821560766
In all three cases the neoplasm was resected via an endonasal, micro-endoscopic approach that avoided an external incision.	3.0768837850730533
According to the literature and based on our own experiences with typical histological findings in all three cases, the clinician has to be aware that the rare angiofibroma can occur in pre-adolescent children with atypical localizations.	3.918255366088737
The endonasal surgical approach is without any doubt the least traumatic one and in selected cases allows resection of a circumscribed tumor considering functional and aesthetic aspects.	3.3812576234705527
Objective: Chronic recurrent abdominal pain in childhood is frequently due to a Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis.	3.9156023159569004
The diagnosis should be verified either by gastric biopsy culture or by histological investigations of the gastric mucosa in children.	3.198535534109708
The gastroscopy necessary for this often requires general anesthesia.	3.255394137684476
The purpose of the present study was to etablish whether an ELISA for Helicobacter pylori has an adequate predictive reliability with regard to the putative gastric histology in order to possibly prevent unnecessary biopsies and associated anesthesias.	3.247327192830284
Complete dislocated fractures of the thoracic spine may have no neurological deficits if separation is present in the middle of the dorsal column.	3.9492962927922832
In this case there is no injury to the spinal cord, because the "saving fracture" of the vertebral arc prevents it.	4.409233222749402
One case of a severe dislocated fracture at T11-12 is reported.	3.3272931435359197
In practice, a complete set of X-rays should be done after high-speed trauma, even if no neurological deficit is present.	3.8843805689966913
The treatment is operative by open reduction and fusion from the ventral or dorsal column.	2.9151431902765697
Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring transmitter in the mammalian brain, related to sleep regulation and possibly to energy balance in diving or hibernating animals.	3.0318187591574866
It has been used for almost 35 years as an intravenous agent for induction of anaesthesia and for long-term sedation.	3.903828337823875
Its convincing pharmacological properties, without serious adresse effects on circulation or respiration, are compromised by its unpredictable duration of action.	3.0714889062701842
This is not a major problem with long-term sedation during ICU treatment.	4.258432053009246
GHB has been used with good results for sedation of patients with severe brain injury, where it compares favourably with barbiturates.	3.9343776089498506
In animal studies, it seems to possess a protective action against hypoxia on a cellular and whole organ level.	2.964357873197952
However, in some experimental animals GHB has been shown to produce seizure-like activities, and the compound is being used to produce absence-like seizures.	3.760478834038167
GHB has been used in our ICU for years to provide adequate sedation for patients under controlled ventilation or for patients figthing the respirator during spontaneous respiration.	3.138429238514567
No serious side effects were observed in these patients, while in some patients under haemodialysis hypernatraemia and metabolic alkalosis developed; both were reversible after discontinuation of GHB and restriction of additional sodium input (Somsanit, the commercially available GHB preparation in Germany, contains 9.2 mmol sodium/g; the daily dose averages 20-40 g GHB, i.e.	3.339026159313662
In Europe ultrasonography has displaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in the primary survey of polytraumatized patients with suspected abdominal trauma.	3.6135062572638086
Hemodynamically unstable patients who are brought to the emergency room with blunt abdominal trauma will go directly to the operating room after a rapid ultrasonography examination with evidence of hemoperitoneum.	3.7410545111601428
In hemodynamically stable patients, in addition to ultrasonography, computed tomography can be done.	4.114207571796189
This is especially efficient if evaluation with sonography is not completely possible or shows little pathology (e.g.	2.7981550747585846
small amounts of hemoperitoneum).	3.583497553173933
We report on a posttraumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk, something which is rather rare.	2.992693699851243
The injury was caused by blunt chest trauma following a car accident.	3.265730609654583
Computed tomography could not find the brachiocephalic lesion.	3.138870376906551
In patients with fractures of the upper ribs after blunt chest trauma, angiography should be done to exclude severe injuries of the aorta and brachiocephalic vessels.	4.087280901221859
Even after the strengthening by the law of 1997, the German criminal law regarding corruption is no obstacle for cooperation between medical research and industry.	3.2120047497285937
The injustice of corruption is an irregular exchange between performing one's duty and benefits.	2.8236247499549734
According to this, an enterprise may give funds to a scientist for research purposes if no counter performance exceeding the research is associated with this.	3.454382947218687
However, it makes a difference if the scientist has to show his appreciation by influencing economic decisions of the clinic in favor of the enterprise.	3.0467434260533537
In case of such an injustice, it is, under the new law, no longer important if the benefit is destined for the scientist himself or for another person or organization.	3.3367158383824287
A prerequisite for this is the strict observance of the legal and administrative regulations concerning projects financed by third-party funds.	3.1169774366135714
Since the immune system plays an important role in the rejection of tumours, current tumour therapy includes immunostimulation.	3.2951884587657148
This can be done by interleukin 2 (Il-2), which activates T and killer cells and induces lysis of the tumour.	3.6623583421048793
Because the intravenous application of Il-2 may have serious side effects, we treated two patients with peritumoral injections in a pilot study.	3.6297295042454722
Both patients suffered from multiple cutaneous metastases of melanoma.	3.492455980726387
A total of 31 and 39x106 IU recombinant Il-2 (Proleukin) respectively was injected in increasing concentrations in one metastasis of each patient.	3.2374655578411615
Histologically, almost complete necrosis of the tumour was induced.	4.122468394900411
In comparison with the control specimen, the T-cell-rich infiltrate increased intra- and, in particular, peritumorally.	3.616007347788358
While the ratio of helper to suppressor T cells remained unchanged, the proportions of NK cells, monocytes/macrophages and IL-2-receptor-bearing cells increased.	3.706777433734505
This reaction was restricted to treated metastases.	3.327748383014478
No clinical side effects or laboratory changes were registered apart from local erythema and swelling.	3.257690394068623
Wear of the articulating components (especially PE-UHMW) of total hip endoprostheses is the most important technical factor limiting the functional lifetime.	3.657863909396718
To minimize wear debris, ceramic heads, according to ISO 6474 (Al2O3), have been used, from 1969 paired with Al2O3 and since 1975 paired with PE-UHMW.	3.173011790942054
The articulating surfaces of retrieved ceramic heads (Al2O3 - Biolox) and cementless CFRP cups (carbon fiber reinforced plastic, Caproman) were compared using sphericity measurement techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and roughness measurements (including advanced roughness parameters Rvk or Rpk according to ISO 4287).	2.7402871472765917
Altogether, the first results of the clinical study showed that the combination Al2O3-ball/CFRP-cup came up to the expected lower wear rates compared with the conventional combinations.	4.542753268647301
The wear rates are comparable with the combination Al2O3/Al2O3 without the material-related problems of ceramic components in all ceramic combinations.	3.2671307207954015
Two cases where DNA typing has been carried out for stain analysis are described.	3.2746201279702016
In both cases Y chromosomal STR systems have been used in combination with autosomal STR systems.	3.7905209854949726
In the first case the DNA from the fingernails of a female victim with skin particles of the male murderer was typed.	3.0407076258638925
The male DNA in this mixture of male and female DNA could be typed.	3.26622113204862
The excess of female DNA in the samples did not distrub the PCR reaction of Y-chromosomal systems.	3.0343877223804867
The typing of the suspect's DNA did not give any information because of a family relationship.	3.452931302957992
Different kinds of stains have been analysed with DYS 389 I/II, DYS 390, DYS 391, DYS 392 DYS 393 and DYS19.	2.749660146439238
Two multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to save time and stain material.	3.5152167362031745
Although the Y-chromosomal systems are not as polymorphic as autosomal STR systems the analysis of combined haplotypes can give additional information in forensic casework.	3.16880755430907
In a prospectively designed randomized study, we compared the efficacy of sublingual nitroglycerine and intravenous enalaprilat in the out-of-hospital treatment of 46 hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema (defined as rales over both lungs and systolic blood pressure >200 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure >100 mg).	2.9510297045936595
The out-of-hospital treatment consists of oxygen (6 Ll/min) via a face mask, furosemide 80 mg i.v., opioids 10 mg s.c., and either sublingual nitroglycerine (n=23; initial dose: 0.8 mg; repetitive application of 0.8 mg every 10 min until a cumulative dose of 3.2 mg) or intravenous enalaprilat (initial dose: 2.5 mg; repetitive application of 2.5 mg every 30 min until a cumulative dose of 10 mg).	2.817554113586436
The aim of the antihypertensive treatment was a reduction of systolic blood pressure below 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg until admission to the emergency department.	3.0483253588219497
In the emergency room, an arterial and venous blood sample was taken to determine the respiratory (pO2, pCO2) and metabolic status (pH value; base-excess; serum lactate) of the patient.	3.6503563314115066
Successful antihypertensive treatment was observed in 13/23 (57%) patients of the enalaprilat group and 15/23 (65%) patients of the nitroglycerine group (p=0.54).	3.8057040516254763
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure on admission were similiar in both treatment groups (systolic RR: enalaprilat: 179 [31] mm Hg; nitroglycerine: 184 [38] mm Hg; p=0.59; diastolic RR: enalaprilat: 96 [14] mm Hg; nitroglycerine: 101 [14] mm Hg; p=0.12).	3.006479849552882
No significant differences were observed between the enalaprilat and the nitroglycerine groups concerning respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission (pO2: 67 [15] vs. 64 [17] mm Hg; p=0.50; pCO2: 46 [9] vs. 47 [13]; p=0.75; pH value: 7.27 [0.12] vs. 7.27 [0.09]; p=0.98; BE: -4.2 [3.7] vs. -5.7 [4.1]; p=0.23; lactate: 4.2 [3.3] vs. 4.2 [2.7]; p=0.98).	2.4033085738877187
Intravenous enalaprilat did not exhibit any advantage compared to nitroglycerine in terms of blood pressure reduction or respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission to the emergency room.	3.4186741750067005
We conclude that enalaprilat is no substitute for nitroglycerine in the out-of-hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema.	2.6166561870944105
They can be develop at anyage, but most often in the third or fourth decade of life.	3.0367282822405746
Paragangliomas grow very slowly and are most always of benign origin.	3.178772029900691
There is a familial predisposition, and an autosomal-dominant transmission is presumed.	3.334430062562807
They are commonly located in the jugular region; in rare cases a polytopic manifestation is found.	3.640076240200643
We describe the case of a 47-year-old male patient who was referred to our department because of a progressive swelling of the neck on both sides.	3.568023635701461
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography had displayed soft tissue tumors in the jugular regions.	3.351330622160775
We performed an operative exploration, which showed a highly vascularized tumor.	3.371600463204024
Histopathologic analysis revealed the diagnosis of a paraganglioma.	4.584411900192108
An angiography of the neck and thoracic region, furthermore, revealed an additional paraganglioma in the anterior mediastinum.	3.69337295405254
Our case report demonstrates the rare polytopic manifestation of paragangliomas.	2.9185746672396085
This perivascular neoplasms have to be removed before haemodynamic complications develop.	3.619726886318916
Because of the familial predisposition, clinical and radiological examinations of relatives are mandatory.	3.1519479127777834
In more than 30 years of development of intensive care medicine (ICM), our speciality has acquired moral and ethical standpoints, although not without public pressure and discussions.	3.251839325444153
Special commissions dealing, e.g., with brain death, terminal care, ethics of foregoing life-sustaining treatment in the critically ill, withholding or withdrawing mechanical ventilation, and other issues have meen formed in a number of medical societies.	3.4386760544874524
International consensus conferences have helped to clarify some of the issues.	3.5759917879307457
With increasing experience, a multitude of ethical problems have arisen in ICM that have to be dealt with, such as the issue of quality of life.	3.6745883032224538
What is an unworthy life?	3.8471797350232917
Are we allowed to make judgments for our patients?	3.8563050002080512
What is cost-effectiveness in ICM?	4.257154758207463
Other restrictions include bed and equipment shortages in the intensive care unit (ICU), the necessity for triage - undisputed in catastrophe medicine - and how one should proceed in managing elective patients?	3.19729525943381
In situations of limited ICU bed availability, sicker patients will be admitted, sparing out patients who are less ill for observation and those with poor quality of life and poor prognosis.	3.401785637827323
For the future, it will likely be necessary to define the patients who should be admitted to an ICU more than those who should not be admitted.	3.9999695418676238
The ICU outcome with survival, hospital mortality, and follow-up of ICU patients is considered.	3.840955137339736
Outcome predictions using scores (APACHE III, SAPS II, MPM) have been developed based on previous experience, but should only be applied to patient groups and for quality assurance in ICUs.	3.560526871870928
The most frequent and difficult problem in the ICU is the vegetative state, which requires an exact diagnosis.	3.297138734717164
The ethics of interrupting life-sustaining treatment in critically ill patients have been worked out by a Task Force on Ethics of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (1990).	2.9024492571690104
A consensus was found that the patient may judge to forego therapy; ethically it is then appropriate to withhold or withdraw therapy.	3.3269356479624883
According to the consensus, withdrawing an already initiated treatment should not necessarily be regarded as more problematic than a decision not to initiate treatment.	3.1563092792727088
In my mind, however, there is a great difference between withdrawing or withholding, e.g., ventilation.	3.7348373561026085
A dissentive opinion by some members of the Task Force stated that hydration and nutrition other than high-technology or parenteral nutrition are key components of patient care, and should not be equated with medical intervention.	3.320074450006422
The ethical problems associated with active euthanasia (physician-assisted suicide or death) as practised in the Netherlands are also discussed.	3.024212232340175
In most countries this practice seems unacceptable.	2.965004048803583
From 30 years experience in ICM, there are many more ethical questions and case reports without clear solutions.	3.4381831354406627
Care decisions for single patients in unacceptable situations should be made after medical evaluation by the intensivist with the medical team and, if possible, by the patient and/or his or her surrogate.	4.2078529166361935
Legislation and solutions cannot be expected for single patients, but ethics committees could be helpful in decision-making.	3.5518075026696536
Pseudarthroses of the spine are classified into congenital, acquired non-traumatic, posttraumatic and postoperative (iatrogenic) pseudarthroses.	3.383526190190017
In line with their clinical importance, special attention with respect to the operative treatment is given to non-union of the axis of C2 and to spondylolysis.	4.542251850959504
For the pseudarthrosis of the dens a posterior fusion according to Gallie-Brooks is recommended, in spondylolyses without marked slipping a "direct repair" should be considered in young patients.	3.052720329389243
207 osteosarcomas were examined morphologically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to the COSS-86 protocol using representative slides of one whole tumor plane.	3.197790048402195
The rate of responders 63 %.	3.0332426160414827
In relapse-free patients both the whole tumors and the vital areas there of were smaller than in patients with relapse during a follow-up period of 5 years.	3.7719602360986846
Within the subgroup of osteoblastic osteosarcomas, metastases were observed following smaller tumors than in chondroblastic osteosarcomas.	3.0710769626025343
Therefore, in addition to degree of regression, histological subtype and tumor size should be considered in the prognostic evaluation of osteosarcomas.	3.1036658754602744
The possibilities of using different material combinations for the replacement of knee joint endoprostheses are very limited.	3.067708694156105
Therefore, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys are currently being used for femoral components and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for tribologically stressed tibial components.	2.7983786515287337
Titanium alloys can be considered for the tibial component only.	4.066058513269428
The fixation of hamstring grafts in ACL reconstruction requires a connector device.	3.0142363781021246
During the process of ingrowing the graft stability depends entirely on the fixation.	3.04233182900991
The following study focused on the mechanical conditions of no 6 Ethibond, 5 mm Mersilene tape and 5 mm Polylene tape.	3.0649315691825283
The material were tested as loops with a length of 30 mm including the knot similar to intraoperative conditions.	3.0348911539779215
The ultimate tension load and elongation of the conditioned and unconditioned loops were investigated under cyclic load of 50 N and 100 N using a tension load machine.	2.839043392010016
The ultimate tension load increased significantly only for Mersilene from 416 N to 462 N. However, the highest ultimate tension load showed Polylene with 479 N. The oscillating load up to 100 N revealed for unconditioned loops and elongation of 4.1 mm for Ethibond, 2.9 mm for Polylene and 5.4 mm for Mersilene.	2.8235454640113455
The elongation decreased significantly for the conditioned loops to a maximum of 1.4 mm.	3.3615330118959452
Concerning the amplitude during the period of oscillating load there was found a significant reduction as well.	3.758719506857148
Based on our results Polylene showed the best mechanical properties.	3.0347136606627902
Regardless the intraoperatively used material we advocate the conditioning of the loops before anchoring the hamstring graft in ACL reconstruction.	2.8525470215098836
On the basis of the results of 327 knee arthroscopies in children aged between 2 and 17 years in the period from 1985 to 1995 we attempt to evaluate the current status of this procedure.	3.8006308341484036
Arthroscopy as a diagnostic intervention in trauma with haemarthrosis or in any kind of knee effusion is progressively being replaced by sophisticated ultrasound techniques or MRI.	3.105134938382558
This trend shows a predominant therapeutic use of knee arthroscopy.	3.1335116516923756
Taking our own "incorrect" clinical diagnoses as a starting point we look at common problems in the accurate clinical examination of the symptomatic knee in younger children.	3.1973870158038302
Rational utilization of all kinds of modern diagnostic measures will reduce purely diagnostic arthroscopies in favour of therapeutic endoscopic interventions thus reducing perioperative risks to a minimum.	3.0593803408688225
The pathogenesis of cortical blindness as a rare complication in severe preeclampsia is still unclear.	3.0370473252987993
The case of a women with postpartum blindness is reported in which CT and MRI initially showed cortical and subcortical edema in the parieto-occipital lobes.	3.2029546467457735
Mean blood flow velocities in the middle and posterior cerebral artery and carotid syphon initially reached 380 cm/s and normalized within 2 weeks.	2.9096812640037024
While the patient's vision improved rapidly, follow-up MRI disclosed ischemic lesions and petechial hemorrhage in the occipital cortex.	3.2714809934829945
This case provides rare documentation that transient blindness in patients with preeclampsia may result from parieto-occipital ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm.	3.432807194668384
In such patients TCCS may be useful to detect vasospasm associated with preeclampsia/eclampsia.	3.0979135286543857
The principle of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for rheumatoid arthritis consists in specifically concentrating a drug (photosensitizer) in the synovium.	3.093811343709274
Subsequent activation of the photosensitizer by means of a laser leads to a cytotoxic effect.	4.48850566432662
The practicability of PDT was tested in an animal model of IgG-induced arthritis in rabbits.	3.4265839285745616
Photosan-3, 5-aminolevulinic acid and BPD-MA were administered intraarticularly or intravenously.	3.408668768522926
In this model, concentration of the photosensitizer in the synovial lining cells, the lymphoid infiltrate, and the skin was seen.	4.328243601271856
After laser irradiation a selective demarcation and destruction of the synovium by prior administration of Photosan-3, not constant by BPD-MA and without therapeutic effect by 5-aminolevulinic acid, was observed.	3.0292270121517277
In contrast, bradytrophic tissues such as cartilage, meniscus, and ligament structures were changed neither macroscopically nor microscopically in all series.	2.6813892742359258
PDT thus offers ideal preconditions for minimal invasive treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases because of its selectivity and efficacy.	3.71235981229306
Photodynamic laser therapy can be considered a new method in the surgical treatment of inflammatory disease of the synovial membrane.	4.7748214888098675
The purpose of the study was to identify associations between drug prescriptions and the risk of falls in community-dwelling frail elderly people.	3.152660930950255
Enlargement of the prostate is an age-related, physiological process that is unique in human tissue.	3.9122850715467297
The prostate gland is the most common site of neoplastic disorders in men.	3.9847574054683275
Despite the growing impact of the various prostate diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality, the pathogenesis of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer remains poorly understood.	3.7789973143074667
This reflects the complex composition of the gland with different anatomic, cellular and functional compartments that are differentially involved in benign and malignant disease processes.	3.1054982424181294
The present review summarizes new concepts on the morphogenesis of normal and abnormal growth in the human prostate.	3.2779446640393175
There is increasing evidence that prostatic stem cells are located in the basal cell layer that is basically involved in normal growth and the development of glandular hyperplasia and prostate cancer.	3.5651830517575074
High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is considered the most likely precursor of clinically important cancer of the peripheral zone.	3.538367015848683
Severe differentiation and proliferation abnormalities occur during malignant transformation of the prostatic epithelium.	3.2829928585546275
These premalignant changes are associated with abnormal expression of growth factor receptors, oncogene and suppressor gene products and genetic instability.	3.1806613612830534
During the process of stromal invasion the transformed cells lose their basal cell phenotype and produce basement mem- brane-like matrices.	2.61556243457511
Common prostate cancer is mainly composed of exocrine cell types that remain androgen-responsive even in hormone-independent disease.	2.932228289810473
The frequent occurrence of neuroendocrine differentiation in common prostate cancer reflects the differentiation potency of its stem cells.	3.0175063148651793
The endocrine phenotype derives from exocrine tumor cells via intermediate (amphicrine) cell types.	2.830192270941931
Neuroendocrine tumor cells consistently lack the nuclear androgen receptor and represent an androgen-insensitive cell population in prostate cancer.	3.2059939717919876
Questionnaires were mailed anonymously to 150 German shock wave centers.	2.773258173372666
Twenty questions addressed the following areas of interest: - Facilities of the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) center (technical, personnel, laboratory, etc.)	2.894593578378371
- Cooperation at ESWL center with referring urologists - Laboratory facilities versus actual metabolic work-up.	2.8248299842515063
The return rate was 114 of 150 (76 %).	3.0051133544986817
Surprisingly, at 58 % of the centers the average number of treatments is less than two per day.	3.348440243884991
In 30 % of the centers only chemical stone analysis is done!	3.504668692642395
The final conclusion was that ESWL has largely replaced the causal metabolic work-up and subsequent metaphylaxis as a symptomatic measure against urolithiasis.	3.0709954127094785
Based on current insurance data patients with pseudophakia can be expected to suffer reduced stereoacuity.	3.0747571779895093
In 1970 Aulhorn and Harms made fundamental recommendations for the night driving ability of motorists as well as for the corresponding examination methods.	3.2707432157177756
Reduced night driving ability of persons over the age of 60, as well the established limits for twilight vision and glare sensitivity, and their relevance to night-time collisions has been re-examined.	3.6297182998764046
Hernias of the obturator foramen are rare.	3.3489414718619392
They are described mostly in elderly female patients in poor health.	3.1792188111678334
Often the correct diagnosis is stumbled upon as a result of surprising intraoperative findings.	3.511992079453437
Surgical therapy is indicated often by the clinical symptoms of an incarcerated hernia.	3.662211540761615
Herniation of the entire urinary bladder with hemorrhagic infarction has never been described before.	3.5591928568140068
For an anatomical reduction of the hernia it was neccesary to resect the superior pubic ramus.	3.189026838200581
For plastic reconstruction a marlex mesh was used.	3.118815368279643
ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft has become a standard procedure.	3.5865109057725006
The graft can be inserted either using two tunnels and a lateral femoral incision or with a femoral half tunnel drilled from the joint, thus avoiding the lateral incision.	3.4521692977554475
Advantages of the single-incision technique in the early rehabilitation period have been claimed.	3.7791031726856854
40 patients with ACL deficiency were included in a prospective randomized trial comparing single and two-incision technique with a follow-up period of 4 years.	3.6119018263912075
Preoperative data did not show any significant difference between the two groups.	2.8406939463304464
At follow-up no differences were observed with respect to complications or the progress of rehabilitation.	4.409997905349451
Evaluation after 1 and 4 years according to the IKDC form revealed good to excellent results in 70 % of all patients.	3.7324593161188826
The Tegner-score increased significantly, however most patients did not regain their former activity level.	2.9629538656808347
ACL-reconstruction reduced anterior translation of the knee significantly at 6 months follow-up.	3.5221409578666854
However, we observed a slight increase of anterior translation after 1 and 4 years in both groups; stability was comparable in both groups at all time periods.	3.689171999771516
We conclude that an arthroscopic singleincision technique has no advantage compared to a mini-open two-incision technique for ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft in terms of subjective or objective parameters.	3.2272718623402743
For determining the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Germany, the outcomes of several epidemiological studies are available.	4.073776531909425
If these rates are transferred to Germany as a whole, figures result of 67,000 to 138,000 MS patients in all.	3.1279883532700214
The differing prevalence rates may be caused by various problems in finding patients, the epidemiological area, and different population structures.	3.7413103932041185
To avoid these difficulties, a new approach for calculating the number of patients with diagnosed MS was chosen based on representative samples taken from the groups of physicians involved in MS treatment.	3.804983197543925
The disadvantage of this approach is that it does not allow any questioning of the diagnosis.	4.176105212932707
Projecting the results in this way and their subsequent compilation - taking "double treatments" into consideration - showed a total of 122,000 patients with diagnosed multiple sclerosis in Germany.	3.8105514846163384
This figure corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is within the range found by Poser et al.	2.687977695948684
[19]: 127 per 100,000 excluding the diagnostic category "possible multiple sclerosis" and 170 per 100,000 including it.	3.112925617073204
The chemical synthesis of alkyl glucuronides, which appear as metabolites in urine after the consumption of beverages containing congeners of ethanol, is described.	2.9635584677567444
Glucuronides of the following alcohols were synthesized: methanol, d5-ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, R-(-)-2-butanol, S-(+)-2-butanol, isopentanol and S-(-)-2-methylbutanol.	2.8780008442986227
The retention indices of acetyl, pentafluorpropyl (PFP) and trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives are given and discussed in relation to the chemical structures.	3.0015357977153765
Mass spectra of homologous derivatives were shown to be very similar but some fragments were specific for the chain length of the alkyl moiety and can be used for identification and a quantitative estimation of glucuronides in urine samples.	3.5529674837271994
Decreasing numbers of tuberculosis cases in the western countries have led to diminished attention towards this disease.	3.7406220863320243
But worldwide, tuberculosis still is the leading cause of mortality due to any one single infectious agent.	3.3680703551976414
In the industrialized countries, immigration, growth of low-income groups and increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients, mainly due to the HIV epidemic, supply a reservoir for tuberculosis.	3.6601361260642187
Five efficient STR systems were investigated by automated laser fluorescence analysis on an A.L.F.	3.1810027198080673
The system HumACTBP2 and the combinations of the systems HumVWA/FGA and HumTH01/D12S391 in duplex reactions were analysed.	2.6543920705688313
DNA samples could be analysed with a high sensitivity (100 pg) and the results were reproducible.	4.706042186744449
No allele drop-out was observed.	3.2480532422982873
Using specific allelic ladders, the inter and intra gel deviation was less than 0.5 bp.	3.0931631636094172
The allele frequencies, the mean exclusion chance values and the discrimination power  for all five systems are shown.	3.4242874205915426
The combination of the five systems resulted in a power of discrimination of 99.9999989%.	3.2102795130998123
Few technological developments have impacted health sciences over the last years like the internet.	3.823478862808211
This comes at a time when electronic acquisition, storage and processing of medical data becomes commonplace in the so-called developed countries.	3.3095688877684712
New forms of integrated medical services will eventually evolve from these two trends.	3.0992033746963994
For information taken from many medical resources on the internet a relative lack of review processes requires special care and selection.	2.9479181987483996
The co-operation of different health providers can be facilitated using technological standards initially established for other purposes.	2.85757932266248
This article is directed towards the gynecologist interested in practical use of the internet and its technologies and critically reviews the value of sample sites on the net.	3.391858803676145
A calculation model was developed for the cost of stone therapy and metaphylaxis in Germany based on estimates of stone incidence, types and recurrence rates, actual costs for stone removal and metaphylaxis (based on data from a district of the social health care system).	3.45130624867644
There are 200,000 stone recurrences per year in Germany.	3.0972006057392134
Cost for treatment of these stones amount to $687,000,000.	3.9663986451513167
Stone metaphylaxis reduces the recurrence rate by some 40 %.	3.4934909819514406
The annual cost for stone removal could be lowered by $275,300,000.	3.020792483722459
Metabolic evaluation/metaphylaxis amount to $70,100,000 per year, resulting in an net saving of $205,200,000.	3.603715896932535
In 1997, there were 96 days off-work per stone patient resulting in 5,800,000 days off-work in Germany per year.	3.0878102942242607
Metaphylaxis in stone formers can lower health care cost significantly.	3.0675263416088105
Although health care conditions may vary from country to country, in principle this calculation model is applicable also to other countries.	3.0640929955502214
Consideration of estrogen replacement therapy is well established in the treatment of postmenopausal syndrome and osteoporosis in menopause.	4.353159384271439
Some observational epidemiologic studies on this topic have suggested beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease.	3.155240812765302
A prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trial with respect to cardiovascular events and mortality in postmenopausal hormone users, the HERS (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement) study has recently been published.	3.406068885542329
Antiischemic effects of estrogens are mediated by improvement of menopausal-associated endothelial dysfunction, calcium antagonism, and activation of endothelial synthesis of prostacyclin.	3.1020244388500453
Improvement in functional state and reduction of stress-induced myocardial ischemia with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been demonstrated in several clinical trials.	3.622537591855868
Inflammatory stimuli induce the expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells.	3.3170240051221462
The adhesive forces between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium are antagonized by the shear stress of the flowing blood.	3.135712196563238
The aim of this study was to examine how differences in the apparent wall shear rate measured in iris venules with varying caliber affect leukocyte-endothelium interaction.	2.528042592423161
Radiologic means aid in assessment of the most suitable side for operation and allow the surgeon to be prepared for special situations in order to perform the operation without difficulties [22].	4.729061932942259
The most suitable modalities are CT and MRI preoperatively.	3.3278173413761563
In uncomplicated cases, conventional imaging suffices for the postoperative needs.	3.3803784876878207
CT should only be performed if the patient complains of symptoms.	3.507016725407263
Systemic immunotherapy, notably with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN), has yielded a response rate of 10 % to 30 % in metastic renal cell carcinoma.	3.299745517504816
However, systemic immunotherapy is limited by severe side effects, and long-lasting response is rare.	4.344740747166498
Tumor palliation and quality-of-life are important end points for evaluating the clinical benefits of immunotherapy.	3.330593144801859
Experimental and clinical treatment models have proved that local IL-2 application is less toxic than systemic treatment and is therapeutically effective.	3.4575719128055917
Here we report long-term experience with inhalation IL-2 therapy in 188 patients who had progressive pulmonary metastatic renal cell carcinoma.	3.594854560876465
High-dose inhalation of IL-2 was used with low-dose systemic IL-2 or IFN.	4.01127020610552
Maximal toxicity over the total treatment time was mild, and the low incidence of WHO grade 3 toxicity (24 %) allowed social activities and peformance of social roles.	3.6896792924489903
Comedication for systemic side effects was required only in half of the patients.	3.434112980241295
Inhaled IL-2 prevented progress of pulmonary metastases in 68 % of patients for a median period of 9.8 months.	3.776445740788372
Median survival was 12.4 months compared with the expected 5.3 months and quality-of-life did not differ substantially from pretreatment status.	3.4326061125288043
Local treatment can be applied alone or in combination with systemic therapy and can increase therapeutic efficacy.	3.976085111909603
It is now well known that chronic alcohol abuse is an important factor for developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).	3.7671635974154163
While hospitalized, these patients are at great risk for developing an unexpected alcohol-withdrawal syndrome.	3.0925602798479397
Compared to common markers of alcohol abuse, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) has been found to be more sensitive and specific.	3.2982593494918513
It is therefore very useful for detecting alcoholism and controlling compliance of alcohol withdrawal.	3.042252498010986
We analyzed the serum concentrations of CDT, liver enzymes and mean corpuscular volume in 49 male patients with HNSCC.	3.07774671609673
Elevated CDT levels were found in more than 25% of patients who earlier denied a history of chronic alcohol abuse.	4.714307983651947
Over one-third of these patients developed an alcohol-withdrawal syndrome.	3.732733214380665
These findings demonstrated that analysis of elevated CDT serum levels was a valuable method for detecting chronic alcohol abuse and recognizing patients at risk for developing an alcohol-withdrawal syndrome postoperatively.	3.0027087094570244
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an essential role in specific cell deletion during normal embryonal and adult development.	3.155616396751479
Apoptotic cells are characterized by fragmentation of nuclear DNA and formation of apoptotic bodies.	3.434114740494628
Molecular genetic analysis has revealed the involvement of several deaths and survival genes that are regulated by extracellular and intracellular factors.	3.1050786797508816
There are multiple inducers and inhibitors which interact with target cellspecific receptors and transduce signals involved in cellular proliferation, cell cycle progression and programmed cell death.	2.7569402256538327
The elimination of tumor cell populations by applying lethal doses of chemotherapeutic agents or radiation is a well-established strategy in cancer therapy.	3.1401387587567506
Although improved cytotoxic chemo- and radiotherapy regimens are available, the efficacy of these strategies is still disappointing with regard to many solid tumors.	3.531421472842393
Better understanding of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis, including death genes, death signals, receptors and signal transduction pathways, will provide new approaches in the development of strategies to regulate malignant cell survival and death.	3.661476713474143
Recent discoveries in the field of apoptotic cell death promise to have a significant impact on antitumor therapies.	3.7271164295281696
Apoptosis is known to be an active process which can be artificially manipulated by several molecular pathways.	3.97826598219864
This information concerning the regulation and induction of programmed cell death might lead among otherthings, to the development of new powerful means to eliminate malignant cell populations of otherwise resistant genitourinary tumors such as prostate cancer.	3.404373883752053
We report on a 63-year-old female patient with Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS).	2.574830142468315
In the course of this disease two carcinomas of the colon, a kerato-acanthoma and multiple sebaceous gland tumours, including four sebaceous gland tumours, including four sebaceous carcinomas, appeared.	3.102862836443688
This case is thought to be a heriditary form as one of daughters was also found to have a sebaceous epithelioma.	4.097906290301948
MTS is a mostly autosomal-dominant disease with the association of sebaceous gland tumours and internal carcinomas.	3.604359493087201
As the malignant tumours only show slight aggressiveness the prognosis is quite favourable.	3.286398632307309
Oral isotretinoin therapy was successfully used for the inhibition of sebaceous gland proliferation.	4.1140737523281965
A narrower definition is presented and an updated survey of the published cases is given.	3.612981336016139
Furthermore, the histopathologic peculiarities of sebaceous gland tumours, especially of sebaceous gland carcinomas, are discussed and compared to sebaceous gland tumours not connected with MTS.	3.6080288429599405
A total number of 100 of the 135 published cases of MTS were included and analysed regarding sebaceous gland tumours and other skin tumours.	3.224391886155099
The data on internal carcinomas were taken from the work of Cohen et al.	3.074798951459597
(1991) and 11 current cases were added.	3.697075579163633
The rapid development of modern endovascular, microsurgical, and radiation therapies has considerably expanded the treatment options for encephalic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).	2.883364693180593
Surgery has the longest history.	3.524428838445927
Single or staged intravascular procedures (embolizations) using fast-acting glues, sclerotic agents, and thrombogenic coils serve to reduce the size of AVM to that suitable for extirpation and may reduce the risk of surgery.	3.4604341588381202
Radiation ("gamma-knife") therapy, most frequently used in small, non-operable AVMs, is also viewed by some authors as an alternative or even superior tool in small, operable malformations.	3.731780049971434
Partial embolization to reduce the mass-effect of space-occupying AVMs, to reverse diaschisis, and to treat AVM-related seizure disorders is being discussed and practiced.	3.521080333167532
Given the in part competing or even controversial options, the selection of optimal treatment for AVM patients is becoming increasingly difficult.	3.236168836637828
Current management is impeded by the paucity of information on the exact risks of invasive therapies and by insufficient criteria for identifying patients at risk of spontaneous bleeding during the natural course, including the seriousness of such hemorrhage.	3.5625398988789483
A new "all in one" sensing device was developed for continuous transtracheal intraoperative monitoring and in situ detection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroid surgery.	3.1627190740906412
Patients and methods: The new system is based on a double-balloon endotracheal tube with integrated atraumatic stimulating and tracing electrodes.	3.270096722575514
Fifty-five patients were introduced into a phase-one clinical trial.	3.365524708364444
Thirty-five patients with primary thyroid operations, 20 patients with reoperations, 10 of whom had neck dissections.	3.64994346520663
All patients were evaluated laryngoscopically and phoniatrically by an ENT specialist before and after surgery.	3.212647805583413
Results: Compound muscle action potentials were recorded continuously during the whole operation and responded sensitively to tension and pressure to the nerve.	3.064204403584102
There were no accidental permanent RLN palsies.	2.700756285696436
Conclusion: The new system offers five advantages: (1) it is atraumatic; (2) it is easy to use; (3) it can monitor continuously with an audio feedback to the surgeon; (4) it works outside the operation field; and (5) it is highly sensitive, even indicating reversible irritation to the nerve.	3.913630340269686
The diagnosis of primary malignant bone tumors, which only account for 1% of malignancies in humans, represents quite a challange for the pathologist.	3.3687625029685764
Apart from the often overlapping morphology between different entities, heterogeneity within one and the same tumor has to be kept in mind.	2.898746857070269
Furthermore, in most cases the diagnosis must be established based on small biopsy specimens and occasionally even on frozen sections.	3.1995102935068833
In this context detailed clinical information including the patient's age and exact localization of the tumor, as depicted by X-ray or MRI, are essential requirements for a correct diagnosis.	3.5803010315059063
In addition, multiple biopsies from different tumor sites may be of help.	3.3304621254786726
For example, 25% of osteogenic sarcomas (OSA) are chondroplastic.	2.8245252991324574
Others may contain areas similar to fibrosarcoma (FSA) or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH).	2.6227271138321444
Since 90% of OSA occur in the second decade of life whereas chondrosarcomas, FSA and MFH usually manifest after the age of 40 years, a biopsy solely composed of malignant chondromatous tissue obtained from a tibial lesion of a 10-year-old child should most likely be considered as part of an OSA.	3.5413359231781154
In the differential diagnosis of the so-called small, round cell tumors, which include Ewing sarcoma, malignant lymphoma and small-cell OSA, immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin-embedded material and a molecular biological/genetic work-up of frozen material are most helpful.	3.6891365327396266
In this paper the histomorphological characteristics and criteria for differential diagnosis of the most common primary malignant bone tumors are discussed.	3.886164166600146
The care of the patient after primary treatment is very important for both tumor control and patientsi compliance.	4.519677857902657
The aim of this care concept should be the early detection of local recurrences so as to have better secondary treatment (maybe cure) options.	3.423230648620395
If expensive diagnostics are needed to get this information, it is reasonable to order them.	4.006625370540261
If there is no benefit for the patient, regarding survival or with respect to quality of life, clinical anamnesis and examination should be preferred.	4.463295288663878
The effect on pain and heat sensation of monomere non-ionic contrast media with different osmolality was assessed in a randomized double-blind study.	2.913382135940722
Peripheral angiography was performed in 29 patients who suffered from chronic occlusive vessel disease.	4.131366905339631
The two non-ionic contrast media iomeprol and iopentol were applied intraindividually.	2.715129057591044
The contrast media with an iodine concentration of 350 mg/ml had an osmolality of 618 or 810 mosm/kg.	2.9564478137032797
A contrast medium volume of 80 or 90 ml was injected in the abdominal aorta.	3.5808522329014667
The mean flow was 13.9 ml/s.	3.211193920231569
The two contrast medium injections were separated by an interval of 10 min.	3.370977595494573
No analgesic premedication was given.	3.5215639957982603
The pain and heat intensity was semiquantatively measured using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (no heat/pain) to 100 (intractable heat/pain).	3.0359519913704758
The median after the first injection was calculated as 40 for iomeprol and 70 for iopentol.	3.4172210516478687
The comparison of heat and pain sensations after the second injection showed a less distinct difference with a scale rating of 60 for iomeprol and of 65 for iopentol.	2.9150615784656706
The statistical variance was highly significant (p < 0.01) in favor of iomeprol.	3.965602957096726
Shampooing is the most common form of hair treatment.	4.632172782730858
Shampoos have primarily been products aimed at cleansing the hair and scalp.	3.145742319850182
The diversity of qualities demanded from a good shampoo by today's consumer go far beyond this general function.	2.774715802893014
A cosmetic benefit is expected, and the shampoo formulation has to be tailored to all the possible variations associated with hair quality (dry, greasy, permed, bleached, dyed), age (baby shampoo), care habit (frequency of shampooing) and specific problems relating to the superficial condition of the scalp (dandruff, seborrhea).	3.181362141790986
Selected ingredients of shampoos that have been popular with the consumer are currently under attack because of potential risks associated with their use (e. g. halogenated organic compounds, formaldehyde, musk fragrances, and crude coal tar).	2.990834640386063
Our standard graduate training programs devote limited attention to  the subject of shampoos, and much of the readily available information concerning shampoos is supplied by the industry.	2.9636384184212097
We should be increasingly aware that our patients look to us to supply independent information on what can be expected from a shampoo to enable them to make more informed choices at the consumer level.	3.113869913915838
In industrialized countries the rate of sudden cardiac death remains unchanged.	4.2574039251903955
The most frequently encountered structural heart disease in these patients is coronary artery disease.	3.7798192095405496
Despite the era of thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction patients carry an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmogenic death within a time period of one to two years following the acute event.	3.621373747756234
Therefore, risk stratification post-MI before patient discharge is furthermore mandatory.	2.8038468910438064
Dysphagia is related to the impairment of food passage from the mouth to the stomach.	3.624603541737163
Globus pharyngis implies the frequent and often painful sensation of a lump in the throat that usually does not interfere with swallowing and may even be relieved by food intake.	2.8581123420183436
Structural lesions of the cervical spine such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis are rare causes of dysphagia.	3.6577804913800525
Dysphagia following anterior cervical fusion as well as globus and dysphonia due to dysfunction of the vertebral joints are more likely.	4.1947701364610515
Symptoms with swallowing fluids indicate a neurogenic origin.	3.2261111803677074
Dyscoordinated swallowing, nasal reflux, dysphonia or general weakness may also occur.	3.3654575139984346
Chronic aspiration with respiratory compromize is the main consequence in a variety of neurological disorders as well as in cases of postsurgical dysphagia.	4.426440926038031
Relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter indicates coordinated muscle movement between the pharynx and esophagus.	3.4379801677758963
Dysfunction of the pharyngoesophageal segment may lead to cricopharyngeal achalasia.	3.43084322673165
A dyskinetic sphincter commonly represents an extrapharyngeal cause: i.e., disease associated with gastroesophageal reflux.	3.0035814878002016
Disorders of the esophageal phase of deglutition can produce retrosternal pain, heartburn, regurgitation and vomiting, as well as laryngeal and respiratory signs.	3.446796163343469
Esophageal motility disorders include lower achalasia, tumors, peptic strictures, inflammatory diseases, drug-induced ulcers, rings and webs.	3.0566343144225248
Motility disorders present with aperistaltic, spontaneous contractions, diffuse esophagospasm, or a hypermotile esophagus.	3.1377489111510077
Gastroesophageal reflux with esophagitis must always be excluded, especially in patients with a globus sensation.	4.316761180636484
The multiple features of the appearance of the symptoms of dysphagia and globus makes multidisciplinary approach necessary in order to establish a diagnosis and begin effective treatment.	3.7476871680207813
Different pest arthropods and dermatophytes occurring primarily in farm animals may be transmissible to man and produce human dermatoses.	2.6918896038345053
The movement and cutaneous penetration habits of external parasites often cause crusted papules, severe itching and dermatitis or may damage their hosts by blood-sucking or by sensitizing them to their saliva.	2.750525213628631
Furthermore different dermatophytes should be considered a possible cause of human skin lesions.	4.0207616477503105
Farm animals (cattle, pig, poultry, and rabbit) can transmit external parasites (ticks: Ixodes ricinus, Argas reflexus; fleas: Ceratophyllus gallinae, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, and mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var.	2.3524667890184823
bovis, Sarcoptes scabiei var.	2.9544430630920693
suis, Dermanyssus gallinae, Cheyletiella parasitovorax), and dermatophytes (Trichophyton sp., and Microsporum sp.).	3.248091347742439
People who have close contact to infested farm animals are more often exposed to epizoonotic infections.	2.932831818751411
Certain professions, such as farmers, and veterinarians, are especially vulnerable.	3.618438351689943
Between 1992 and 1994 two multicentre studies were performed in order to determine the frequency of sensitization to gold salts.	4.227206914757971
In the first study (1992-1993), 872 patients were tested with gold sodium thiosulfate (NTS) 0.25% in Vaseline (V), 0.5% V. and with potassium dicyanoaurate (KDC) 0.002% aqueous solution.	2.8103832068040813
44 patients (5.1%) had a positive patch test reaction to gold salts: 40 (4.6%) to NTS 0.5% V., 20 (2.3%) to NTS 0.25% V. and 5 (0.6%) to KDC.	3.278816816597476
Immunologial complications frequently occur during the clinical course in patients with multiple injuries.	4.937507610335315
The increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators during the immunological response to trauma may lead to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and furthermore, to multisystem organ failure (MOF), which is associated with a mortality of up to 80%.	3.686184985255332
The development of multiple organ failure following major trauma is associated with remote organ failure, the dysfunction of organs which were not initially affected by the traum.	3.4672740707780507
In particular, the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the development or SIRS, MOF and ROF is discussed.	3.406956253742363
A report on two cases with benign tumors of the atrioventricular node (so-called mesothelioma of the av-node or endodermal inclusions of the heart).	3.6912511418640057
In one of the cases the tumor could be the cause of the known electrophysiological disturbance of the conduction system (av-block) and of the sudden and unexpected death.	4.396621493710603
A case of delayed death after a low-voltage accident is presented.	3.0947591915256294
At first, an obvious source of electricity was not found.	3.16770781216255
However, electric marks were found on the fingers.	3.305129363207529
The identification of the conductor was performed by analysis of the metallisation of the electric marks.	3.65226221970542
The location of the probable conductors in a boiler under the hand basin and the discovery in a standing position prior to collapse in a bathtub indicates that the capability to act was preserved for a short time period.	2.7804332985749274
In such rare cases death seems to be a result of cardiac arrhythmia resulting in ventricular fibrillation.	3.7629852607245513
A 53-year-old man presented a melanotic lung tumor which was based in the bronchus of the left lower lobe and closed the left main bronchus.	3.488222560235226
After laser therapy, left lobectomy with sleeve resection was carried out.	3.065562433105901
Complications after the surgery required resection of the rest of the left lung and thoracoplasty.	4.2162257382685855
Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma.	3.1095624434094327
There was no past history of an excision or a fulguration of a cutaneous, mucous membrane, or ocular lesion.	2.85340261063028
Examination of the skin and the eyes did not yield any evidence of another primary tumor.	3.32214701159038
We conclude that the lesion represents a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, a rare neoplasm of which only 21 cases have been confirmed.	3.781433276659276
The patient does not have any evidence of tumor in the relatively short follow-up period of 10 months.	3.8365634065492547
Background: To find out the incidence of spontaneous pubertal development in girls with Turner syndrome we investigated patients with a bone age of at least eleven years.	3.9180556450896136
Results: 6 out of 17 patients showed spontaneous puberty.	3.5087649236488474
There exists no clear correlation between karyotype and phenotype on the one hand and incidence of spontaneous puberty on the other.	3.309240119305485
Basal as well as stimulated gonadotropin levels in the late childhood could better indicate spontaneous puberty in Turner syndrome.	3.538942373502877
Conclusion: In contrast to the generally held opinion spontaneous pubertal development is not rare in girls with Turner syndrome.	3.0283742306504418
Therefore estrogen replacement therapy should be started only after it became certain that there will be no spontaneous puberty.	3.240099265162477
From January 1992 until April 1995, 31 patients with trans- and suprasphincteric anal fistulae (transsphincteric n = 21; suprasphincteric n = 4; transsphincteric in Crohn's disease n = 6) underwent a fistulectomy followed by closure of the internal opening by suture and anocutaneous flap.	3.0023453221861898
All patients had undergone previous operations, some several times.	3.019698017180226
The recurrence rate of 13 % appeared to be low after a short follow-up.	3.5093801812623746
Continence was only negligibly impaired, although the anal resting pressure and contraction pressure were significantly reduced.	3.1515538039685924
In five patients a shortened prewarning period was noticed.	3.027982183537101
Also in Crohn's fistulae the results were equivalent when the surgical treatment was performed in a non-inflammatory period.	4.335976907612019
Staging of malignant tumours of the oral cavity and the oropharynx not only requires far more than a basic knowledge of anatomy and the usual pathways of spread, but also a broad understanding of the diagnostic benefits of current imaging modalities.	3.772415989562957
As radiology should never try to replace histology, the main aim should be precise prediction of tumour margins and differention of tumour from edema and posttherapeutic changes.	3.041954902686827
Only then will imaging studies have a significant clinical impact.	3.4494491825018003
Post-traumatic recurrent dislocation is a major problem in the operative treatment of shoulder dysfunction in young athletes.	3.6177438561315527
This prospectively designed study evaluates the long-term results of a modified Eden-Hybinette procedure in young male athletes.	3.4710777532961217
The criteria were: capacity in sports, functional limit, and persistent pain.	3.066323374255889
Genuine disorders of the glenoid or muscular imbalance of the shoulder joint were criteria for exclusion.	3.936834940244883
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disorder which primarily affected the myocardium.	3.39407863211219
It is characterized by a hypertrophic left ventricle that shows normal systolic function but impaired diastolic relaxation.	2.7366085909846327
The most important complication of HCM, sudden cardiac death, is mainly responsible for a mortality of approximately 3.5% in childhood.	3.10188978896917
While most patients remain asymptomatic for years, there are some reports about patients progressing from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to a dilative form within years.	3.4552191082378827
A prospective study was performed on 72 patients with osteochondritis dissecans (OD) of the knee and ankle to compare plane radiography, MRI and arthroscopy before therapeutic procedures.	3.419742871472099
Special interest was placed on the assessment of fragment stability with radiological methods for staging related therapy.	3.410208884476699
Using conventional radiography, OD of the condyles was staged according to the classification of Rodegerdts and Gleissner and OD of the talus suggested by Berndt and Harty.	3.3315615158604093
MRI staging was performed by morphology of the interface of the OD.	3.901191278629528
Arthroscopical staging based on the classification of Guhl.	4.743556313000782
There was an excellent correlation between the stages in MRI and arthroscopy, showing correct prediction of stable and unstable fragments in 92%.	3.226125449235521
In contrast, fragment stability could not be efficiently assessed by conventional radiology because fragments could be stably fixed in cases of bony separation.	3.3287986251523476
MRI is indicated before performance of staging-related therapy of OD to select patients with stable fragments for conservative therapy and those with unstable OD for surgical therapy.	3.221284140669617
A case of rupture of the right hemidiaphragm resulting from blunt trauma with complete intrathoracic dislocation of the right hepatic lobe in a multiple trauma patient is presented.	4.1133970817338055
After a primary chest X-ray study had been interpreted as showing right-sided hemothorax, the thoracic drainage tube was accidentally placed into the liver.	3.2489088563667607
CT revealed a diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture with intrathoracic liver dislocation.	3.357403040075209
The liver was replaced and the extended dorsal diaphragmatic rupture was closed primarily via an abdominal approach.	3.098922232786013
Problems of diagnosis and operative procedure in rare cases of fresh right-sided blunt traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures are discussed.	3.662739408029468
