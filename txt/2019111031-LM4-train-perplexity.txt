Although there are a few isolated reports in the literature suggesting that sugar beet pollen is highly antigenic, hypersensitivity to components of sugar beet is not a common disease.	2.0842389750079278
We report a 29-year-old man with a history of atopic dermatitis who developed both contact dermatitis and allergic rhinitis from sugar beet pollen through his job in a seed nursery.	2.0164571437321257
Establishing nursing science at German universities has become more and more consolidated.	2.3630680346993453
At the beginning of this establishment there was an evident backlog especially compared to angloamerican and scandinavian countries.	1.9925370811052254
Today - 1997 - more than 40 nursing science courses exist at German high schools and universities.	1.8776043329573662
Active glucocorticoids (GCS), such as cortisol or corticosterone, are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung.	2.3393578426898536
In fetal serum, biologically inactive metabolites (cortisone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone) outweigh the active forms.	1.822090799137969
In this study we demonstrate with organoid cultures of fetal rat lungs that the reductive side of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) regulates the intracellular activation of GCS.	1.756774010453951
The inhibition of 11-HSD by the licorice extract glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibits this central metabolism.	1.9513524823190764
In a community sample of 394 eldery aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed.	1.8765649045044108
Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed.	2.211123228967673
The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person.	2.3800001584006627
In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time.	2.1920555369883123
88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year.	2.148572540704995
The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine.	2.3057810439845627
Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor.	1.9485208963048006
Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life.	2.0239442505766583
Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support.	2.3296880831586573
There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine.	2.315601428702779
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) are chronic inflammatory and frequently relapsing diseases of the gut that ultimately lead to destruction of the intestinal tissue.	2.0612538623255756
Recent evidence suggests that a pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of IBD.	2.3668442593937717
Furthermore, changes in cell migration and cytokine production appear to contribute to the perpetuation of IBD and the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.	2.110771881479621
Based on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD, several new therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical practice, including recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-, IL-10, IL-11) and inhibitors of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM), proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-12) and their receptors (TNF, IL-6R).	2.248851014039432
Dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	2.420052961508447
A defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response.	2.0574419628582152
Experimental findings in apoptotic keratinocytes and C1q knock-out mice suggest an important role of C1q in the clearance of apoptotic cell material.	2.091385281441327
In addition, there are several links between C1q and SLE: Most the patients with C1q deficiency develop a SLE-like syndrome.	2.08287262494366
SLE itself often causes secondary C1q deficiency and autoantibodies to C1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis.	2.2074032275614957
These observations suggest a central role of C1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of SLE.	2.693469017770717
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the causes and accident mechanisms that lead to injuries in infancy involving buggies and prams in order to establish strategies for accident prevention.	2.0719440826929425
The discussion about the implementation of telemedicine and teleresourcing and its consequences has been under way for some time now.	2.0054227851449666
There is a need for integration of all the existing fragments into one coherent telemedical concept.	2.085728911044747
Different aspects of telemedical concepts are discussed.	2.2993755177941524
A 34-year-old woman who was separated from her husband, was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest.	1.8745790349621432
The post-mortem examination was carried out approximately 5 h after death.	2.447474648319404
At the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken.	1.9731605412293771
Additionally, a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her polo-neck pullover.	1.990939545806356
It was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a fabric pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim.	2.1903939959631864
DNA typing (short tandem repeat-PCR) of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect.	2.282124231327347
A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of self-reinforced absorbable composites (Biofix) in the fixation of ankle fractures.	2.8645167151603266
The aim of this study was to demonstrate that fixation with Biofix rods and screws is as good as the standard A. O. fixation.	1.8770666288698827
Patients aged between 16 and 75 years old with closed, non-comminuted fractures of the lateral and/or medial malleolus and dislocation of the fracture fragments greater thean 2 mm were included in the study.	2.5115579598257516
22 patients were treated with Biofix rods and screws and the control group of 19 patients with a standard technique.	3.2124910927371664
After 3, 6 and 12 months, rontgenograms were taken.	2.661991376362808
At the same time functional results were evaluated following the criteria of Olerud and Molander.	2.338059346809598
Two patients were withdrawn from the trial for non-medical reasons.	2.4185295603325248
22 patients (12 from the Biofix group, 10 from the AO group) operated two or more years ago were contacted to see if any complications had occured since they were last seen.	1.8328476542116818
In 4 cases a Biofix screw broke down just beneath the head during insertion.	1.9284062291213555
This did not result in an insufficient fixation of the fracture.	2.884016381448559
There were no early post-operative complications.	2.4993165305484
The functional and rontgenological results in both groups were equal.	2.5873790503668648
In three cases a sterile sinus developed at the site of screw insertion.	2.2381669082119924
Biofix rods and screws, made of polylactic acid, are a good alternative for the fixation of fractures of the ankle.	2.77501754288194
The use of resorbable fracture fixation material has the advantage that a second operation to remove osteosynthesis material is not necessary.	2.0114989431031707
The long term results are good.	2.8427086714919345
There is, however, a possibility of development of tissue reaction to the resorbable material.	2.5668680327909525
In current textbooks of dermatology, lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular, intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology.	2.106089822087932
When this concept was developed, there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid.	2.5339985793628013
It is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins, as it is in systemic amyloidoses, but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes.	1.86890713750424
Even several years ago, chronic scratching was invoked as a possible cause of damage to keratinocytes in lichen amyloidosus.	2.1457189401505703
In support of this hypothesis, four cases are presented.	2.4555500300363806
Apart from amyloid in the papillary layer, all biopsy specimens revealed histopathological signs of chronic scratching (epithelial hyperplasia with hypergranulosis and compact orthokeratosis, coarse collagen in vertical streaks in the stratum papillare), such as are also found in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus.	1.7377482054190758
Lichen amyloidosus is considered to be a variant of these conditions.	2.8970905324181704
Just as in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus, pruritus seems to be the cause and not a symptom of the papular skin lesions.	2.086356029623337
Consequently, treatment of lichen amyloidosus should not be directed at removing amyloid, but at improving the pruritus.	2.1757318368765306
Ulcers in chronic venous insufficiency, especially in postthrombotic syndrome, are often resistant to compression therapy.	2.5192377691243677
They can be treated effectively by the dermatologic surgeon with a fairly simple operative procedure.	2.1611232660822917
The removal of the ulcer together with the extensive lipodermatosclerosis by Humby knife (shave-therapy) and immediate grafting with a meshed split skin graft - possibly in combination with ligation of insufficient perforator veins - yields very good success rates.	1.919900508243478
The results in 13 patients (18 legs) with an average follow up period of 11 months (up to 20 months) are reported.	2.7626856558606123
The literature from 1990-1997 and 3 personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites.	1.9788006480522509
Bites of the adder (Vipera berus) are rare.	2.2047231536656064
Symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution, death due to adder bite is rare.	1.9812806302211854
The main venom effect is the development of - sometimes severe - edema, hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy, very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure.	2.008562178243591
Significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2-3 h after the incident, no signs of intoxication can be found.	2.2268352021599784
Background: The use of high-tech communication is undoubtedly growing and has become established in almost all sciences and research fields.	2.1753540837441854
This article surveys the possibilities for scientific data-exchange via the Internet, the world's largest computer network.	1.900199312685869
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are known to exhibit far less cardiac side effects than tricyclic antidepressants.	2.086286806441625
We report three cases in which the SSRI, paroxetine, induced clinically relevant ECG changes in patients with high risk profile.	2.3819200205528923
In two cases an increase in QTc time was observed, severe bradycardia was also observed twice.	2.3673024566338174
Objective: Cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is not very helpful in the management of patients with whooping cough, since culture takes three to five days until results are available, and only about 30-60% of patients may be detected by this method.	2.286217995097783
In order to improve the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough, different protocols for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed.	2.003244154474202
With the introduction of each new technique for registering eye movements, the question arises concerning whether these provide a reliable and accurate alternative for the  diagnosis of labyrinthine dysfunction when compared to the most commonly used electro-oculographic technique.	2.329581261372772
To answer this question we compared mean slow-phase velocity (SPV) using three different recording techniques: electro-oculography (EOG), video-oculography (VOG) and infra-red oculography (IROG) during four different types of examinations.	1.7392724472883336
The examinations were the eye target tracking test (ETT), horizontal and vertical optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) tests and the rotating chair test of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR).	1.7018151716341916
For the ETT tests the VOG provided consistently higher mean SPV values with low variance, presumably because of the accuracy and stability of the calibration.	2.1266258198935395
For the horizontal OKN and VOR rotating chair tests no significant differences were found between the mean SPV obtained with the different recording techniques, although the IROG recordings were associated with a larger variance.	2.3262508934113417
Vertical OKN mean SPV was consistently lower with IROG and VOG techniques presumably because of non-linearities and resolution limitations inherent in these techniques.	1.965976574566491
These results indicate that the EOG technique despite its disadvantages of noise, time to apply and variability of calibration still provides an inexpensive, reliable and accurate means of measuring slow-phase eye movements.	1.9101768907339403
Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of the circulating adhesion molecules sICAM-1 and sE-selectin could serve as early predictors of developing sepsis and its severity.	2.0032279553441596
Problem: The data model given in the  DICOM standard is examined unter the aspect of system integration.	1.9712296821449224
Semantic properties of the IODs (information object definitions) and their relationships are investigated.	2.3067182614098543
Thoracic disc herniation is rare.	2.499916703203846
Pain is the most common initial symptom, followed by sensory disturbances and motor involvement.	2.681674927631273
By the time of diagnosis, 90% of the patient have signs of spinal cord compression.	2.9539618092115956
A 42-year-old woman was operated on because of shoulder pain.	2.5154299994605704
During her stay in hospital, the patient first demonstrated uncharacteristic pain and after 2weeks an incomplete paraplegia caused by herniation of the T10/11 disc.	2.0227931514924453
Degenerative changes have been considered to be a cause for spontaneous quadriceps tendon rupture.	2.62887617742745
Aim of this study is to investigate the microvasculature of the quadriceps tendon by injection techniques and immunohistochemical methods (antibodies against laminin) with regard to the pathogenesis of tendon degeneration.	2.5397622688779307
The blood supply of the quadriceps tendon arises from descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, by branches of the descending geniculate artery and by branches of the medial and lateral superior geniculate arteries.	2.176372603525125
Blood vessels penetrate the tendon from the surrounding connective tissue and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	1.9088058726914363
Compared to the surrounding synovial layer, the amount of vessels in the tendon substance is greatly reduced.	2.1873818275423154
The distribution of blood vessels within the quadriceps tendon is not homogenous.	2.3389724505389986
The anterior or superficial part of the tendon has a complete vascular network that extends from the musculo-tendinous junction to the patella.	2.104954968480035
Within the deep portion of the quadriceps tendon there is an oval shaped avascular area which measures app.	2.1611432377574364
30 mm in length and app.	2.540941347018457
Within this area the immunohistochemical proof of laminin is negative.	2.1274597218225546
An explanation for the absence of blood vessels may be compressive stress caused by the patellar groove which serves as hypomochlion for the quadriceps tendon when the knee is flexed.	2.2397657079541338
When looking for the possible cause of distortions in values measured for the determination of breath ethanol concentration (BEC) in artificially respirated patients, consideration must be given to the humidity and temperature of the gas examined.	1.949390253907113
In the present study, the effects of humidified and warmed and of dry and cold air on the accuracy of a newly developed BEC measuring device, as compared to a reference model and to a conventional system, were examined in a lung model.	2.21240919844332
Total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following Le Fort I osteotomy in CLP patients are frequent and major complications.	1.9484168098045211
The aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement.	2.161163848657265
Maxillary distraction was performed in 12 patients.	3.1637628428723272
In two cases, a Delaire mask was used to bring the maxilla forward, ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by Polley.	2.247156043587873
In all patients, planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved; one partial relapse occurred.	2.2001474013960203
The results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability.	2.330825600857118
The technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure.	2.1639934689812903
We report a rare case of primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult.	2.24551650396073
A huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62-year-old man.	2.1210982627090766
The patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until 4 days before admission to hospital.	1.9687791701537485
Histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round-cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered Homer-Wright rosettes.	1.8557826335488974
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with O13, a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein p30/32MIC2.	1.8743243241220275
Focally, tumour cells stained positively for vimentin, NSE, S-100 protein and synaptophysin.	2.0541847889937905
The patient died 3 weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge, partly exophytic but mainly endophytic tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue.	1.9349351047321461
The differential diagnosis of small round-cell tumours in this location is discussed.	2.391993844573249
Lesions of the acetabular labrum should be treated by correcting the causes.	2.5999898022229493
In a steep acetabulum where the femoral head brings the acetabular labrum under tension and traction, the acetabulum should be rotated by triple pelvic osteotomy to slightly overcorrected acetabular measurements.	1.8404420579636476
Severely diminished acetabular and femoral anteversion can also lead to tears and impingement of the labrum.	2.056184619603332
Then rotation of the femoral neck and/or rotations of the acetabulum by triple osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion are indicated.	2.501009275759131
Our triple osteotomy technique differs from that of others mainly in the ischial osteotomy.	2.1769519311941825
It is performed from the posterior approach between the sciatic notch next to the ischial spine and the obturator foramen and is directed 20-30  ° anteriorly from the frontal (coronal) plane.	1.8998191042360582
Our normal values of the acetabular position were tested by correlating the measurements with the absence of pain.	2.3987715193748076
The optimum is reached with a CE angle and a VCA angle of 30-35  °, an angle of the weight-bearing zone of +5 to -5  ° and a migration index of 10-15 %.	1.9929047587264128
Overcorrections again caused pain and should be avoided.	2.7106587819332044
Diminished anteversion of femur and acetabulum towards 0  ° also caused pain and should be corrected by triple and femoral osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion.	1.9686146224029581
In earlier follow-ups of 216 hips 5-10 years postoperatively, 82.3 % of the joints showed no change in the degree of osteoarthrosis.	2.340340412709211
Survival rate curves regarding the absence of pain demonstrated that pain was experienced again when joints were corrected insufficiently or overcorrected, while in good corrections the joints were free of pain in about 75 %.	2.0198515423698593
Background: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is associated with point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that appear to be pathogenic for this disease.	2.1284042812508726
These mutations affect nucleotide positions 3460, 11 778 and 14 484.	1.9916358074547162
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) is an immunoglobulin-mediated, drug-induced side effect for heparin-treated patients with thromboembolic complications.	2.3015090397527183
With an incidence of 1-3 %, mortality of 20 % it and permanent disability for another 20 % is a clinically relevant disorder.	2.2647726519810685
With heparin treatment or prophylaxis frequent platelet count monitoring is necessary.	2.1269953792150487
With HIT type II the thrombocytopenia is often a harbinger of thromboembolic complications in the venous or arterial system.	2.131988704372901
If HIT type II is suspected, further heparin exposure is to be stopped immediately and another anticoagulant therapy should be started.	2.3934934429643238
The two anticoagulant options in Germany are discussed.	2.361322050133739
At the same time the diagnosis should be confirmed by laboratory testing, including testing for cross-reactivity with danaparoid.	2.1415660625239923
Further therapy depends on the symptoms.	2.9575878629035364
In the case of clinical relevance of this disorder we should think about prophylaxis: strict indications for perioperative prophylaxis only use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for routine prophylaxis, use of LMWH for thrombosis treatment and early change to cumarine.	1.9170450986725067
A patented low-temperature polymerization method for methylmethacrylate (MMA) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described: it has been developed from our previous MMA technique and is a patented procedure.	1.9690969988852745
Differences from the previous method are (1) removal of stabilizer from the MMA monomer before its application, (2) the use of a different starter, (3) avoidance of O2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with N2, and (4) polymerisation in a water bath to draw off residual heat.	2.196452455804828
After this procedure, all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate.	2.195867943625001
The effects of different fixatives are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis.	2.1230635927181902
The advantages over the latter method are: (1) the cells can be better differentiated because semi-thin sections can be made; (2) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semi-thin sections, which means they can be interpreted more easily; (3) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections; (4) osteological examination of bone trabeculae, especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies, is possible; (5) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved.	2.1646773497218317
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below DM 100,000 including an excellent microtome.	2.0184699249251246
The routine use of succinylcholine for endotracheal intubation is being increasingly questioned.	2.3474254395457717
Initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions.	2.1492636468293975
However, most of these initial studies either did not have a double-blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants.	2.325415703007564
In this study, intubation conditions using fentanyl/propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl/propofol/succinylcholine and sodium thiopental/succinylcholine.	1.9386772453028582
Nosocomial pneumonia is still a common problem, especially in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.	2.8909473287900864
The endotracheal tube contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in these patients, because it facilitates microaspiration and impairs host defense.	2.3430044608562905
Common nosocomial pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to produce exopolysaccharides and generate a complex biofilm structure, which allows adhesion to abiotic surfaces and protection against antibiotic action.	1.881765285961947
Multiple studies have identified bacterial biofilm on the inner lumen of endotracheal tubes, which represents a permanent source of infectious material.	1.9328072603247566
Endotracheal tubes, removed from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, are covered more frequently with biofilm than those of uninfected controls.	1.9607590522508114
It remains unclear whether this represents a source of infection or contamination.	2.289435095331971
Bacterial biofilm, however, may play an important role in recurrent pulmonary infections of the intubated and mechanically ventilated patient.	2.3656744802030976
Computer-guided robot-assisted surgery in cementless total hip replacement requires exact preoperative planning at the 3D workstation Orthodoc.	2.089869399633802
Only the Robodoc procedure allows the precise execution of the preoperative plan in surgery.	2.152418301174542
Robot-assisted surgery has been undergoing clinical evaluation at the Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik, Frankfurt, since November 1994.	2.053158830369139
In all 465 patients, the preoperative plan was successfully carried out intraoperatively.	2.4133674491137795
The high precision in reaming, leading to a superb bone implant contact, guarentees absolute initial stability and is likely to promote primary healing between implant and bone.	1.9257369595639813
The common and often published incidence of varus or valgus malpositioning and any fractures or fissures could be avoided through the use of Robodoc.	2.1033026885132218
In this study we describe 22 cases of retrograde ureteral stent placement in pregnant women with therapy-resistant flank pain due to hydronephrosis.	1.8901749706817295
Eight of 22 patients presented symptoms of pyelonephritis.	2.4189575229502998
In 21 cases the hydronephrosis was located on the right and in 4 cases it was bilateral.	2.530112891183889
Maximal lower calix diameter was 12 mm (range 9-22 mm).	2.081262585876453
With the exception of two cases, sonographically controlled stent placement was performed under local anesthesia without sedation.	2.105731204184735
All patients were painfree within 6 days and were given prophylactic low dosis of antibiotic until the day of delivery.	1.988076146394707
Renal function remained within the normal limits.	2.457826757729298
Double-J stent displacement occured in 3 patients - of which one underwent nephrostomy.	2.188639581159094
Postnatal examination demonstrated urolithiasis in 4 of 19 patients.	2.4885039727029734
This study provides evidence for effectiveness of retrograde ureteral Double-J stent placement as a therapeutic option in cases of severe symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy with a low morbidity rate.	2.1185754597288238
Between 1981 and 1994 at the Bergmannsheil Ruhr University Hospital in Bochum, Germany, we treated 145 patients with femoral diaphyseal nonunions following initial operative treatment.	2.11576406360727
Of these patients, 138 received this initial operative treatment at an outside institution.	2.1907480129588364
The primary reconstructions for the fractures utilized plates in 112 cases, reamed nails in 24 cases and external fixators in 9 cases.	1.9043512173807957
The average age of the patients was 35 years and the mean time from the initial operative treatment was 2 years.	2.61632846767726
Twenty-seven patients (19 %) presented with a hypertrophic nonunion and 118 (81 %) with an atrophic nonunion.	2.2413034466305954
There was a significant correlation between primary "classic" plating and development of an atrophic nonunion (2-test: P < 0.01).	2.324177656218996
We observed 34 wound infections (23 %) with no significant correlation to the type of primary osteosynthesis.	2.51261925115812
We determined that 73 of the pseudarthroses were due to improper osteosynthesis techniques.	2.096139464053028
Of these cases, 41 % involved the use of plates, 83 % involved the use of reamed nails, and 78 % involved the use of external fixators.	2.541502887890564
Fracture location near the diaphyseal-metaphyseal junctions was common in this problematic group.	1.9683755006139805
Ninety-two percent of all plates led to atrophic nonunions.	2.1495465927081545
There were 21 open fractures and of these 90 % (n = 19) developed an atrophic pseudarthrosis and 29 % (n = 6) developed a wound infection.	1.9845516165573136
Fifty-seven (39 %) of all patients had additional injuries, but we found that did not increase the risk of disturbed bone healing.	2.446305651124867
Our revision operations focused on the elimination of wound infections, refreshment of bone healing, and improvement in fragment stability.	2.1582242300545142
Only 28 % of all "classic" plates and 11 % of all external fixators were changed to an intramedullary implant at the time of the first revision surgery.	2.1698230240711327
Hypertrophic nonunions required a mean of 1.3 revision operations to achieve bone healing whereas a mean of 2 revision operations were necessary to fuse atrophic bone ends (P < 0.05).	1.9518964583087597
In cases of diaphyseal pseudarthrosis healing time was not affected by the type of osteosynthesis used for primary reconstructions.	2.198507802829358
Since lack of fracture healing can often already be observed directly from postoperative X-rays, we recommend that revision procedures be performed early.	2.166716625126569
The prolonged length of time to care for femoral nonunions underlines the importance of appropriate primary fracture treatment.	2.1431227510791317
That takes into consideration both the biomechanical and the biological aspects of bone healing.	2.289750141258219
Background: In a prospective trial (October 1996 - April 1998) the effect of octreotide and tamoxifen on the recurrence of pancreatic carcinoma after R0 resection was evaluated.	2.2479280474492507
Methods: Patients with a local recurrence after curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with 100 µg of octreotide three times a day and tamoxifen 20 mg once daily.	2.233614798400493
The median survival time, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-30) and side effects of the octreotide-tamoxifen group were compared with a historic cohort (n = 14) of patients treated in our department (9/95-9/96) according to the "best supportive care" concept.	2.334353954759735
Results: Recurrences were diagnosed after R0 resection in a mean time of 13  +/-  6.8 months.	2.2877541444545213
Patients treated with octreotide and tamoxifen had a significantly (P < 0.05) longer median survival time (7 months; range: 3-12) vs 3.5 months; range: 1.5-5).	2.2771336677002143
The octreotide-tamoxifen group suffered less from lack of appetite, nausea, fatigue, and pain and needed fewer analgesies.	1.9363244161119304
The only side effect of the octreotide-tamoxifen therapy was moderate diarrhoe in 2 patients at the beginning of the therapy.	2.4492192504872006
Conclusion: Since combined therapy with octreotide and tamoxifen can be administered comfortably for outpatient treatment, this seems to represent progress in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer.	2.0540177449346517
Objective: To study the influence of dopexamine on pulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during major thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV).	2.0717815062389824
Design: Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study.	2.4284325095811807
Patients: Twenty adult patients undergoing elective pulmonary resection.	2.366475441016677
Anaesthesia: General anaesthesia was performed using propofol, fentanyl, N2O and vecuronium.Volume-controlled ventilation was performed to maintain normocapnia over the whole investigation period.	2.1557354769378048
During OLV, the tidal volume was reduced and the respiratory rate was increased to avoid a peak airway pressure exceeding 40 cm H2O.	2.009052614389849
Furthermore the FiO2 was increased to 1,0 and the external PEEP was removed during OLV.	2.2521676154035632
Interventions: The patients received either dopexamine at 2 µg/kg/min (group A, n=10) or 0,9% saline as control (group B, n=10) after assessing the baseline values.	2.3029282428686764
Measurement and results: The following cardiorespiratory variables were recorded: Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure.	2.0979461359771068
Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index, pulmonary vascular resistance index, oxygen delivery index (DO2I), oxygen consumption index and the venous admixture were calculated using standard formula.	1.9595850567404915
Furthermore, pressure-flow-curves were constructed to analyse flow independent changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance.	2.3207843696676442
Data were recorded at the following times: After induction of anaesthesia in stable haemodynamics during two-lung ventilation (baseline values, T0), intraoperatively during one-lung ventilation (T1) and postoperatively after re-establishing two-lung ventilation (T2).	1.846803737667161
Patients characteristics, data from the preoperative lung function testing and surgical procedures did not differ significantly between the groups.	2.42095121794578
CI increased in the dopexamine group from 2,5 +/- 1,2 l - min-1 - m-2 (T0) to 3,6 +/- 0,9 l - min-1 - m-2 (T1) and 4,0 +/- 1,3 l - min-1 -  m-2 (T2).	2.2452206619008046
The course of the intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting did not differ between the groups.	2.5224326948666844
Regarding the pressure-flow-curves there was no difference during OLV between the two groups indicating no major blocking effect of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.	2.131232463458933
Conclusion: It is concluded that dopexamine can be used to improve haemodynamics and oxygen delivery during thoracic surgery without increasing venous admixture during one-lung ventilation.	2.1075705581072435
Functional cine MRI of the pelvic floor is a yet another modality in addition to various radiological fluoroscopic techniques.	2.257825598725108
This article describes our own method in view of the recent literatur and provides morphometric reference values.	2.1320418138983
Background: The influence of cyanosis, and cardiac index in children with cyanotic heart disease on their growth velocity.	2.2648233717034834
Therefore since April 1988 regular mandatory examinations have been offered by the regional health office in cooperation with the Department of Dermatology of the Ruhr-University of Bochum.	1.9803000078984219
The study was based on anonymous questionnaires.	2.6266820918958453
78 of the women always used condoms, while 71 thought that condoms prevent STDs.	2.137079963287409
Three women suffered from a STD in the last 12 months.	2.8989175973640346
The majority the women (75 from this 80 prostitutes) did not perceive the examination as discrimination, while 71 felt the examinations were of high quality.	1.94359116899022
These results indicate that regular mandatory examinations should be part of health prevention care of prostitutes and that they are well accepted and tolerated by these women.	1.9605432487855632
Atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery.	2.2499414627569827
As more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases, the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again.	2.2659114214353018
There are some unresolved problems of this complication.	2.3009325401533003
Reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature.	2.505926616072422
Usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient, self-limiting, and benign.	2.487458962692388
Nevertheless, among patients affected by this arrhythmia, morbidity, mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication.	1.9649104041334002
In addition, postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself.	2.2348865282370887
Today, general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future.	2.463553414986217
According to the clinical course, therapy has to consider ventricular rate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control.	2.2789707108562385
Usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time.	2.5929036923409106
Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery has to be respected in order to minimize overall complication rate.	2.833500082656254
The influence of aspirin treatment on haemostasis is still under debate.	2.1205937844180744
There are doubts in emergency operations, especially in transplant patients, concerning dosage and change in medication.	2.256906621949231
Our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in German transplantation centres.	3.0449260409782135
The question of transplant suitability, dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature.	2.3095233596993805
Some 92.11 % of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin.	2.380792034091887
In these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in 34.2 % of the centres.	1.926277385886402
An increased mortality has not been reported.	2.668846163875908
Most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of 100 mg aspirin daily.	2.1682044409069454
Only 7.89 % of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin-treated patients.	2.131128111596087
In elective surgery, however, a preoperative change in medication is recommended, e. g., the heparin instead of aspirin.	2.480144093811914
Full-thickness defects of the thoracic wall following tumor resection, irradiation damage or secondary wound healing in thoracic surgery require early interdisciplinary cooperation to achieve patient-specific treatment modalities.	2.009190848951291
Plastic surgical differential therapy allowing for sufficient soft tissue coverage, stabilisation of the thoracic wall and space filling in intrathoracic cavities, is presented and critically discussed.	1.9632857124479408
Incomplete anaesthesia is a major clinical problem both in single spinal and in single epidural anaesthesia.	2.2241643962386606
The clinical efficacy of epidural anaesthesia with augmentation (aEA) and combined epidural and spinal anesthesia (CSE) for cesarean section was investigated in a prospective randomized study on 45 patients.	2.0120158426373234
This retrospective study presents the results of 41 patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the Staatliche Orthopädische Klinik of the LMU München in the time between 31.10.1979 and 31.10.1994.	2.209553745157338
It could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures, due to their variety, hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a differanciated therapeutic procedure.	2.0442510788579726
Among the operation methods the K-wire stabilisaton with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i.e.	2.1288640624743262
The K-wire without cerclage was used in two cases.	2.602326105592615
Twelfe fractures were treated with AO-plate-osteosynthesis.	2.6817388955252555
Three fractures had to be treated by resection, as they produced two pseudarthrosis and one serious AC-arthrosis during the conservative therapy.	2.290293587287167
92,7% of the subjective results of the 41 checked up patients were good and very good.	2.491323890132275
The clinical follow-up of 36 and the radiological follow-up of 33 patients revealed in 97% a good and very good outcome in the Boenisch-Score.	2.454073966539063
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis are thought to stem from autoimmunological processes.	2.195282391020005
We describe a 14 year old female adolescent, in whom both diseases manifested almost at the same time.	2.3118066609566768
A prospective long-term follow-up study in patients who had had surgical therapy for renal hyperparathyroidism was launched to investigate the results of surgical treatment and to evaluate possible correlations between preoperative laboratory values and the course of the symptoms.	2.686352128731343
From August 1987 to December 1995, 79 patients underwent surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism.	2.4239783446963914
It was the first neck exploration for 72 patients.	2.3197980637364397
Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to a forearm was our preferred procedure (n = 67).	2.062778091692209
The postoperative course of all patients is known.	2.891795182689491
We carried out one to nine reexaminations (median 4) in 74 of 79 patients.	2.041417466015278
The follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 5 years with a median of 18 months.	2.5820828113300456
After the operation transient hypocalcaemia occurred in 84.8 % of patients.	2.12754110898346
Postoperative hypocalcaemia correlated negatively with the preoperative levels of alkaline phosphatase and intact parathyroid hormone.	2.073308402199171
Within the first month after surgery 60 % of the preoperatively affected patients completely recovered from pruritus, whereas the skeletal syndrome took longer to disappear.	2.0144479844038794
One year after surgery 75 % of the patients with pruritus and 79 % of those with skeletal syndrome had became asymptomatic.	2.3848759961650603
After total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation, patients with preoperatively elevated concentrations of alkaline phosphatase ( > 200 U/l) experienced faster relief from joint pain than patients with preoperatively normal concentrations (P = 0.0297).	2.0085438649282685
To date 4.5 % of the patients developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation.	2.483105471215568
Morbidity of surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism is influenced by patients' risk factors.	2.3948043896743223
Postoperative hypocalcaemia correlates negatively with the grade of renal osteopathy at the time of operation.	2.395449483894152
Preoperative concentrations of alkaline phosphatase influence the rapidity of the relief from joint pain.	2.081094029606559
Coronary artery stenosis with need for therapy is rarely seen in childhood.	2.3485448390558448
A 15-year-old girl with hypercholesterinaemia type II a was undergoing lipid aphereses therapy (once or twice a week) since she was 6 years old.	1.9643739616669038
Single stage urthroplasty with an onlay patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease.	2.0947079942585827
Using buccal mucosa, operative time is substantially reduced by using a two-team approach in which one team harvests the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and calibrates the stricture.	1.8783069362266176
Focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed.	2.203844089971075
For patients with long or dense strictures, grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques.	2.124277180062379
Background: As the slit-lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in-vivo examination and documentation of the multi-layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea, e. g. during wound-healing processes, our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (CLSO; Zeiss) into a high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system.	2.0903030661819537
In order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), as well as some in-vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).	2.1635369245269778
From 3 years' experience with nearly 100 transinguinal preperitoneal mesh prosthesis (TIPP) repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia the indication, anesthesia, modification of the technique, and results are reported.	2.043342190815226
After intraoperative classification of the hernia, the TIPP repair is indicated especially in large defects of the posterior wall (L/M III).	2.2363722965948942
The procedure is easily performed under local anesthesia.	2.3547583138521175
During 52 local TIPP repairs, conversion of anesthesia was never necessary.	2.0604016589777014
Important technical details include the requirement for a sufficient size of mesh (10 cm x 15 cm) and a certain caudal and cranial fixation of the prosthesis using at least three interrupted stitches for each.	2.0825716189987244
Apart from an increased number of seromas (12 %) in the early postoperative period, the results of the TIPP are comparable with those obtained after Shouldice repair for recurrent hernia.	2.4611720854085553
The rate of hematomas, infections, and testicular complications range between 1 % and 3 %.	2.219881297576128
If representatives of the law suspect anyone of drug smuggling by internal bodily concealment and refers the person to hospital, the doctor is requested to recover the ingested drug packets by induction of emesis with syrup of ipecacuanha or apomorphin a.	1.7163657362443518
The permission of this induction as a coercive measure is controversial.	2.1132835147538276
The policemen, the public prosecutor or the judge has to decide, whether the induction of emesis is really necessary, the physician has to declare the risks.	2.029034339291271
Especially when there are only a few drug-containers and the person is no professial "body-packer", non-invasive diagnostic ways also can lead the evidence of incorporated drugs.	2.165185041707585
Rupture of the drug containers leads to acute intoxication and the physician must regard the person as his patient, he has to refuse the role as medical expert for the representatives of law.	1.9067244216255599
The deformity in severe spondylolisthesis consists of two components: the parallel anterocaudad slip of the spondylolisthetic vertebra, and its tilt into kyphotic malposition.	1.8077979729841014
The influence of the two components is very different: the anterocaudad slippage has not much impact on the sagittal profile of the spine and is easily compensated for by a slight increase in lumbar lordosis.	2.2513696605365148
The kyphotic deformity has a high impact on trunk imbalance and the sagittal profile.	2.1760528246447537
There are two compensation mechanisms: hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine to its anatomical extremes and - if that is not sufficient - verticalisation of the sacral bone, performed by contracture of the hamstrings and uprighting of the pelvis around the hip joints.	1.8332624629750718
The latter mechanism is followed by functional disadvantages.	2.4972653806021667
Therefore, correction of the kyphosis of L5 may be considered during operative treatment if the lumbosacral kyphosis (angle delta) is less than 85  ° and the sacral inclination less than 35  °.	1.8750580841444482
The diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities includes analysis of the geometry of the whole leg.	2.4704182390598843
The first step in the diagnostic process is a standardized physical examination.	2.337077949623946
It provides valuable background information for an effective radiological diagnosis.	2.3019761378323387
Even with a thorough standardized physical examination it is not possible to define exactly the deformity or decide on an operative procedure.	2.208716584638875
The diagnosis of axis deviations in the frontal plane can be measured on a conventional plain X-ray of the whole leg.	2.2164654942239177
In this view it is very important that the knee joints are in a true a. p. view independent on torsional deformities of the lower legs.	2.192237032704602
Today the gold standard to measure the torsion and length of the lower extremities is the CT scan.	2.410865171122327
However, the multitude of analytical methods for CT measurements described in the literature do not lend themselves readily to comparison; thus, it is difficult to identify a clear method of choice.	2.1390384986416118
Not every CT measurement is better than a physical examination.	2.305978174776155
Evidence of reproducibility and accuracy is a prerequisite for useful interpretation of the results.	2.3690328604162096
Up to this point in the literature there are only reference values for the Ulm CT Method.	2.6625304041399445
One alternative is the MR scan, which avoids radiological risks, but the reproducibility and accuracy of the MRI method are not as good as for the CT method.	2.2142582108056286
Another alternative is ultrasound, where recent advances in the measurement of torsion and length of the lower extremities have proven competitive with or superior to the accuracy of MRI.	2.337128851172667
The three-dimensional determination of the torsion and length of the lower extremities by ultrasound has now assumed a leading role in the non-radiological diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities in children and adolescents.	2.584553614424329
This method furthermore is increasingly being used in preoperative planning of leg deformities in adults.	2.0950812439849584
Purpose: Management of organ-confined RCC is primarily surgical.	2.164774527677812
5-year survival rates of all stages improved from 40 % in the 1950th to 50 % in the 60th, and stagnate at 60 % in recent series.	1.9900184710009348
Paramount use of ultrasound in modern medicine has been claimed to contribute significantly to an earlier detection of RCC thus better amenable for radical operation.	1.8937596648904957
Other factors may have been strategies and general hospital care.	2.3022337025583255
However, it remains unclear whether an extended lymph node dissection as suggested vy Robson in a seminal paper in the 1960th bears any therapeutic value.	1.8972063307024973
Selected patients with minor lower limb injuries and low risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), who required cast immobilizing and did not receive medical thrombosis prophylaxis, were included in a prospective study.	2.1650337655623115
The decision to give not medical thrombosis prophylaxis depended on an concept of individualised prophylaxis for patients at risk for thromboembolism.	2.070773730650384
From March 1994 to March 1996 in 178 outpatients (118 men, 60 women, mean age 25,8 [16-39] years) a clinical examination and a colour-coded duplex sonography were performed after removel of the cast for detection of DVT of the lower limb.	1.9546831845203283
A phlebographie was performed when thrombosis was suspected.	2.31547472407423
Two patients developed a one bundle thrombosis of the calf.	2.430542522225236
Clinical appearance of lung embolism was not observed.	2.526398880143127
These results suggest, that low risk patients with minor injuries of the lower limb and plaster cast immobilisation do not need a medical thrombosis prophylaxis.	2.2655108341164394
For the judgment of the quality of medical services and for the progress of clinical medicine the comparison of data and informations of the diagnostic and therapeutic process is demanded.	2.4880645290929517
Therefore a systematic and concrete system of documentation should be implemented in every clinic, which consists of standard nomenclature, classification, instruments of outcome measure and documentation standards.	1.891110646157177
There are a group of problems and barriers which stand in the way of this goal.	2.2015729068876895
It is useful to build a minimum basis data set which includes core criterias of clinical dokumentation in orthopedic surgery and include this in an information system so that all of these parts are considered and that a central and comparable data pool is offered for patient care, quality management and research.	1.842888960531881
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was first introduced as an entity in the second edition of the WHO's "Histologic Typing of Salivary Gland Tumours" in 1991.	1.901608906134507
This tumor was first described in 1990 by Ellis and Wiskovitch from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).	1.8165387064537162
Basal cell adenocarcinoma accounts for about 2.9% of all salivary gland malignancies.	2.040626695082753
More than 90% of the tumors are situated in the parotid gland.	2.7455657687801147
Intraoral manifestations are known from case reports only.	2.3957123104410414
Tumors of the palate have been mentioned in three cases.	2.3843846575480727
Histologically this tumor can be easily confused with basal cell adenoma and the solid basaloid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma.	1.9654467309982153
The case presented here is a middle-aged white woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.	2.2259709675390154
Therapy consisted of surgical extirpation with three-dimensional safety margins and histologically proven clear resection margins.	2.172052584648841
Knowledge at this point indicates that basal cell adenocarcinoma has a rather high probability of local recurrence (up to 50%) and a mostly lymphogenous metastatic potential for as long as  10 years after removal of the primary tumor.	2.3640411586134107
Ten year survival is around 75%.	2.5068938628056583
Purpose: To study the incidence and shape of subclinical keratoconus with corneal topography in the fellow eye in the case of clinically, slit-lamp biomicroscopically and topographically diagnosed unilateral disease.	1.952921122425973
Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in industrialized countries.	2.8978430179731736
This is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population.	2.6606396266182837
Medical progress with application of conservative, surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases, but markedly increased the medical care costs.	2.0602720559897962
The result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine.	2.43322677816122
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications.	2.15039980430197
In patients with liver disease with portal hypertension, however, the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit bleeding is increased.	2.584290472747352
While the diagnosis is simple, several therapeutic options are available.	2.4195292487899565
In most cases the bleeding comes from stomal varices, that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3% Ethoxyscerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel.	2.0115203831158373
The resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised.	2.208931640190751
If bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered.	2.5490988704863264
Malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source.	2.428387354944178
Objectives: The cardiotoxic properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in-vitro, as well as under in-vivio conditions.	2.316785940197243
A further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies.	2.061911620052626
The aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a ventriculocisternal perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic variabels and their reversability by wash-out with mock-CSF.	1.9554034722847804
In recent years, our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has greatly expanded.	1.9706379773809182
This, in turn, has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain-injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage.	2.274003845772854
The present article focuses on the pathophysiology of TBI and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention.	2.287624641395759
While some of the substances reviewed are presently used in the treatment of TBI, others are under experimental and clinical evaluation at different stages.	2.427311077958166
This study explored characteristic subjective experiences of schizophrenia.	2.1883688699608466
A questionnaire for self-assessment of disturbances in several cognitive and perceptual areas (the Eppendorf Schizophrenia Inventory, or ESI) was constructed and administered to first-episode schizophrenics (SCHe, n=45), negative syndrome schizophrenics (SCHn, n=45), remitted schizophrenics (SCHr, n=24), depressives (DEP, n=43), alcoholics (ALK, n=48), obsessive-compulsive patients (ZWA, n=46), and healthy controls (KON, n=57).	1.7161920666524664
Comparisons between the SCHe, SCHn, DEP, ALK, and ZWA groups and a subsequent factor analysis revealed four schizophrenia-specific dimensions: attention and speech impairment (AS), ideas of reference (IR), auditory uncertainty (AU), and deviant perception (DP).	1.7590209481477241
Further analyses suggested that the AS syndrome may represent a mediating vulnerability factor while IR, AU, and DP probably are reversible episode indicators.	1.8400417707332497
The results may contribute to refinements in the measurement of specific prepsychotic signs, thus facilitating the development of early intervention approaches.	2.389056793155768
Introduction: The conservative treatment of the most severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) can be sometimes frustrating.	2.8205145097865545
Especially with an underlying autoimmunologic disorder, even the application of artificial tears as often as every 5 min may not prevent further damage to the ocular surface.	2.098251021166409
A microvascular transplantation of the autologous submandibular gland (SG) can be performed by a maxillo-facial surgeon as an alternative approach for those cases.	2.2966712774404594
We report 2 years of ophthalmological experience with the results of this procedure.	3.056599538990053
Aims: The predominant cause of death due to oral cancer is the failure to control local tumor due to regional tumor recurrence.	2.2179148634741868
The sequelae of surgical resection and high-dose irradiation cause substantial changes in head and neck anatomy, leading to considerable problems in the early morphological detection of recurrent disease.	2.61551953873053
Therefore, this study evaluates the verification of cancer recurrence by means of its pathologic glucose metabolism.	2.3793867131535986
Materials and methods: We reviewed a total of 50 [18F]-2-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) investigations performed in 44 patients who had undergone surgical resection of oral cancer.	2.266546077144065
In 23 cases, re-staging (group A) was indicated due to suspicion of recurrent or secondary tumor manifestation.	2.038215141074042
In 27 cases, PET served as a screening procedure (group B).	2.1459651573258562
Statistic evaluation included sensitivity, specifity, positive/negative predictive value and accuracy of 18FDG-PET for the detection of tumor manifestation.	2.225571353541988
Results: 18FDG-PET correctly identified 23 of 26 tumor sites (88%) in the re-staging group and 9 of 10 tumor sites (90%) in the screening group.	2.4168651660614455
We encountered a total number of 16 false-positive foci with an increased 18FDG-uptake.	2.460219962764416
In six patients, 18FDG-PET detected tumor recurrence several months before a morphological correlative could be identified.	2.0984621315752974
In 5 of these 6 patients, the PET findings for the latter tumor sites determined the patient's fate.	2.233431899089004
Specificity was 63% for local recurrence, 97% for secondary lymph node involvement and 90% for distant metastasis.	2.022495024415009
Conclusion: According to these data, 18FDG-PET is the most effective diagnostic tool in the follow-up of oral cancer patients to date.	2.6670281380548375
Due to the high prevalence of recurrent disease in the follow-up of oral cancer, either the detection of early recurrence or the identification of additional, incurable tumors may add substantially to a rational therapeutic management.	2.2678238775402515
We therefore recommend 18FDG-PET for screening and re-staging of recurrent oral cancer.	2.0759594910009636
In over 80 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the Nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long-term results.	2.5337993393969955
Dysphagia, inability to belch or vomit as well as the gas bloat syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication.	2.231668258951943
The frequency of these symptoms could be reduced by modification of the original Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication into the so-called "floppy" Nissen fundoplication, a short and loose wrap of mobilized gastric fundus.	2.137232019315861
Failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon.	2.0711939247082705
Here, reoperation with refashioning of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication.	2.1500747798034188
Technical alternatives may selectively be chosen, when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated hiatal hernia, esophageal shortening, or serious esophageal motility disorders.	1.8565513131767724
Such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy, barium swallow, 24-h pH monitoring, and manometry.	1.9171379781165214
Alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs, including the Nissen fundoplication, Collis gastroplasty, and the Belsey Mark IV.	2.4094083725481497
Modifications of the 360  ° Nissen operation are partial fundoplications like the Hill repair and the Toupet dorsal fundoplication.	1.8733746796850754
Because of a high failure rate in the long-term follow-up, application of the ligamentum teres cardiopexy and of the Angelchik prosthesis is not recommended.	2.6925417421180087
We report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) starting in a 5-year-old boy with gait disturbance.	2.123699628455281
At the age of 10 years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms: intention tremor, nystagmus and visual disturbance.	2.040132520745854
The boy also had curly hair.	2.3505420370962464
Sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of microfilaments, which were also found in cytoplasma of Schwann cells, endothelial cells and fibrocytes.	1.9853043450657357
Similar changes were detected in endothelial cells of a muscle biopsy, which additionally displayed neurogenic atrophy and target fibers.	2.072960655370704
Immunohistochemically, desmin, vimentin, heat shock protein 70, and ubiquitin were not detectable in giant axons, which, however, contained neurofilament protein 68, 200 and  -tubulin.	2.024542240873001
Our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of GAN.	2.472074621142544
The endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way.	2.0015169597751
Between 1 October 1994 and 7 May 1995, 46 patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on 55 hands were documented in a prospective study.	2.2399135206756924
The following results were taken from a questionnaire.	2.4253293353214396
There were not any complaints, or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in 51 of 55 cases.	1.9914863885533265
There were continuing complaints in four cases, and after an additional check two patients were operated on again.	2.6612196419534886
The advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative disablement.	2.0985732000189414
For surgical removal of a malignant choroid melanoma, it is necessary to reduce systolic blood pressure to around 50-60 mmHg in order to prevent choroidal haemorrhages.	2.683333846208311
However, blood pressure reduction is associated with the risk of cerebral ischaemia.	3.3056367254228496
We report a patient with a malignant choroid melanoma in whom waves I and II of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) disappeared during surgery under controlled arterial hypotension and hypothermia (31.1 ° C).	1.9235082947295878
The waves could be recorded again immediately after the mean arterial pressure was increased from 48 to 77 mmHg.	2.187465726603391
The oesophageal temperature had dropped by 0.3 ° C at this time.	2.0954670221375458
A bilateral, reversible, apparently blood-pressure-dependent loss of waves I and II during arterial hypotension despite a normal EEG has to our knowledge not been previously described in the literature.	1.9808089639925186
The isolated loss of waves I and II with maintenance of waves III, IV, and V is unusual.	2.0703124969567135
The literature contains reports of acoustic neurinoma patients in whom only wave V could be recorded.	2.1329020812819732
This is regarded as an indication of continued impulse conduction despite the loss of waves I to IV.	2.348690139963419
Others have observed a patient with temporary and reversible loss of BAEP wave I due to vasospasm of the internal auditory artery that apparently occurred during or shortly after manipulation of the internal auditory meatus.	2.0166869160403653
Assuming anatomic peculiarities in the blood supply to the generators of the BAEP waves, a stenosis of the basilar artery could be considered as the cause of the bilateral reversible loss of waves I and II.	2.1473568946917134
Another potential source could be the induced hypothermia, but this does not seem very likely because the patient's temperature was 0.3 ° C lower at the return of the waves than at their loss.	2.0365000439941308
In the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy, little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias.	2.3258666117171782
In a group of 54 patients with documented ventricular tachycardia during longterm ECG recordings, the determinants for the development of VT and the relationship between signal-averaged ECG and the morphological characteristics of the disease are investigated.	2.413616839925965
The analysis of the long-term electrocardiographic data includes the measurement of RR-intervals 30, 15, 5, 1min and immediately before onset of the VT, the determination of the morphology of the previous ventricular premature beats, and the frequency of the atrial arrhythmias.	2.595190366889233
Normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ECG signal accquisition with bidirectional filters between 40 and 300Hz were defined a maximum of 113ms for a QRS width, LAS of 38ms, and RMS40 of 16uV.	1.9834833377521996
The analysis of the long-term ECG produced monomorphic VT in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only 4 cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats.	2.3050505132153725
A long-short phenomenon could only be proven in 4VT episodes.	2.278496370147505
In 84% of all tachycardias, no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event.	2.080155668840459
According to the circadian clock, two peaks, mornings between 6 and 9h and evenings between 6 and 9h, could be determined.	1.8727545957854477
In patients, who were recently diagnosed with ARVD, a significant shortening of the RR intervals before the onset of VT as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed.	2.2666738214431814
This effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of AVRD.	3.397720327728329
Late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74% overall.	2.464822794589231
Increasingly, late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the ARVD.	2.3686230680780342
A correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias (ventricular, sustained or not sustained VT) could not be established.	2.337900429272535
In comparison to the origin of VT in coronary heart disease, previous arrhythmias play a less important role in arrhymogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy.	2.2907824936644032
Most importantly, an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of VT and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed.	2.133037278762362
We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient with a Syme amputation of his left leg following diabetic gangrene of the foot.	2.03671837929453
A  local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two  endoscopic debridements and lavage.	2.3139639395795237
Additionally, the patient received local antibiotics by the application of antibiotic collagenous fleece and antibiotic chains.	2.3388315048765693
This therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump.	2.380844191403812
We describe an eighteen-months-old boy, who suffered from congenital vitium cordis, jejunalatresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphies and psychomotor retardation in connection with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.	1.8512521677756784
In most cases the genesis of brachial plexus palsy is traumatic, often because of bike accidents.	2.000843932553455
If physiotherapy and neurosurgical procedures such as nerve repair do not have the desired outcome, muscle transfer operations are possible.	2.1224549028507482
The results of our favored transfer of the trapezius muscle to compensate paralysis of the deltoid muscle will be presented.	2.0784641078972084
Preoperatively radiological, clinical and electromyographic examinations are necessary.	2.4773883944700406
Our results are based upon the clinical and radiological check ups and the subjective assessment of the patients.	2.9576919867460623
Thirty-one patients (7 female, 24 male) underwent a trapezius transfer between March 1994 and December 1996.	2.0213698276907763
With the patient in lateral decubitus position and protection of the opposite plexus, a sagital skin incision is the first step, followed by the preparation of trapezius and deltoid muscle as well as the bony parts of the shoulder (acromion, clavicle, scapular spine).	2.3265898129459175
The deltoid origin is cut from the lateral third of the clavicle, the acromion and the lateral half of the scapular spine.	2.272763501428258
The next step is transection of the root of the acromion and the lateral clavicle.	2.1224364649980254
After elevation of the remaining trapezius insertions from the clavicle and scapular spine, the proximal humerus is exposured by splitting the partly detached deltoid muscle longitudinally.	1.8754360506200483
Then the acromion fragment and humerus are prepared for the bone-to-bone contact.	2.4055135543419977
In 90  ° of abduction the acromion fragment with its trapezius insertion is transferred and fixed to the humerus with two 4.5-mm screws.	1.857401788829987
Finally the deltoid is sutured on the top of the trapezius and the skin is closed over two suction drains.	2.0328316352615814
Postoperatively we immobilize the operated arm in an abduction support for 6 weeks.	2.1457008805498248
The physiotherapy program starts on the first postoperative day with active training of elbow, hand and fingers and electrostimulation of the transferred trapezius muscle.	1.969078927780067
Six weeks after the procedure we take an X-ray and start with progressive adduction of the arm.	2.282862652713718
The preoperative subluxation of the humeral head was abolished in all cases.	2.3513739835231
We achieved an average increase of active abduction from 7.3  ° (range 0-45  °) preoperatively to 39.2  ° (range 25  °-80  °) 1 year after the operation; the increase of forward flexion was from 20  ° (range 0  °-85  °) to 43  ° (range 20  °-90  °).	1.9359476089198864
Finally we can conclude that the trapezius transfer for flail shoulder gives a satisfactory outcome regarding shoulder function and stability as well as the subjective situation of the patients.	2.2520852765044017
We analyzed psychiatric and criminological data from 103 arsonists.	2.137818311083859
The following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to DSM-III-R and IDC-10 seem appropriate.	2.029979879901464
First, the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising, since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives quoted in DSM-III-R may also have an aggressive motive.	1.8951430102489069
Second, ICD-10 gives being drunk and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania.	2.1137281660923835
This seems untenable, since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol misuse.	2.00665877506295
Repeated firesetting, resulting from being fascinated by fire etc., may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a psychoinfantilism, which, supported by alcohol abuse, extends into older age.	1.945801284264552
The tendency for relapses after imprisonment seems to be low; this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age.	2.086287955454185
The mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below 30 years, those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35, deluded arsonists have a mean age of 40 years.	1.995410579598195
Concrete sexual motives are relatively rare.	2.5536713612654456
Retaliation is a rare cause, however, since most of them do not even know the victims.	2.81303631360367
One third of these persons set the fire in their own homes.	2.1104429809627248
Most arsonists show a personality disorder, with insecurity and narcissism predominating.	2.1014483126713634
Data on firesetting are to be treated with caution, since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved; one fourth of cases concern minors, and in Central Europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists.	2.1468928848825604
A normal ciliary beat frequency of ciliated cells is necessary for the mucociliary clearance of the nose and paranasal sinuses.	2.058031962851501
An in vitro investigation was performed to eval-uate the influence of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines on the ciliary beat frequency of human nasal mucosa.	2.1999888011229194
The nasal sprays examined contained the corticosteroids budesonide or fluticasone propionate and the topical antihistamines azelastine or levocabastine.	1.7921586087930346
All tests were performed on cell cultures of human nasal mucosa during constant conditions.	2.251730643901995
Three of the four nasal sprays tested contained benzalkonium chloride as preservative.	2.0397055732775553
An irreversible cessation of ciliary movement was observed in all cells exposed to nasal sprays containing benzalkonium chloride in a 50 per cent solution.	2.044704047991637
The nasal spray containing budesonide was benzalkonium chloride-free and caused minor but fully reversible decreases in ciliary beat frequency after 20 min.	1.8680845606651315
As benzalkonium chloride can cause complete standstill of ciliary beat frequency in vitro in human nasal mucosa, we recommend that this preservative should not be used anymore in topical nasal medications.	2.0064392605366157
The treatment of patients with severe burn injuries is expensive and belongs in the hands of specialized burn centres.	2.240502730045677
In our burn centre 257 patients were treated from 1991 to June 1995 (between 50 and 60 patients per year except for 1993 with 77 patients).	2.026151690156613
Patients were evaluated according to the ABSI score (mean 7) and had mortality of around 15%.	2.330603824553961
The costs range between 3.7 and 4.8 million DM per year, the profit lies in the same range.	2.3111762329494
The costs are divided into staff costs (1.4 - 1.8 million DM per year), costs for medical treatment (1.5 - 1.9 million DM per year) and costs for internal services (600 000 - 900 000 DM per year) such as laboratory examinations (247 000 - 386 000 DM per year) and blood bank (100 000 - 215 000 DM per year), the main factors in this category.	1.8634665366704088
The different fields of costs and profit are compared in this analysis.	2.196178265547505
Possible ways of reducing costs are pointed out, and the question of effectiveness of therapy is discussed.	2.808504146147126
Conclusions from this analysis are limited by the individuality of each case with different clinical courses, the great number of influencing factors and the comparably small numbers of patients.	2.038885218607492
In benign laryngotracheal stenosis the amount of respiratory deterioration rather than the crude morphologic appearance will determine whether or not surgical measures such as dilatation or resection should be applied.	2.1005479835572545
This review focusses on currently available and newly developed diagnostic tools to assess the functional importance of central airway obstruction.	2.126257426100203
After an outline of upper airway physiology is formulated, spirometric measurements at rest are collected.	1.9593531170941405
Among these, Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF) proved to be the simplest and most reliable parameter to monitor an obstructing lesion of the upper airways.	2.152396563913483
A novel technique for fibrobronchoscopic assessment of glottic and tracheal resistance is presented in detail.	2.046446385314817
In contrast to usual tests of total airflow resistance which cannot distinguish between central and peripheral contributions, this test identifies the pressure-flow-relationship created exclusively by the local lesion.	1.7712360443299764
In serial stenoses, it indicates which is of higher clinical impact.	2.193230050546278
Patients with upper airway obstruction complain of impaired exercise capacity.	2.197443228352498
Therefore, spiroergometry may play a role in defining the point of incomplete compensation of a central load.	2.2337687541802227
The decision to operate will depend upon up the degree of physical capacity required to compensate for the stenosis.	2.165056086097598
Stroke units are hospital-based special wards aiming at optimal care by a specialized team with an integrated concept for patients with acute strokes.	2.2337138403830346
Following the initial neurolo-gical and neuroradiological evaluation, early treatment will be initiated based on the assumed pathophysiology of the stroke.	2.102552903640592
Acute management includes monitoring of physiological, parameters, care by specialized nurses, and early implementation of physiotherapists, speech therapy and occupational therapy.	1.864113445015541
Despite the increased initial costs, the long-term burden for the health system is decreased by shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and disability.	2.262437911401565
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the most important side-effect of heparin therapy.	2.6107072275936245
Two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin: a frequent non-immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and, on the other hand, an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications.	1.9110167224470656
Patients and methods: We report on two cases with HIT type II after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).	2.4734040665985746
HIT antibodies were demonstrated by ELISA for platelet-factor-4-heparin-complex and heparin-induced platelet-activation (HIPA) assay.	1.9772448158826799
Results: A 67 year old patient suffered from a HIT type II seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization.	2.3672152327969225
In this patient, a continuous fever and a signicantly reduced general condition were the primary symptoms.	2.1286822762035316
The clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy.	2.322719352819653
Thromboembolic complications did not occur.	2.468610811902885
A 70 year old patient developed a HIT type II with thromboembolic complications 13 days after CABG.	2.452257081704082
The vascular occlusions affected the A. spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior-syndrome, the coronary arteries with the development of myocadial infarction, and the A. iliaca interna.	2.599246699763568
A white-clot syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta, in the left atrium, and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation.	2.6941357145912863
An indication for the development of HIT type II is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy.	2.586735281932228
In the case of HIT type II recombinant hirudin was a practical altenative as an anticoagulant for extracorporal circulation and for continous hemofiltration.	1.9745141099629486
Oxygen radicals and oxygen radial mediators are thought to be important components in the development of acute lung injury, sepsis, and multiple organ failure.	2.5986894551424053
Injured patients, patients with pulmonary diseases, and multiple trauma patients also showed an elevated lipid peroxidation, indicating increased oxidant stress.	2.4181553226476957
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been used as an antioxidant in a wide variety of experiments.	2.5553965688368754
NAC has been suggested to act by raising concentrations of cysteine, and hence glutathione, and by scavenging of oxidant species [1, 11, 17, 29].	2.071666411129998
The present study was designed to investigate whether the application of NAC in intubated patients has an effect on concentrations of reduced glutathione in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and on the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes.	1.9801773946886336
Because NAC has been widely used as a mucolytic drug for the treatment of lung diseases, the influence on tracheobronchial mucus was studied, too.	2.4828499860149917
Between 1990 and 1995, 27 patients with posttraumatic disorders of the subtalar joint were treated by correcting fusion.	2.5454835882619067
Preoperatively 24 patients (88.89 %) suffered from pain; 15 (55.56 %) had a walking range below 100 m. Seven patients were unable to work in their original profession.	1.9346105553340076
After an average period of 13.85 months postoperatively the patients were examined again.	2.469416502672305
At this time 18 (66.67 %) had no or minimal pain; 19 (70.37 %) had no claudication.	1.962870521181699
According to the score of Angus and Skuginna, in 81.48 % of patients the result of the correcting arthrodesis was successful; according to Kitaoka's clinical rating system for ankle-hindfoot, midfoot, hallux and lesser toes, the average postoperative score was 75.8 points.	1.853860085141158
Objective: To examine changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) in children in the last twenty years and to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity.	2.3614046509114925
The review of medication has been recommended as an important part in preventing falls.	2.3918222140332777
In a random sample of 276 hospital in-patients aged 75 and over, the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed.	2.084391278842621
Questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire.	2.3014801697901213
Migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding, whereas dystopia of lower jaw cuspids is described much more often in the literature.	2.1999642432313977
We present a patient in whom radiographic studies show the migration of a mandibular premolar to the muscular process over a period of 14 years.	2.025805862995513
Most of the tooth migration along the vertical portion of the mandibula into the processus muscularis took place after the root development had ended.	1.8399084652264217
Neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth.	2.065868495399584
In atopic eczema patients the well-known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels (white dermographism, delayed blanch after acetylcholine, paradoxical blanching after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection) were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema-free state in comparison with controls.	1.8614463674505048
In this follow-up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema.	2.6233871284844907
Severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema-free cutaneous state.	1.9952955450529606
We report on a 9-year-old girl with a giant cell fibroblastoma of the right anterior chest wall.	2.2887683749777197
This rare soft tissue tumour occurs predominantly in the first two decades of life.	2.4894072219484507
The histology shows a loose infiltrate of predominantly bland spindle cells in dermis and subcutis.	1.9199309556953152
Characteristic elements of the tumour are large angiectoid branching spaces lacking any endo- or epithelium, and relatively small multinucleated cells (floret cells).	1.855789700164153
The recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins.	2.0665210612146176
It is of pre-eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas, in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy.	2.2346625857025417
To correct severe septal deformities, it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage, followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft.	2.171384517288471
The utilization of a compound graft, which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon (PDS) foil, facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum.	1.869901347443747
Stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females.	2.6356290737048576
The usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral.	2.1374647321108293
Two competitive techniques - bladder neck suspension in accordance with Stamey and colposuspension in accordance with Burch - were retrospectively investigated.	2.0820259109103234
A total of 95 women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in 46 and 30 (total 76) patients respectively.	2.243056697550964
Initially, both surgical techniques demonstrated a very good success rate (91.3 % and 96.7 % resp.).	2.0707708217992566
However, the continence rate of the Stamey patients deteriorated after 6 weeks down to 78.3 % and after more than 2 years only 28.6 % of these patients were still completely continent (mean follow-up 40.4 mths), whereas deterioration in the Burch patients was only 87 % (mean follow-up 44.25 mths).	2.1445574631807682
The disappointing results with the Stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence.	2.362693153680886
It was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression.	2.221951388183426
The three cases of recurring incontinence after Burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery.	2.3408381100371423
With respect to long-term follow-up, our results with the Stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the Burch technique.	2.342111818329059
Therefore, in our opinion, the Burch colposuspension procedure and fascioplasty should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence.	2.577643687263474
This paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders, an issue being neglected in German psychiatry for a long time.	2.0029878109056805
Social inequality will be discussed in it's dimensions "socioeconomic status" and "sex" referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge.	2.1065681537255236
Because such macrosocial factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves microsocial concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level.	1.9743350280562038
These concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur.	2.399152929654313
A short review of empirical findings and analytic approaches show the complexity of these mechanisms requiering further research not only because of analytic deficiences but also because of social change.	1.8814376537347175
Further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases, in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure, and last but not least a gender-sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more differenciated.	1.881632874080733
It is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation, although influences on the voice are not assumed.	2.0093452030028613
In addition to the vocal fundamental frequency, vibrations of the vocal chords generate overtones.	2.066551420658547
Through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway, resonances and antiresonances are formed, and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent.	2.271651228236032
Nozzle changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely.	2.2271594854745285
The influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who owned two different dental prostheses.	2.349637022975592
The fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture.	1.8482593908758778
When the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement, a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture.	2.2192113995381573
Sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position.	2.4574498703076433
This change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue, which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture.	2.4216518314777553
In this situation, increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency, shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies.	1.975089347906367
These findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases.	2.1150095606386756
The etiology of this occurrence is still not clear.	2.3620965736933406
Its consequences, however, should be known to the dentist, ENT surgeon and phoniatrist if patients notice changes in their voice after having altered or replaced their dentures.	2.0139061401582543
Cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure, as a function of severity of disease.	2.6513889850200134
The source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research.	2.0081926951754006
Potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation, a neurohumoral dysbalance with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an overspill of cytoines from the failing heart itself.	1.7173746303027515
We present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system, particularly interleukin 6 release.	2.160495635541643
Objectives: This 1998 survey was carried out on the use of the sitting position for neurosurgical procedures in the posterior fossa and operations of the craniospinal and cervical spine region by the dorsal approach.	2.270823989420412
In addition, anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the Neuroanesthesia Study Group of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) published in 1995 were investigated and compared to results of a 1995 survey.	2.035645106594943
Polar body analysis is a perfect tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation.	1.9736993103648834
This helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction, primarily in advanced maternal age patients.	1.8871618731994426
This might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients.	2.5599299390290104
Polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal aberration or a mutation before they become pregnant.	1.8279973467548778
However, it does not assess the genetic status of the embryo resulting from the oocyte tested and selected.	2.1906503620617603
Ethical considerations do not play a role, since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos.	2.193759356580687
Pachydermoperiostosis (Friedreich-Erb-Arnold syndrome, Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome) is a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of unheritance; it occurs almost exclusively in men.	1.9803946535780121
A report of typical pachydermoperiostosis in a 31-year-old man is presented.	2.2921545555968765
Associated features were clubbed digits of the hands and feet with watch-crystal nails, thickening of the skin and soft tissues, hyperhidrosis of hands and feet, hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands with seborrhoea, gynaecomastia, and ophthalmic abnormalities that had been present since puberty.	1.9062817093589857
Radiological examination revealed periosteal hyperostosis of the short and long bones.	2.3038713073223205
Endocrine disturbances were not detected.	2.642345853463574
Skin biopsies showed hypertrophy of the skin and skin appendages.	2.600219878261477
Primary (idiopathic, hereditary) pachydermoperiostosis should be distinguished from secondary (symptomatic) forms of the disease, which are often associated with lung tumours.	2.294297507961194
The following review will examine the outcome of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment studies of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.	2.0779488314202768
For both eating disorders, psychotherapy is the treatment of choice.	2.5069937389339674
In clinical practice "treatment packages" are offered to account for the complexity of the disorders.	2.1871687154458184
In bulimia nervosa, cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques have dominated the literature and appear to be successful.	2.279332668472533
Newer studies reporting on the use of interpersonal therapy also find considerable improvement of symptoms.	2.331590796601235
Antidepressive medication can be useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.	3.0806695675670297
In anorexia nervosa there is a paucity of controlled clinical trials.	2.504797618265477
Contingency management for weight restoration can be viewed as a necessary element in all in- and outpatient treatments.	2.0447103977440384
Family therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and psychodynamic approaches have proven useful in clinical practice; however, only a limited data base exists regarding the efficacy of these therapies.	2.2109646695509726
Medication should not be used routinely in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.	2.968211568550962
Absorption of irrigating fluid in transurethral prostatic resection (TURP) and percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (PNL) into veins or delayed absorption due to fluid extravasation may result in a TURP syndrome.	1.7961873847539764
The measurement of end-tidal breath alcohol concentration (et AC) as a monitor of absorption of irrigating fluid labelled with 2% ethanol is limited by the disturbance of infrared sensors by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Fig.	1.8299409138475822
An electrochemical sensor is acceptable for this method.	2.3346891413660114
The aim of the present study was the evaluation of breath alcohol measurements using an electrochemical sensor device (Alcomed 3010, Envitec).	1.9595538740356846
The stability of the sensor in the presence of volatile anaesthetics was examined using a lung model.	2.4872057865951684
In a clinical investigation, the device was then applied to spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients inhaling volatile anaesthetics during endoscopic urological surgery.	1.9665757735508793
Skin diseases, the psyche and psychological changes are often intertwined, especially in patients presenting for expert dermatologic opinion.	2.3335402071223843
In many cases an additional evaluation provided by psychotherapeutic medicine may be necessary.	2.0982898567762773
This resource may help with the diagnosis, explanation of the problem and estimation of the degree of disability.	2.732716165234384
The role of psychotherapeutic evaluation is demonstrated through case examples.	2.0838353905081966
The evaluation of new possibly occupationally-related disorders such as multiple chemical sensitivity and mobbing is considered.	1.9826340690856825
We investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation.	2.1974662817667374
32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	2.166959168253475
The patients were divided into two groups according to their age.	2.2934544781281607
The result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti-depressant effect of sleep deprivation.	2.006159117532868
During MRI-controlled resection of brain tumors using an open MRI system, operation-induced alterations may occur, especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall.	2.031208820890171
This may simulate tumor areas, resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non-tumorous areas.	2.516343421355425
Based on 42 MRI- and biopsy-controlled brain tumor resections in an 0.5 T open MRI (Signa SP, GE), the appearance and origin of operation-induced reactions are analyzed.	1.9321052131784815
In our opinion, there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation-induced microcontusions.	2.241473973827197
The beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10-15 min.	2.317101330315353
MRI-controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist allows discrimination of operation-induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation.	2.1407545083143753
Angiosarcomas are very rare but highly malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the vascular endothelium.	2.4720762631424695
The tumor is most commonly found in the skin.	2.913318382027038
The cancer is known to cause early and widespread metastases leading to a very poor prognosis of less than 24 months.	2.435797540751574
The therapy of choice is radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation.	2.224811772571864
Background: Lipoprotein (a) is an important codominantly inherited risk factor for coronary disease but there is little data about its distribution in childhood.	2.349319515003699
Despite the important role of lymph node infiltration for the classification and prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), no standards exist to evaluate the quality of mediastinal lymphadenectomy.	2.560377876643359
Researches at several centers are not convinced that complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is necessary.	2.0842809313840087
We investigated 270 consecutive patients undergoing a potential curative operation for NSCLC including complete ipsilateral lymph node dissection in order to ascertain whether or not there is a correlation between tumor localization and lymph node infiltration.	2.386157400471862
Patients were classified into the UICC (1987) stages I (n = 115), II (n = 42), and IIIa (n = 113).	2.2263918014510766
In patients with N1-positive lymph nodes (n = 61) we found higher 5-year survival for patients with only intrapulmonary lymph node infiltration (39 %) than for patients with hilar infiltration (21 %).	2.2603396940936946
Patients with N2 disease showed skip metastases in up to 81 % of cases.	2.2189565754786233
We found that no tumor location predicted the lymph node infiltration.	2.3059715356330517
Due to the variability of lymph node infiltration and the frequently occurring skip metastases, complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy should be the standard for curative operations for NSCLC.	2.106705148642709
The muscles should be viewed as a response member in functional and structural disorders as well as in central control.	2.4234695295929254
This second part of the article will attempt to show not only that the muscles are representing an interesting and sensitive information pool for disorders in the motoric system, but also that lesions in specific leg and hip muscles have an effect on the pelvis and spine and even on scapular mobility.	1.9664697667746263
Purpose: The aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease.	2.3638736801900233
Methods: From February 1996 to February 1998, 16 patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure (ABF) using the transperitoneal approach.	2.0748995972081032
Six, 5 to 12 mm ports were needed to dissect, cross-clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices.	1.7994816820440842
A long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision.	2.0247848212921853
The distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally.	2.3425933557606036
Results: The laparoscopic ABF was performed successfully in 13 of 16 cases.	2.2613089107143267
Three times a conversion to open surgery was requested.	2.3500127431622326
Mean operative time was 292 +/- 60 min; the aorta was crossclamped for 74 +/- 18 min.	2.0808527885664545
Two patients needed transfusions of red blood cells.	2.283805459499024
In the study group, blood loss averaged 566 +/- 434 ml.	2.2062751291306872
The bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography.	2.411908334855127
The patients were discharged 9 +/- 5.8 days after surgery.	2.369400060125644
At follow-up after 4.5 +/- 4 months, 15 patients were examined noninvasively in the vascular laboratory.	2.6168235941652154
All grafts were patent, and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in 14 patients.	2.493025204367192
Conclusions: The laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible, safe and effective procedure.	2.168586931528421
Specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure.	2.3967918226047855
The development of vascular staplers and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge.	1.959507042010217
In the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease.	1.9926713965392722
A 12 year old boy developed the complete symptom complex of Adamantiades-Behçet's disease over a two-year period.	2.1831535846919405
He presented with the mucocutaneous variant with recurrent to persistent oral ulcers which extended into the pharynx, recurrent genital ulcers, perianal lesions, and a positive pathergy test.	2.057203433592205
However, the early onset of the  disease and the male gender indicated a bad prognosis.	2.667389429933315
The patients father deficiency of suffered from bronchial asthma with recurrent respiratory infections.	1.9724320863850777
An IgG-3 subclass was detected.	2.35710135941265
Lymphocyte transformation tests showed markedly diminished response to stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in both patients, while response to PWM, CoA and PHA was normal.	1.8656096260365589
In addition, the concentration of serum soluble interleukin 6 receptor was reduced in both patients.	2.1222798020676956
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of dermatophytes was established.	2.232146493230913
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" amplify a 581 bp fragment within the gene coding for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.	1.7227473786180876
PCR allowed the detection of isolates of 7 common dermatophytes and in addition several yeasts and moulds.	2.2150152729631003
Hybridisation with specific oligonucleotides results in the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.	2.5585359059033914
Restriction analysis of the PCR product allowed us to distinguish between dermatophytes and yeasts or moulds.	2.4593061314930806
The specifity of the PCR with respect to fungi was assessed by testing human DNA collected from 42 dermis and epidermis specimens as well as DNA from selected plants and animals.	2.3778899681107584
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the PCR assay, 69 routinely collected skin and nail specimens were examined by PCR and culture.	2.097164714046092
PCR detected dermatophytes in 35 and culture in 28 of 38 specimens that were classified as positive.	2.187388428832351
Sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).	2.37648489123646
These results show that PCR has advantages over culture for the detection of dermatophytes.	2.358265957900234
Starting with the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", a current empirical stock-taking was undertaken about the structure of care in psychiatric hospital units.	1.9707817564529282
319 treatment units (289 in Germany, 11 in Austria, and 19 in Switzerland) were investigated concerning size of the treatment unit, number of wards, centrality of admission, existence of large observation rooms ("Wachsäle"), spezialized wards, single sex wards, regionalization/sectorization, open-door wards, coercive measures, and intended structural changes.	1.8518030959627843
The return rate of questionnaires amounted 59%.	2.2683836251748946
The results show that the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête" are mostly realized today, but not everywhere.	2.2112252115719686
Across countries differences resulted in size of ward, centrality of admission, open-door wards, and coercive measures.	1.9097194200448586
Treatment units in the western and eastern parts of germany differed in size of ward and centrality of admission.	1.9710749498076998
Differences between psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric departments at general hospitals and psychiatric university hospitals were, though significant, smaller than expected in the light of past controversies.	1.965373797476948
Intended structural changes mainly concerned open-door wards, internal sectorization, decentralization of admission, and mixing the sexes in single sex wards.	1.8400901075470715
Background: The ciliary sulcus as the intended location of transsclerally fixated posterior chamber lenses (PCL) is withdrawn from the surgeon's view.	1.8193187028137623
Using high-resolution ultrasound, we acquire pictures that postoperatively allow us to determine the position of the haptics.	2.357677977078482
Many patients would like to resume some sport activities after total knee replacement; however, most recommendations are based on subjective opinion rather than scientific evidence.	1.9463386358414712
Background: Considering the high recurrence rate after conventional inguinal hernia repair, the totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been used.	2.150548890175346
Methods: The present experience of the authors embraces 1085 patients with a total of 1717 inguinal hernias, including 200 recurrences.	2.3991404035670105
The operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and tricks.	2.26937506846139
Complication rates during and after operation were 0.3 % and 3.3 % respectively.	2.397816676247341
The morbidity rate at 1 month after operation was 3.5 %.	2.4216304093666827
The recurrence rate was 0.3 % at 1-year follow-up.	2.6249359639440284
Careful follow-up is mandatory to assess the late recurrence rate.	3.239473101820509
In approximately 4-10 % of patients presenting with renal cell cancer the transluminal propagation of a tumor thrombus into the vena cava inferior or the right atrium comes to diagnosis.	2.1627069766457163
Recent investigations have indicated that the presence of neoplastic extension into the venous system does not reveal independent prognostic value regarding the clinical course of the disease.	2.2647796021001083
Although the complete surgical removal of vena cava thrombosis in patients without simultaneously occurring regional lymph node or distant metastases has become a well established treatment modality, several questions concerning this surgical strategy still remain the subject of ongoing discussions.	2.034342886704987
In the present investigation that included 92 patients with renal cell cancer and intracaval neoplastic extension it was clearly demonstrated that the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest preferably during the removal of intracaval thrombosis extending into the right atrium does not result in a substantially increased treatment-related intra- or postoperative mortality.	2.055191133843312
However, in contrast to a previously reported observation this treatment option did not reveal any substantial impact on the long-term survival of the patients following surgical therapy.	2.6145205300252097
Accordingly, the cranial extension of intracaval thrombosis was not identified as a biological variable of any prognostic importance for renal cell cancer patients.	2.07455839355469
Vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction.	2.246338436312452
In this category, penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients: males younger than 50 years of age at time of surgery, maximum of two risk factors, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.	2.175190691726184
Long-term success decreased to 53 % to 55 % in comparison to first encouraging reports of 80 % success.	2.207538467520102
Venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the elapse of time after surgery.	2.0363485798082177
Long-term success dropped under 40 %, leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation.	2.113929652048813
In contrast, penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates.	2.103672921924183
Despite this, it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the cavernosal bodies.	2.3806980396750004
Among numerous types of penile implants, preference is nowadays mostly given to the three-piece hydraulic models.	2.0636925712524166
However, such complications as defective or perforated cylinders in up to 35 % after 5 years have arisen, depending on the type of implant.	2.186101848535123
It has been suggested that anhedonia, the loss of pleasure, is associated with a dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	2.1126254116102308
In a series of neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies, we examined pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission in non-human primates and in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	2.061247827523855
Schizophrenics with neuroleptic blockade of striatal dopamine D2 receptors displayed psychomotor slowing and reduced motivation, but not anhedonia.	2.086914077810802
Primate studies pointed to the importance of a temporo-cortical dysfunction in the pathogenesis of phasic dopaminergic dysregulation in the striatum.	2.2727093710977346
These observations indicate that a dysfunction of stimulus-dependent dopamine release may be associated with motivational deficits caused by a reduction in incentive salience, but not with anhedonia.	2.3284789265576524
Any operation for lung cancer that is planned as curative includes dissection of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum in order to allow correct staging of the disease.	2.3346963968389822
It is well known that ipsilateral lymph node metastases (N2) mean a poor prognosis.	2.101990890593761
Since most patients with this finding die from metastatic tumor progression within 3 years after the operation, it can be assumed that positive findings in the mediastinal lymph nodes represent generalization of the cancer.	2.277008330141234
Therefore, the probability of a therapeutic effect from more radical removal of lymph nodes in the mediastinum is rather low.	2.171022886338292
On the other hand, it is justified to apply and evaluate additional systemic treatment in these tumor stages.	2.2392727619703514
In analogy with high-dose contrast-enhanced CT, there have been a few studies during recent years that have dealt with high-dose paramagnetic contrast dyes in MRI.	2.3247476412199757
One reason for these studies was the development of new and low-osmolar contrast agents in the MR field.	2.4999020199152464
Depending on the clinical problem, a high-dose contrast study in MRI is rarely indicated: (1) in metastatic disease, MR imaging with high-dose contrast material is indicated when the standard dose study is negative or only shows a solitary cerebral lesion or a number of lesions just suitable for radiosurgery; (2) in patients with malignant glioma the high-dose study allows better definition of the tumor margins.	2.4335722830226754
If a radical surgical approach is planned, the diagnostic potential should be fully used; if only a biopsy or subtotal debulking is planned, a standard dose study is enough.	1.9777564953288853
(3) in patients with MS, a high-dose study is only recommended within therapeutic trials in which the number of active plaques is a primary variable.	2.9121324491565046
The basic idea of the Collaborative Family Health Care is nothing new.	2.032694111176593
It has its roots in the bio-psycho-social model of medicine developed by George Engel in the U.S.A. and it has a long tradition in the German psychosomatic medicine.	1.934992492081751
At a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note, that Collaborative Family Health Care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action-orientation.	1.8162544378037193
The basic is a systemic view of illness and health.	2.301923876718404
The doctor-patient-dyad is in this view enlarged to a treatment-triad composed of the therapist, the patient and his family, to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal, i.e.	2.037305029076154
the treatment motivation of the patient, the support of the family and the expertize of the therapist.	2.703543216317593
A lot of studies support the resource- saving potential of coopertive methods.	2.0808135008831674
However, their realization is not possible without considerable learning processes of physicians, psychotherapists and other  professionals.	2.136835465717906
A potential has to be mobilized, which affects by no means only the costs.	2.293772444685828
The Collaborative Family Health Care offers new challenges to the professional culture of psychotherapists and new chances for influencing the world of medical health care.	1.8984652588926918
At a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity, the iniitiatives of CFHC offer a possibility for physicians, patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation.	1.8838446049123208
Interested colleagues are invited to collaborate in the German Section of the CFHC.	2.2876248149308585
We evaluated the short- to mid-term results of an unconstrained total ankle prosthesis (S. T. A. R.) with uncemented fixation.	2.1495395506469017
Fifty consecutive ankle replacements were performed in 48 patients between 1996 and 1999.	2.4143054301498212
The initial diagnosis was posttraumatic osteoarthrosis in 31 cases (62 %), primary osteoarthrosis in 8 cases (16 %), and systemic joint affection in 11 cases (22 %), e. g. rheumatoid arthritis (6 cases), hemochromatosis (2 cases), psoriasis arthritis (1 case), lupus erythematodes (1 case), and sclerodermia (1 case).	2.1747052129555318
Seven revisions, all in cases of posttraumatic arthrosis, were necessary: local revision of the fibula for painful lateral impingement (3 cases), posteromedial soft tissue revision for painful restriction of dorsiflexion (2 cases), percutaneous lengthening of the Achilles tendon (1 case), and osteotomy and callus distraction for angular correction after stress fracture of the distal tibia (1 case).	2.065063563095337
At the last follow-up control, 21 patients (62 %) were very satisfied, 10 patients (29 %) were satisfied, and 3 patients (9 %) were satisfied with reservations.	2.492570549229313
The obtained range of motion was 30  ° (range, 15 to 55  °), with a maximal plantarflexion of 25  ° (range, 15 to 45  °) and dorsiflexion of 5  ° (-3 to 20  °).	2.1881290265135527
When the AOFAS-Hindfoot-Score was applied, the 34 patients scored 84.1 points (range, 44 to 100 points).	1.9081501890985857
After settling of the implants within 6 weeks, no migration was noted in any case, and all implants were considered to be stable.	2.5362806422662016
The favorable results were considered to be a result of the mechanical properties of the S. T. A. R. total ankle prosthesis that allows for unconstrained motion of the polyethylene inlay on the tibial component, e. g. anteroposterior translation, mediolateral translation and axial rotation.	2.126658823092327
The success of implantation may depend on exact technique, correct hindfoot alignement, sufficient capsuloligamentous stability of the ankle, and a solid bone stock.	2.2219007962968056
In a prospective study, the influence of the status of the peri-implant hard and soft tissues on the success of enosseous dental implants in tumor patients was assessed.	2.3436862074674063
Out of 59 tumor patients with 261 implants, treated between July 1988 and August 1996, a pool of 23 patients with 99 implants provided with dentures for at least 1 year was obtained.	1.9128889536731741
Eighteen of these patients suffered from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.	3.17320876159249
Seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiation (40 Gy).	2.1994601080015577
A total of 68 out of 99 implants were inserted into autologous bone transplanted to reconstruct the mandible.	2.0046215640443643
In order to assess the peri-implant hard and soft tissues, the Hygiene Index, the Sulcus Bleeding Index, the Gingiva Index, the pocket-probing depth, the peri-implant bone resorption, and the periotest were used.	2.0057574214133393
The results in the tumor patients were compared with the results in a pool of nontumor patients.	3.110140287042962
Tumor patients had significantly worse peri-implant parameters than nontumor patients.	2.1381703308083946
The peri-implant pocket-probing depth proved to have significant influence on the success rate.	2.3916874379038884
The overall success rate was 77.8%.	2.343759354611067
Many articles in the literature document the fact that postoperative pain therapy has not improved for decades despite new insights into pain physiology, the availability of powerful analgesics and the development of new techniques.	2.4159272390497533
This project was set up to develop practical, effective, safe, and easy to run acute pain therapy.	1.9932162619104155
A 26-year-old man sustained a C2 arc fracture.	2.5249993065003156
Ventral spondylodesis using an H-plate was performed.	2.2879956941194672
The patient developed a pharyngovertebral fistula which remained undetected for 1 year.	2.1118210235720043
Spontaneous fusion of C3/C4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred.	1.9840096416790634
The fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was transorally removed.	2.348829558293731
No further problems occurred after this unusual method of treatment.	2.338998044694528
The anatomy of the cervical spine, special problems of intensive care patients and the use of proper instrumentation are discussed.	2.99038636905472
48 hours later the block was still partially present.	2.314988550545047
Paraesthesia and a sensory and motor innervation deficit affected mainly the dorsal fascicle, but also areas innervated by the median and lateral fascicles.	2.0329051382346717
The deficit did not completely disappear for 18 month.	2.2013908644822835
The cause could have been due to direct traumatisation during blockade or operation, toxic action of the injected substance (Bupivacain 0,5%, 30 ml), distension of the plexus, a cervical syndrome or an aseptic plexitis, although a definite determination is not possible.	1.9949921919356233
However, the pattern of the lesion and the lack of pain during localisation of the plexus and injection favour traumatisation during the acromioplasty.	2.3223547235109394
Microfilm photography allows documentation of naevi in a map-like fashion.	2.074338452014469
The localization of multiple naevi is no longer a problem, as one can scan the film.	2.1757390949326516
Comparison of the magnified film with the patient can be done in day-light.	2.3399892558245967
Magnification up to 48 times is possible.	2.442510505007057
In the ancient times, Aristotle, Herophilos, and Galen discovered basic anatomical structures.	1.8860502083687338
Paul von Aegina, in the seventh century a. c., had the idea of a nerve suture, which was first performed in an animal 1000 years later by the Italian surgeon Gabriele Ferrara.	2.145899554595103
Systematic investigations on nerve crossing date to the beginning of the nineteenth century and were conducted by Jean Pierre Flourens.	2.0043881695224854
Within 1 week in summer 1864, two French surgeons (Laugier and Nélaton) independently carried out the first nerve sutures in humans.	1.7511194109319441
Their observations of an immediate functional recovery of the appropriate muscles after suturing were discussed controversially in scientific circles.	1.9804161781049718
Purpose: To analyze the value of electrophysiologic testing according to standards of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) in infants less than 10 years of age.	1.9976502857468017
Aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) is a tumor of the soft tissues predominantely occurring in the genital and pelvic area with a strong propensity to local recurrences.	2.2588730751472177
The entity was first described in 1983.	2.592815222543766
The tumor is regarded as low-grade sarcoma by some authors; its cause and pathogenesis are presently unknown.	2.197826076288804
This is a case report on a 27-year-old man who underwent 4 surgical procedures of the left lower extremity because of a recurrent soft tissue neoplasm, initially (August 1993) diagnosed as a myxolipoma.	2.320693172762751
The patient suffered from recurrences in February 1995, September 1996 and February 1998.	2.098734433553148
The diagnosis was revised at the time of the latest recurrence.	2.466737889595294
A palliative resection with macroscopic residuals left was performed in February 1998, followed by a radiation therapy with 56 Gy total dose and a concomitant administration of the radiosensitizer razoxane per os.	2.1580931507731362
The single radiation doses were 200 cGy 5 times a week.	2.1037990108911218
The small residuals of the tumor obviously regressed although an objective response could not be shown because the lesion was not clearly measurable.	2.3084070705316306
A follow-up 2 years after the radiation treatment revealed no recurrence.	2.8824833580356195
The time of the local control achieved as yet is already longer than any former time to regrowth between the surgical procedures.	2.218900739158953
This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a therapeutic irradiation of a recurrent aggressive angiomyxoma.	2.4560039188195875
Radiation therapy combined with the sensitizer razoxane is able to control a recurrent AAM for an unknown time.	2.180549833517597
It remains open whether a radiation treatment alone would have had a similar effect.	2.1008643983732407
Micronervereconstruction of motor and sensitive nerves in the head and neck area today has an established range of indications.	2.185175028412149
Surgical procedures of external and internal neurolyses, nerve coaptation and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized.	1.9663574735049878
With microneurosurgery of motor nerves, satisfying or good results can be generally obtained.	2.1094196877730154
Success rates exceeding 50% following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures, more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient.	2.248931019897144
Perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts, e.g., by development of minimally invasive, eventually endoscopically guided procedures.	2.05704342145115
Allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied.	2.938167885110431
Initial experiments with nerve distractions are encouraging.	2.347492850503807
A better understanding of nerve lesions on cellular and molecular biological levels may improve our knowledge of posttraumatic regulatory procedures and may lead to future possibilities of nonsurgical treatment options for peripheral and central nerve lesions by guided regeneration.	2.0400796349943926
Objective: The acceptance of fibromyalgia as a disease entity and its definitive diagnosis have been hampered by a dearth of knowledge concerning the underlying pathophysiology of this disease and the lack of specific biochemical markers applicable to its diagnosis.	2.041958567537037
To determine whether abnormal collagen metabolism is a characteristic of fibromyalgia, we have analyzed collagen metabolites in the urine and serum of patients with fibromyalgia.	2.381586067355144
Methods: The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria.	2.5713031431722073
Urine and serum were collected under standardized conditions from 39 patients and 55 age- and sex-matched controls.	2.0470848276989484
Levels of hydroxypyroline (Hyp), a collagen turnover marker, were also measured.	2.218267481893498
The findings were related to creatinine levels and the Pyd/Dpyd ratio determined.	2.133539013240209
The Pyd/Dpyd ratios in the urine and serum and the Hyp in the urine were significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls.	2.341142605635815
Conclusion: Decreased levels of collagen cross-linking may contribute to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and collagen deposition around the nerve fibers in fibromyalgia and contribute to the lower pain threshold at the tender points.	1.9477744451669492
Analysis of altered collagen metabolism either by histologic examination on biopsy or, preferably, by HPLC analysis of collagen metabolites in urine or serum may aid to understand more about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia.	1.9330786402339912
Background: The dynamic radionuclide nephrography (Tc99m-MAG3) is an important method in the evaluation of obstruction of the upper urinary tract.	2.588529698255273
The aim of the present study was to assess whether radionuclid nephrography under standardized conditions with adequate hydration and Furosemid induced diuresis can reliably detect a significant obstruction at the pelvi-ureteric junction.	1.7520065506672915
We therefore tested whether minimal tracer washout (10-25%) in the presence of normal renal function could justity a non-operative managment.	2.5856692454215384
The lateral decubitus position is the standard position for nephrectomies.	2.4049897183216085
There is a lack of data about the effects of this extreme position upon respiratory mechanics and gas exchange.	2.221313202636611
In 20 patients undergoing surgery in the nephrectomy position, we compared a new closed-loop-controlled ventilation algorithm, adaptive lung ventilation (ALV), which adapts the breathing pattern automatically, to the respiratory mechanics with conventionally controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV).	2.125582179057338
The aims of our study were (1) to describe positioning effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, (2) to compary ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller with traditional settings of CMV, and (3) to assess the individual adaptation of the ventilatory parameters by the ALV controller.	2.223346863201905
The respirator used was a modified Amadeus ventilator, which is controlled by an external computer and possesses an integrated lung function analyzer.	2.1416138107381157
In a first set of measurements, we compared parameters of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in the horizontal supine position and 20 min after changing to the nephrectomy position.	2.066382950156983
In a second set of measurements, patients were ventilated with ALV and CMV using a randomized crossover design.	2.0323544977716144
The CMV settings were a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg body weight, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min, an I:E ratio of 1:1.5, and an end-inspiratory pause of 30% of inspiratory time.	2.0846827683471774
With both ventilation modes FiO2 was set to 0.5 and PEEP to 3 cm H2O.	2.026229026655117
During ALV a desired alveolar ventilation of 70 ml/kg KG - min was preset.	2.116245724603191
All other ventilatory parameters were determined by the ALV controller according to the instantaneously measured respiratory parameters.	2.574706266506903
Positioning induced a reduction of compliance from 61.6 to 47.9 ml/cm H2O; the respiratory time constant shortened from 1.2 to 1.08 s, whereas physiological dead space increased from 158.9 to 207.5 ml.	1.7673645420981585
On average, the ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller resembled very closely those used with CMV.	1.926688441462519
However, an adaptation to individual respiratory mechanics was clearly evident with ALV.	1.9861037914228095
In conclusion, we found that the effects of positioning for nephrectomy are minor and may give rise to problems only in patients with restrictive lung disease.	2.487962708143279
The novel ALV controller automatically selects ventilatory parameters that are clinically sound and are better adapted to the respiratory mechanics of ventilated patients than the standardized settings of CMV are.	1.9045127649507985
Noma is an ulcerative-necrotizing gingivo-stomatitis eventually leading to severe destruction of the midface, including lips and cheek, maxilla/mandible, nose and rarely the orbit.	1.766398306190571
The defects are usually unilateral.	2.563313722293085
Children from economically underdeveloped countries are predominantly affected.	2.200875108227055
Medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate, which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time.	2.3394689266646393
Predisposing factors include malnourishment, immunosuppression, and poor oral hygiene.	2.1219063791238297
Forty-eight noma patients were surgically treated in Sokoto, Nigeria during October 1997 by an Interplast Germany team sponsored by AWD Stiftung Kinderhilfe.	1.707651820022777
Interdisciplinary surgical strategies and results, e. g. ankylosis release, local flap coverage and 12 pedicled musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi island flaps, as well as a noma classification (NOMAC), are presented.	2.098313399801473
During a period of 3 years, four controled clinical studies in 34 patients with hypercholesterolaemia and 40 healthy persons - in some cases with stratification of the basic cholesterol levels and matched pair formation - were performed to find out the effects of serial sun-like UV irradiation on various serum parameters and blood circulation functions.	2.0496176000888404
The following significant effects were observed.	2.476027315017745
Patients with hypercholesterolaemia: increase of HDL cholesterol after termination of the serial UV irradiation, increase of serum 25 (OH)D3 levels, decrease of serum triiodothyronine, decrease of serum lactate; healthy persons: decrease of resting pulse rate, decrease of recovery pulse rate, decrease of systolic blood pressure.	1.779479275238589
All effects were induced by application of suberythematous UV doses, i.e.	2.14225433006984
amounts of UV with a relatively low risk of side effects.	2.5542051453098997
In 1998 Minor et al.	2.3630359503027045
described a new variant of perilymphatic fistula: the "superior canal dehiscence syndrome".	2.0972269985661582
This syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure.	1.800742783199712
It is caused by a dehiscence of bone overlying the superior (anterior) semicircular canal.	2.1629929837683015
Due to this dehiscence, a third, mobile window (in addition to the round and oval windows) is formed, and changes in pressure are pathologically transduced to the anterior semicircular canal.	1.9462112486688454
In the present study we evaluated proprioceptive capabilities of the knee joint with a balance test and correlated these findings to parameters which document mechanical stability.	1.9589919934405884
We compared 8 conservatively treated and 12 surgically treated patients with ACL-deficient knee joints with a control group of 12 subjects.	2.2250219983518176
Both the conservatively treated and the surgically treated patients showed significantly higher deviations of their centre of gravity than the control group.	2.0795253720513833
This was true not only for the injured leg but also for the noninjured contralateral leg.	2.193456516665997
The differences were most remarkable when comparing the entire distance of centre of gravity deviations during 10 s. Additionally, the conservatively treated patients interrupted the test procedure significantly more frequently than the other two groups.	1.897051509222317
The study examined the validity of psychometric measures for the assessment of driving ability in brain-damaged subjects.	2.241201646838872
116 patients with brain damage mainly of vascular and traumatic origin underwent  extensive neuropsychological examinations emphasizing attentional performance and visual perceptual speed and participated in a comprehensive on-road driving test.	1.8278393650711116
Attempts to predict the outcome of the driving test by discriminant analysis or cut-off procedures based on neuropsychological and/or other subject-related data yielded a maximum of 73% correct predictions.	2.213891216444827
In view of the frequent impairment in driving ability after brain damage and in view of the failure to reliably predict driving ability from psychometric test results, it is recommended that in each case an on-road driving test is given.	2.0426658379925633
In the planning of laser surgery for ENT operations, the specialist is often consulted by the anesthesiologist to predict possible intubation problems.	1.9918668642155681
Intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes.	2.305611447238707
The aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ENT-related laser surgery.	1.8074111318774289
In a prospective study, 91 patients were included and the Mallampati-score modified by Samsoon and Young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation.	1.9694042551607915
The results showed a significant correlation (p <0.05, Chi-Square test).	2.318252445443053
However, the specificity was only 72% and the sensitivity of 60% was too low to be of practical use.	2.0621113421558634
The results were independent of the endotracheal tube used.	2.661830301853314
Although use of the laser for ENT operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist, there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use.	2.364857393712282
This problem is demonstrated in a literature  review.	2.66357950369057
The treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge.	2.5016710165978173
We report on a 12 year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to NHL-BFM 95: Block AA protocol.	2.081259782487654
During his therapy, he developed a thrombosis of his right femoral vein and pulmonary embolism affecting the left segments 4, 5, 8, and 9.	2.2646662343016404
Therefore, we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the Amplatz thrombectomy device.	2.213212188318995
The postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion; dopplersonography 4 months postinterventionally showed a patent right femoral vein.	1.9119620574287954
Within this chapter, tumors which produce bone matrix (osteoid) or other bone-forming tissues, like cartilage, connective tissue, and cementum or originate within the bone marrow are described.	1.8504741713671335
In addition, those lesions are mentioned which, according to the WHO, are typical for the jawbones and are therefore included within the 1992 WHO classification of odontogenic tumors.	2.0749498729265428
Vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described.	2.6059416117364482
All the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance.	2.2055900464130915
A precise diagnosis, therefore, can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field.	2.4059526821476194
In addition to clinical, radiological, and histological appearances, therapeutic necessities are described.	2.15378759357111
The data from recent publications are taken into account.	2.3235155722988208
This presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the German-Austrian-Swiss Study Group of Tumors of the Face and Jaws (DÖSAK) in Basel.	2.125074027017685
Between 1987 and 1996 302 patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases.	2.5404763575466225
Out of this pool 252 completely documented cases were analysed.	2.1486089453774806
Forty-five patients (18 %) of this population were 70 years or older at time of admission.	2.375619504250602
In this population 17 major resections and 8 minor liver resections were performed.	2.061832246107655
In 9 patients irresectable metastases were diagnosed during treatment of the primary tumor.	2.463095449631742
Eight patients were treated without surgery.	3.017112367496783
Mortality after liver resection was 4 %, morbidity 28 %.	2.476806842623781
The 5-year-survival-rate (Kaplan-Meier) of the R0 resected patients (n = 21) was 44 %.	2.4684040347516967
Comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease.	2.482697564317325
Survival, morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences.	2.843614492947124
These results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed efficently and with a curative intention.	2.3547049864934273
The clinical course of 12 patients with mushroom poisoning was evaluated in order to define the parameters considered to be relevant to the indication for liver transplantation.	2.726946436552805
Eight patients recovered under conservative therapy; one patient died due to pre-existing, concomitant cardiopulmonary disease.	2.1797040403795203
In three patients transplantations had to be performed because of severe liver failure.	2.617093782174352
On admission, the transplanted patients had a decreased Quick's test score and factor V value (< 10 %).	2.116856659056932
The peak of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, partial thromboplastin time and azotemia were not of any prognostic value.	1.9444120298258407
Main indications for liver transplantation were a very low initial Quick's test score and factor V value (both < 10 %) and their inadequate response under substitution therapy.	1.9625613279551635
The development of encephalopathy and renal failure were further parameters indicating poor prognosis.	1.9761079491994398
During submaximal isotonic back extension loading (31 male persons) surface-EMG was measured using 16 monopolar-linked electrodes in the low back region (L 3-S 1).	1.814357274929666
By means of modification of amplitude- and frequency parameters in the EMG-signal two subject groups (6 persons each) with the slightest and most severe muscle fatigue in the paraspinal region were defined.	1.7595561667111848
For the analysis of muscle coordination, the EMG signal on the basis of an amplitude estimate at the beginning and at the end of the load situation was compared.	2.4759700896020598
During the extension phase, the group with slight fatigability showed no different spatial pattern of myoelectrical activity at the end of investigation than at the beginning.	2.160869280082429
In contrast to this, the pattern of myoelectrical activity changed during the endurance test in the group of persons with considerable fatigability.	2.2395306784560534
Therefore, in addition to the muscular fatigue also the loss of muscle coordination has to be taken into account in the assessment of spinal function.	2.594920898931975
Background: A fractional flow reserve (FFRmyo) <0.75 is a well validated parameter for significance of coronary stenoses in cases of normal myocardial function.	2.121550018230663
We used the FFRmyo limit in patients with impaired myocardial perfusion by myocardial infarction and/or hypertension for intermediate stenoses of the LAD for decision to PTCA and checked the indication by clinical follow-up.	2.2580153826759193
Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia.	2.5418056116929
Usually, a non-continuous distraction mode is applied.	2.549907181819988
The aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder.	2.0592124271294985
Using a submandibular approach, the mandible was dissected subperiostally on one side in four mini-pigs; corticotomy was performed and the microhydraulic cylinder fixed with two bicortical screws.	1.9208247593820673
The hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic hydropneumatic injector system.	2.1313997187308895
Following 7 days at rest, a continuous distraction of 1.5 mm per day was performed for 14 days.	2.160321452679736
After 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively, the animals were killed and X-rays taken.	2.4425627588459258
The mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed.	2.238008986056116
The microhydraulic cylinder was easy to apply and to handle.	2.3434371401447476
The continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles.	1.9025775474233497
Bony regeneration seems to be accelerated, which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase.	2.520367574104096
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in infants is short compared to adult patients.	2.059618963054223
When tetracaine is used, the addition of epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration.	2.3361754612069827
For bupivacaine, however, the influence of epinephrine on the duration is not clear.	3.053829944214447
We investigated the effects of epinephrine 1: 200 000 added to bupivacaine 0.5% on duration and haemodynamics.	2.130052120413084
Ten former pre-term infants with postnatal respiratory problems, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair, were enrolled in the study after informed parental consent had been obtained.	2.027032646194546
The infants were fasted at least 4 h prior to surgery.	2.1473295641693015
If they did not receive i.v.	2.341224181466017
infusions before surgery, a bolus of 10 ml/kg Ringer's acetate was injected after inserting the i.v.	2.073048316756063
cannula, followed by a continuous infusion of 8 ml/kg 2/3 N NaCl with 5% dextrose.	2.3642169037279084
Spinal anaesthesia was performed in a sitting position with 0.6 ml bupivacaine 0.5%.	2.4713004856355654
Five patients received plain bupivacaine (group I) and five bupivacaine with epinephrine 1: 200 000 (group II).	2.1020440851488695
Heart rate registered by ECG and non-invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to positioning the baby for lumbar puncture and 2, 5, 10, and 20 min after injection of bupivacaine.	2.240154645195856
The duration of spinal anaesthesia was defined as the time from injection to the time when the first movements of the legs were observed after stimulation.	2.3808219346229333
For testing statistical differences the U test was used between the groups and the Wilcoxon and Wilcox test within the groups.	2.111489865421437
Results (expressed as median and range).	2.233376741220364
Haemodynamic parameters did not differ at any time between or within the groups.	2.4204120896786776
In group I, one infant had high spinal anaesthesia with impaired respiration but without cardiovascular effects; after 10 min of assisted ventilation by mask, sufficient respiration as judged by pulse oximetry and clinical observation had returned.	1.7782060850853298
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in this child was 60 min.	2.158821184678898
Epinephrine 1: 200 000 significantly prolongs the duration of spinal anaesthesia in former preterm infants.	2.320115158908677
Haemodynamic parameters in this age group remain unchanged during spinal anaesthesia and are not influenced by the addition of epinephrine.	2.324593753560396
Purpose: Debate about the potential implementation of Spiral-CT in diagnostic algorithms of pulmonary embolism are often focussed on sensitivity and specificity in the context of comparative methodologic studies.	2.0969694255335436
We intend to investigate whether additional factors might influence this debate.	2.3230104684403554
Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) should be an "evidence-based" diagnosis derived from clinical and echocardiographic screening of informed and consenting relatives of index patients, and on the examination of clinical reports for deceased relatives.	2.1633611381098286
Most familial dilated cardiomyopathy pedigrees show an autosomal pattern of inheritance.	2.1863708818316145
Very few of them are X-linked and matrilinear.	2.5257683803637954
Autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence-based setting.	2.3873623418265346
By linkage analysis, several loci, but no disease gene, have been identified.	2.5162753178433004
At present, few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis.	2.084962023678992
As the results of the structural reform policy regulating the health care sector, the paper presents the possible path of increasing intrasectoral risk selection and intersectoral risk externalization (especially between the law of health care insurance, the law of statutory nursing inusrance, and the German poverty law).	2.0575292175504827
Particularly the new developments in the hospital sector will be analzyed regarding the dynamics of risk selection and risk externalization.	2.2829008755623743
The new economic ways of financing the hospital sector are inducing the need of systematic integration of the different branches of social law, especially more developed networks of the health care, the nursing system, and the social care services.	2.293782966055574
Purpose: The inactive form of pyruvatekinase could be established in different tumours.	2.2404732478169738
Purpose of this study was to demonstate the presence or absence of the inactive form of pyruvatekinase in renal cell carcinoma, metastases and benign renal tissue by immunohistology.	2.2790507525775316
Introduction: The hemodynamic parameters of 95 patients undergoing maxillary or bimaxillary orthognathic surgery in 1996 and 1997 at the Department of OMF Surgery/Plastic Surgery, Krefeld, Germany, were analyzed retrospectivly to study the effect of intraoperative blood loss.	2.047339533785165
Materials and methods: The parameters included the blood loss volume, age, weight and sex of the patients, the mode of osteotomy and the operation time, the surgeon, the average blood pressure, the infusion volume, the anesthesiologist, the thrombocyte counts and their function, the activity of the coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and von-Willebrand-factor, and the pathological coagulation factor counts of each patient, the rate of autologous blood donation and the rate of retransfusion.	2.245380033911908
Statistical analysis was done using the Speraman-Rho-test.	2.2200524600020417
Men lost about 300 ml more than women.	2.2485275232640847
Operations of more than 3.5 h in length led to a blood loss of 1200  +/-  520 ml as opposed to 670  +/-  310 ml.	2.0840237526405048
The average blood loss among various surgeons was between 670 ml and 1180 ml of various anesthesiologists between 730 ml and 1200 ml, without statistical evidence.	1.7505984273014288
Some 17.9% of patients showed pathological thrombocytic function concerning medication with aspirin; 34.7% had pathological activities of coagulation factors, but only 2.1% with clinical significance.	1.8840166401974532
Conclusion: Mode of operation, maxillary or bimaxillary, und length of operation were the most significant factors of intraoperative blood loss.	2.096586430082739
Patients with pathological coagulation had nearly the same rate of blood loss as patients with physiological coagulation.	2.147300337389447
In most cases this was determined by restriction of aspirin.	2.355151775520994
Analysis of the rate of autologous blood retransfusion showed a significant correlation to blood loss in bimaxillary surgery.	2.509569594364977
Maxillary osteotomy led to a retransfusion of only 14.2% of autologous blood unit.	2.414917866292525
This should be reviewed critically especially concerning costs.	2.203647211371268
Purpose: Course and pathophysiology of a typical syndrome after irradiation of the cauda equina were studied.	2.1422808858869637
Wells' syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis) is a rare inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis.	2.499259881493184
Only 18 cases in childhood have been reported.	2.5182982855138416
We report on a 5-year-old girl who showed the typical biphasic and recurrent course of the disease: initially edematous-cellulitic lesions associated with blisters, followed by morphea-like changes on the extremities.	2.2047622020406172
Eosinophilia of peripheral blood was apparent, which, however, was not correlated with the severity of the current condition.	2.932457047860704
After a recurrent course for 4 months and intermittent systemic administration of antibiotics (on the assumption of erysipelas and phlegmon) and glucocorticosteroids, the disease healed without sequelae.	1.9885327412354854
Trigger factors or systemic hematologic malignancy could not be detected.	2.497541656538595
Diskussion: Wells' syndrome is probably more common than believed and should be included in the differential diagnosis of urticarial, morphea-like and bullous eruptions in childhood.	2.041644095441195
In 1996, several employees of the French governmental organization for Blood Collection and Transfusions (CNTS) have been condemned by ordinary courts.	1.8317038626444464
They were found guilty in the affair on HIV-infected blood transfusions.	2.1585608915124674
Over 3800 persons, mostly hemophiliacs, have been infected in France and suffer from HIV disease.	2.0809538434047816
The public in France urgently demanded the condemnation of the persons who were politically responsible for the time delay that postponed the introduction of HIV-tests for blood donations in France.	2.002364095816486
Such a test was available from the american company ABBOTT in the early 1985, but the french authorities preferred to wait for the HIV-Test from Pasteur-Diagnostics.	2.0139694824964187
A special court, the "Court de Justice de la République", authorized to judge on members of  the governement, has been created by the French Parliament on Nov. 23, 1993.	1.7955665930909726
Six years later, the three politicians, the former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, the minister for  Social Affairs, Mme Georgina Dufoix, and  her undersecretary of state for health, Mr.  Edmond Hervé, have been accused of involuntary homicide.	1.7339004106150908
March, 9, 1999, after five weeks of deliberations and statements, the CJR rendered his sentence: The former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and the Minister  G. Dufoix were discharged, but the secretary of state for health, Edmond Hervé, has been declared guilty.	1.791694803125431
However, also Mr. Hervé could leave the court room as a free person, because the President of the Court, Mr. Christian Le Gunehec, didn't want to pronounce a judgement against him, as Mr. Hervé had to suffer from almost 15 years of public  critics and attacks before he was found guilty.	1.6400575332386598
The hemophiliacs and other AIDS-patients as well as their families protested loudly against this judgement.	2.338322919201353
They plan to file charges against the three ministers through a common court to hold them responsible.	1.898155811422461
Classical insight therapy, derived from Freud, and `maternal' holding therapy, derived from Balint, Winnicott and others, are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis.	1.812302619478541
The authors believe that each of these two techniques presupposes specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings.	2.2236147391763827
The position of Freud is that of the basically traumatic character of human experience.	2.2134274389347803
The contra-position of the object relation psychologists stipulates the priority of love in human experience.	2.037701385058156
Univentricular hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations.	2.2618162194799876
We report a case of a 34-year old male with single ventricle, two atria, tricuspid atresia, large atrial septal defect, complete transposition and pulmonary valvar stenosis.	2.1372270286076107
There were no signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension.	2.326271288379018
Intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years.	2.964938009138671
Conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation.	2.4776260886501853
The patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession, family and some sportive activities like squash.	1.8690538361792037
He died of sudden cardiac death.	2.862402783158841
The malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development.	2.3393978641940936
Clinical picture, prognosis and therapy are reported from literature.	2.495085585750759
During the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results.	2.293557230165274
Special morphologic constellations, as in our case, may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life.	2.358372012195968
The assessment and measurement of pain is essential in the implementation and control of pain relieving strategies.	2.296769535573774
The measurement of pain in infants and children should be based on the consideration of age, cognitive level, psychological status, intercurrent diseases and the social context in order to register the child's individual situation and to avoid misinterpretation.	2.3005430226816164
From its origin to its death the human organism is submitted to functional, material and morphological changes that are perceptible.	1.9492950324641085
But this estimation is not always correct.	2.6275992670204564
Some appear younger, some older than expected from their chronological age.	2.106719414668395
But what is ageing and how can it be measured?	2.326003577958356
For this, so-called markers or biological markers of ageing are used which are measurable indicators of ageing in live organisms.	2.005032192169817
A description of the complexity, the asynchronous course and the biological variety and variability of biological age is less successful with a single indicator than with the inclusion of several markers in a multi-factorial measuring system, in a so-called test battery.	2.1754960820892757
Various test batteries have already been applied in numerous studies that consist of biochemical scans, mental and also social parameters in different combinations.	1.9621550974528688
A more precise description of such a test battery can be seen in the following discussion of the ILSE study.	2.5990529582905157
The documentation form for pathohistologic findings (version III) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented.	2.1150365019676785
Its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the ICD-O classification and the TNM system.	2.42093135251185
The prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	2.024046557807498
By means of a multicentric observational study the German Austrian Swiss co-operative group DÖSAK will develop a new prognostic model for oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	1.871845744216998
The development of a middle ear cholesteatoma is usually associated with chronic inflammation and displacement of the mucosa present by the invading squamous epithelium.	2.1223008117131683
To analyze the clinically different behaviors of both epithelia, we used immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and expression of interleukin-1 (Il-1), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-), epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), the proliferation marker MIB 1, c-myc proto-oncogene product and activation marker 4F2.	2.094012400503115
Results stromal that keratinocytes in a cholesteatoma exhibited a much higher activation and proliferation rate when compared to middle ear mucosa cells.	2.0544159624767504
Middle ear epithelial cells showed no immunoreactivity for TGF-alpha, EGF-R, Il-1 and c-myc in contrast to the markedly positive immunoreactivity found in cholesteatoma matrix.	2.0625266380052145
The local release of cytokines and growth factors, such as TGF-alpha, EGF and Il-1 by inflammatory cells seems to be an important factor for the hyperproliferative behavior of cholesteatoma epithelium.	2.246062933389209
Our findings could contribute to the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma and give a possible explanation for the sustained progression of its growth leading to displacement of the middle ear mucosa.	2.381738568470195
The role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter.	2.2103483516645666
This paper reports the results of the Austrian ultrasound hip screening program, in which all Austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice: at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12-16 weeks.	2.144962001420546
Data from all public health insurance companies since 1985 and all ICD data about children hospitalized because of CDH in Austria were collected and analyzed.	1.9031996873898858
The rate of sonographically pathological hips was 6.57 % (1994).	1.9703986051639497
The treatment rate before introduction of hip sonography was 13.16 % (1985).	2.057596016150208
Hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia.	3.039544425208947
The optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only "high risk" hips (clinical instability, positive family history, breech delivery) should undergo hip sonography, but at an age between 4 and 6 weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature.	1.8543585003155485
Since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening, a further reduction of costs could be accomplished.	2.3250145212900133
Disability owing to DDH can be avoided in a number of cases, and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be economized.	2.687706645896042
Transactional analysis (Berne 1958) in its original concepts was intended to help even lay people to understand personal structures and psychodynamic processes.	1.8419571260214485
This intention lead some of the following authors to superficiality and a "happy-go-lucky" perspective.	2.173414605260122
Others, most of all European transactional analysts went back to the roots of the original contents and aims and showed that they offer great clinical relevance for the understanding and treatment of a variety of disturbances.	2.280452359875068
This article will illustrate these aspects, using the borderline syndrome as an example.	2.2699234272280524
The structural model of egostates serves to describe the borderline structure, concepts of the frame of reference and the script as patterns for the development and maintenance of the pathology, the concepts of transactions, games, symbioses and passivity as indicators for the stable instability of the relationships, and devaluations and grandiosities as examples of defence patterns.	1.8820253470494803
Practical ideas about the therapeutic contract as a basis of various working agreements, about methods of decreasing anxiety in therapeutic processes, and about contact and attachment as a substrate for corrective experiences, a healing atmosphere and dedramatisation of the process follow.	1.7569052409435697
After separation of symblepharons in ocular pemphigoid, transplantation of nasal or bucal mucosa is recommended to prevent recurrent lid fusion; however, it is not always successful.	2.1369670264171194
The disturbance of generalized cheerfulness (serene-calmness disorder) is an illness, which is often recognised very late.	2.226962781664352
It is characterised by a uniformity of psychic experience in the face of circumstances which would otherwise give cause for depressiveness, despair, great anxiety, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.	1.8366606769353184
Early diagnosis and specific therapy may decisively improve life-quality of the patients and may also prevent detrimental individual and social long-term consequences.	2.701620847136012
Disturbances of microcirculation in coronary artery disease can be seen in the presence of critical stenosis of epicardial coronary arteries, as a result of endothelial dysfunction in the absence of significant stenosis or during recovery of ischaemic myocardium after successful angioplasty of stenosed or occluded coronary arteries.	2.3490325337266196
Diagnostic methods are morphologic/morphometric analyses, measurement of the global coronary reserve, measurement of the regional coronary microcirculation (scintigraphy, positron emission tomography) and laboratory analysis of haemorheological alterations (plasma, erythrocytes, leucocytes).	1.8767493890751994
After successful angioplasty, normalisation of glutamate extraction rate takes three to six months.	1.9991622019292465
In patients with unstable angina, changes in plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil activation occur.	2.0897754678287246
Neutrophils are activated after successful angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction and even after elective angioplasty (when measured in the coronary sinus).	2.251559410747285
Therapeutic improvements of disturbed microvascular flow can be obtained by increasing perfusion pressure (by revascularisation, nitrates, calcium antagnoists, physical training), by improving the fluidity of the blood and by reducing the extravascular component of coronary vascular resistance (by antihypertensive treatment).	1.9385852210692118
Intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI) extracted from testicular tissue (TESE) represents the only possibility for men with non-obstructive azoospermia to father a child.	1.9242471117129651
ICSI is also the only treatment for men with obstructive azoospermia if microsurgery is not possible or not successful.	2.2430347953044008
However, approximately only every fifth treatment cycle leads to a pregnancy.	2.293868497877981
Thus, in most cases, several treatment cycles have to be performed to achieve a pregnancy and therefore testicular biopsies have to be taken several times.	2.736226348769056
Cryopreservation of testicular tissue offers the possibility to store testicular tissue for several treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and to detach surgical sperm retrieval in the man and infertility treatment in the woman (ovarian stimulation, ovum pick-up, embryo transfer).	1.9165170328449126
For the man, cryopreservation offers the advantage that only one testicular biopsy has to be performed for diagnostic reasons and for sperm retrieval.	2.2387140094072246
The advantage for the women is that infertility treatment is started only if testicular histology confirms spermatids, at least in the testicular tissue.	1.9416908028390598
The cumulative pregnancy rate of IVF/ICSI/TESE-cycles can be increased by cryopreservation of supernumerary pronuclear stage oocytes and embryo transfer after thawing in successive cycles.	1.726284786099357
This study gives a survey of the publications of articles about the care of the newborn around 1900.	2.252375668685142
A main paediatric and obstetric journal (Archiv für Kinderheilkunde, Archiv für Gynäkologie) from the turn of the century were analysed including the years 1885-1910.	1.7024019342959036
Purpose: To compare electron beam CT (EBCT) und prospectively ECG gated conventional CT for the detection and quantification of coronary artery calcifications.	2.2101902430720974
In Europe, saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery.	1.9838172511411212
The incidence amounts to 0.4% among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases.	2.2022762054386256
Concerning this review, the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all 66 patients we operated on between 1961 and 1996.	2.4844713563624556
Preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult.	2.345746350971711
The majority of patients (77%) are male.	2.619572487024194
There is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand.	2.587218943097962
A higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in agriculture, in the building trade, and in paper mills.	2.329388580966523
Pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47% of the patients.	2.6767346869056965
Usually, the tentative diagnosis is based on chest x-ray, especially if hemoptysis is present.	2.590003053016307
Major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma.	2.447237315076213
Clinical presentation and chest x-ray findings are non-characteristic.	2.3803074471920316
Nowadays, the typical x-ray of pulmonary aspergilloma, almost always localized in the upper lobes, became a rare finding.	2.428580690695479
If an aspergillus infection is suspected, serologic methods are reliable and sensitive.	2.1522144978037465
If a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings, clinical examination, and patient's social history, an operation is justified.	2.0733348962522755
Relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the mycotoxins.	2.3644024507580146
The lobectomy, if necessary carried out as pleuro-lobectomy, is the adequate resection in most patients (68%).	2.173870161577291
However, this operation is technically demanding and it usually requires a longer operating time as compared to lobectomies for other underlying diseases.	2.0461583925165736
Peri- and postoperative complications occur in 60% of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma.	2.4666076297723207
A higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections, like segmentectomies or wedge resections, as compared to lobectomies.	2.3085958201075067
Persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem.	2.447283546972793
It requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients.	2.6418168260287747
The operative mortality rate is 3%.	2.4901424401712653
A systemic antifungal therapy is not an appropriate treatment for saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis and can even cause specific complications.	2.1961672022200354
Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common psychic disturbance occurring acutely after various surgical procedures and typically presenting with a fluctuating course.	2.1239727844473695
These patients' recovery takes longer.	2.3943483509992762
In this study we analyze the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing vascular surgery and try to identify risk factors for its development.	2.3723977398763507
Methods: Patients undergoing elective arterial operations were included.	2.291700193639828
Their medical history, the specific vascular diagnosis and operation performed, the medication and laboratory data were monitored.	2.2147108896410774
Additionally the patients were preoperatively interviewed by a psychiatrist.	2.592425970012839
Intraoperatively the drugs, infusions, possible transfusions, blood gases and pressures were monitored, as were the times of surgery and anesthesia.	2.075779862562478
Postoperatively patients were seen daily by the psychiatrist and the surgeon for at least 7 days.	2.1537232792665617
Postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria, and mild, moderate and severe delirium were distinguished.	2.0864207020784873
Results: Fifty-four patients entered the study.	2.4208980869035783
Twenty-one (38.9 %) developed postoperative delirium (11 mild, 2 moderate, 8 severe).	1.9289607435975757
Some preexisting diseases (hearing disturbance) increased the probability of postoperative delirium, while age was not identified as a risk factor.	2.2088224310130626
General psychopathological and depressive disturbances increased the likelihood of postoperative delirium.	2.2737615760265366
Patients who had a severe intraoperative course developed postoperative delirium more frequently.	2.253227035367475
More reliable parameters were an increased intraoperative need for crystalloid volume, intra - or postoperatively decreased hemoglobin values (Hb < 10 g/dl) and the development of acidosis that had to be treated.	2.44303100098421
Patients with delirium had serious complications more often (8/21 = 38.1 % vs 6/33 = 18.2 %) and needed Intensive Care treatment longer (2.7 vs 2.1 days, only aortic surgery 3.2 vs 2.4 days).	1.6901419129296797
Conclusions: Postoperative delirium after vascular surgery is frequent.	2.355394739187254
Patients undergoing aortic surgery, with specific concomittant medical disease, psychopathological disturbances and a severe intraoperative course, are at risk of developing postoperative delirium.	2.064718121511234
This report summarizes our experiences with the subjective visual vertical (SVV) as a clinical neuro-otological tool.	2.1397873439917725
In the SVV test, patients have to orient a dim light bar in an otherwise dark surrounding earth-vertical, using a remote-control.	1.8265900321997652
Normal subjects in an upright position did not deviate more than 2 ° from true vertical.	2.070365055885897
After vestibular neurectomy, the SVV was consistently tilted by some 12 ° toward the affected ear.	1.9842489883952996
Smaller tilts (~7 °) of the SVV occured in patients with spontaneous peripheral vestibular diseases.	2.9699914046499676
This shift in SVV disappeared within weeks to months, similar to the spontaneous nystagmus.	2.1673053089956182
After stapes surgery slight deviations of the SVV towards the unoperated ear were seen in about 20% of the patients, indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs.	2.2448811140579163
Assessed in an upright position, the SVV thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic otolithic input differences between the two ears.	2.3356463847910427
Introduction: Vocal cord paralysis is a important complication in thyroid gland surgery.	2.0672810048761856
A prospective study was conducted ascertain the frequency of laryngeal nerve palsy not caused by surgical trauma.	2.4279546521970112
Patients and Methods: Two hundred and ten patients were investigated laryngoscopically pre- and postoperatively after short-term intubation in the course of operations far removed from thorax or neck region.	2.2188712889413713
We noted the inner diameter of the tube, intubation problems, the qualification of the anaesthesiologist and the positioning of the patient.	2.275989117536588
Results: Preoperatively we found previously unknown unilateral laryngeal nerve palsy in 1.9 % of cases.	2.0643949534100265
Postoperatively there were pathological findings of vocal cords in 13 patients (6.2 %).	2.323129418863588
In 10 patients a direct lesion (oedema, rubor, haematoma, granuloma) was established.	1.9776369624040113
Three patients (1.4 %) were found to have a movement disorder caused by a neural lesion without morphological findings, leading to restitutio ad integrum in two of three cases after 6 months.	2.2206195655645415
Conclusion: The frequency of intubation-related recurrent nerve palsy is 1.4 % transiently and 0.5 % permanently.	2.057538708265985
Preoperative laryngoscopic investigation of vocal cords should be carried out before intubation.	2.401321068553925
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are the most frequent infections cause of genital ulcerations.	2.6549757036479438
Although genital infections by HSV-1 are increasing HSV-2 is dominant in recurrent infections.	2.010268244321667
This study was conducted on a panel of sera collected anonymously in 1996 and 1997 from blood donors (1979 samples) and hospital patients (3079 samples) without risk factors for herpesvirus infections such as STD, other infectious diseases and immunosuppression.	1.788978854555793
Serum samples were tested with ELISAs using monoclonal antibody-selected native gG1 and gG2 as antigens and an immunoblot using type-specific recombinant glycoproteins.	1.7845725780751485
Equivocal results were confirmed with an in-house Western blot.	2.256584635031096
This study investigates the effects of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator, and the lipid peroxidation inhibitor U-101033E on neurological outcome following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.	2.0632016222670266
We report on three family members suffering from both autosomal dominant Hailey-Hailey disease and bipolar affective disorder.	1.8074419521822982
As molecular biology techniques have made the localization of genes causing simple Mendelian traits possible as a routine task, the gene for Hailey-Hailey disease will presumably be localized in the foreseeable future.	1.9109135336836605
The Hailey-Hailey gene and its chromosomal surrounding will then be a region of interest for linkage studies in bipolar affective disorder.	1.8977820122968252
Background: Osteoporotic fractures occur frequently also in men.	2.2722234205213816
Epidemiologic data from Germany indicate that more than 900,000 men are affected by osteoporotic fractures.	1.9765266434206297
Recurrent headaches and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) are the most common pain syndromes in childhood: The prevalence of tension headache amounts to 20-50 %, of migraine to 5-7 % and of RAP to 15-30 %.	2.1495616989753827
In nearly 50 % of children the complaints persist over many years of their life-span.	2.0250402814660284
The unfavourable long-term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions.	2.4181861522096284
Empirical findings on the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology are still very limited.	2.1721853361068124
Actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance, and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences.	2.05137781428869
The behavioral-medicine proceeding bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis.	1.9131036036904316
During the last years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioral pain management programs for children.	2.017033708298752
The aim of our study was to develop noninvasive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with choroidal metastases.	2.2172557287483543
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is standard therapy for urolithiasis.	2.1259441264437315
With comparable technical principles, various lithotripters have been developed and are in routine use.	2.2685211358372315
Renal pelvic stones, calyceal stones, ureteral stones, and other special forms can be treated with varying results.	2.169522342455054
Currently, the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the recurrence of calculi are under discussion.	2.1648957237887454
Whereas the side effects of ESWL are well known, studies comparing ESWL with other endourological procedures are still lacking.	2.159480696197759
Suramin has long been used in the treatment of onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.	2.771307053625202
Recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines.	2.0873095899430716
Ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma.	2.556494811016696
Four of the five developed a papulovesicular or maculopapular rash within 2 - 4 weeks of starting therapy.	2.1456538572324018
The rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within 10 days.	2.264404129924492
In tumour therapy, high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of 200 - 300 µg/ml.	2.234626265027188
Therefore, a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes.	2.1076043431453226
Acetylcholinesterase (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is supposed to be an uncommon cause for oropharyngeal edema.	2.3387230798566514
Between January 1, 1993 and February 1, 1997 we treated 20 patients with edema of the oropharyngeal region that was not caused by infection or irradiation.	2.0838701679211598
The most common reason was an ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema and occurred in 9 cases, all of whom required inpatient treatment.	2.009601906341996
The medical management consisted of the administra- tion of intravenous (i.v.)	2.3078594785784885
glucocorticosteroids in all cases, H1-blockers in 6 cases, epinephrine by inhalation in one case and i.v.	2.3478765839661526
Tracheostomy had to be performed in one patient.	3.6817864601676398
In our experience it is necessary to reconsider ACE inhibitor-induced angioedma in any case of an oropharyngeal edema.	2.293247719338873
However, there is no reason for the routine application of epinephrine in these cases.	2.7593635486380483
There was a disintegration rate of 98 % directly after treatment; 1 week after "Booster technique" treatment 96 % of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms.	2.0929072388473426
The 3-month follow-up showed a stone-free rate of 97 %.	2.5422522406580845
Only in 13 % of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary, 7 % of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and 6 % after ESWL.	2.0704982522061144
43 % of the treatments were performed without any premedication, anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia.	2.2539252277342987
Our data even prove that in situ ESWL is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones.	2.550859764995683
In comparison to endoscopic procedures, it is superior in regard to invasivity, side effects, complications and neccessity of analgesia, while being just as efficient.	2.341185935466115
The perspectives for active hearing implants lie in the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).	2.5119909771119087
The majority of patients with SNHL suffer from a cochlea amplifier (CA) failure which is discernible by a positive recruitment and loss of otoacoustic emissions (OAE).	1.98830254094821
Therefore, the electronic implant is expected to partially replace functions of the CA.	2.1250293295047853
Thus, the implant is thought to function as a CAI (cochlea amplifier implant).	2.184395823448278
An approved implant for routine use is not yet available.	2.5082416338875624
Clinical studies have thus far only used the high energy consuming (HEC), narrow-band, electromagnetic floating-mass transducer, as well as the Maniglia-HEC implant.	1.925022942023591
Of the piezoelectrical implants, a German CAI (Tübingen implant) at present consisting of a piezoelectrical transducer and a microphone has thus far been acutely implanted in first patient.	1.7983349616909863
It is a low energy consuming (LEC), broad-band implantable system for patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	2.1492391919886056
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) was de-scribed electroclinically by Janz and Christian in 1957 and consists of myoclonic jerks in  varying combination with the absence of seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a typical circadian distribution on awakening, sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption and flickering stimuli as characteristic precipitating factors, typical EEG abnormalities with generalized epileptiform discharges, normal physical and neuroradiological findings, and often a family history of epilepsy.	1.7233557551237642
Although the misdiagnosis of this well-classified and easily treatable syndrome is supposed to occur rarely in Germany, we retrospectively investigated how often the wrong initial classification had been made among patients who were finally treated in our outpatient epilepsy unit.	2.0165245502123144
Between 1993 and 1995, 30 patients with a typical JME-like symptom constellation were identified who had been misdiagnosed initially.	2.3955298316641827
In all patients, localization-related epilepsy had been classified, although regional EEG abnormalities were rare (n=5).	1.9286686767225318
All patients reported the typical circadian distribution, abnormal neuroradiological findings were absent, and typical EEG abnormalities were present in all cases.	2.1353300019381374
Under treatment with appropiate antiepileptic drugs 97% of the patients became almost completely seizure-free.	2.4056504171013877
Even 40 years after the first description of the syndrome, JME is an underdiagnosed illness.	2.6859550384055897
The generally  positive course underlines the importance of its correct identification.	2.441521699629835
Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate results of visual acuity and binocularity and complications after cataract surgery with primary capsular bag-fixated IOL implantation in children.	2.0569603974951733
Arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease.	2.6755996321061444
Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the perifoveal microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension.	2.6419821100650234
During follow-up a progression of these alterations has been reported.	2.6622967989171076
The cause of the bleeding should be investigated so as to exclude carcinoma as its origin.	2.2772139879616886
First, the basic circulation parameters should be determined.	2.272312889453897
Blood volume and oxygen substitution are essential.	2.4299508128451803
Depending on these findings, further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken.	2.316779226103692
If the situation is stable, diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor.	2.170960793210523
A general examination, including a vaginal and rectal examination, must be performed.	2.32080611037305
Other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound (vaginal and transabdominal) and CT or MRI may be required.	2.1892927282495664
If available, an angiography should be performed.	2.425390367129935
Medium-term results with a follow-up of at least 3 years were done in 160 patients (average follow up 51 months) after ACL reconstruction using IKDC evaluation form and Noyes score and in 110 patients (average follow Up 53 months) after non-operative management.	2.3751825968532554
Unlike objective good parameters the subjective assessment of knee function according to the Noyes score reveals significantly worse results in cases with ACL reconstruction compared to the knees without surgery.	2.3804768394424585
The best functional results we found in professional athletes after ACL reconstruction.	2.2705591036766823
Comparable positive results of knee function is only achieved in approx.	2.3689871932731714
15 % of the patients from the natural history group, who can maintain high risk pivoting activity level feeling no giving way.	2.3511317239990746
In our opinion compensatory proprioceptive mechanism account for the surpassing results in these two groups of patients.	2.2189227369563307
It will be postulated that it is not the absolute power of the hamstring but the latency period of recruition that influences the compensation of anterior knee instability.	2.106189253477425
We have modified our rehabilitation methods in order to improve proprioception and dynamic stability of the ACL-deficient knee.	2.4853054312785097
Only when menisceal lesions appear or patients suffer from giving way episodes we support secondary surgery.	1.9299639375021385
The pivot shift sign is reflecting the dynamic aspect of knee instability.	2.0755203803402718
In our opinion it is the decisive parameter to assess knee instability unless there are useful technical procederes.	1.9854338954149107
Multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem.	3.0707403434118814
The present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged 65 years or more.	2.3913701896393653
A total of 1154 multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS) of at least 18 points were divided in two age groups: Y: 16 - 64 years, n = 1022; O: 65 - 94 years, n = 132.	2.053616623740484
Older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases (69%), while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers (41%).	2.192099998232955
ISS was comparable in both groups (Y 28 +/- 1, O 27 +/- 1).	2.846333381024916
During ICU-therapy incidence of ARDS (Y 10%, O 11%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF; Y 6%, O 9%) and pneumonia (Y 17%, O 21%) were comparable.	1.9049627952372519
In contrast, septic complications were more frequent in older patients (Y 19%, O 27%).	2.1987784373232993
Mortality was significantly higher in older patients (Y 15%, O 53%).	2.346348842624283
The major cause of death was sepsis in older patients (Y 15%, O 31%) and MOF in younger patients (Y 54%, O 29%).	1.9870575202758678
The Raynaud phenomenon occurs in 90-100% of patients with systemic scleroderma.	2.7566017140283967
It is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between vasocontrictive and vasodilatory influences.	2.18599128441626
Early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances.	2.540501625244824
Structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm.	2.256021289699706
New vasodilatory treatment strategies, e.g.	2.279178249909195
infusions with calcitonin gene-related peptides, could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma.	2.489741517921488
Due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence, strong efforts were made to find non-pharmacological strategies.	2.182291821162024
For three years now, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix from InControl has been available as an alternative therapy.	2.0507527016158327
From October 1995 to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in 179 patients worldwide.	2.215478190031201
The sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90%; the specifity to detect sinus rhythm is 100%.	2.1409049024865645
In 121 of 179 patients, 748 episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with 2.4 shocks per episode.	2.118041710479178
No proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen.	2.298361066624513
A cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95% of patients; the overall clinical success rate was 88%.	2.3608491326538186
In 7% of all patients, early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further cardioversions and antiarrhythmic therapy.	2.3384923960270423
In 4.1% there were lead-related complications, in 4 patients the device had to be explanted because of ineffective therapy, and in 3 patients the device had to be changed because of loss of telemetry or early depletion of battery.	2.2821444673545757
In 8 patients, postoperative complications were seen (infections, pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein).	2.2941608944277694
Overall, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation.	2.2705268871062434
Background: The success rate of combined glaucoma and small incision cataract surgery is not yet established.	2.3577964912545144
The somatosensory system of preterms and newborns differs substantially from adults.	2.007624776694351
Maturation of A- and C-fibre synaptic connections in the dorsal horn and development of descending inhibition from the brainstem all take place postnatally in the rat.	1.9718012950783212
In early stages of development there is no definite spatial sepraration in the dorsal horn between the nociceptive and the non-nociceptive system.	2.2815755827541677
In preterms but not in adults non-noxious stimuli can induce central sensitization.	2.0960404386542497
More important, receptors are frequently transiently overexpressed or expressed in areas during development where they are not seen in the adult and may have a different functional profile.	2.1147960356220112
The descending pain inhibitory system that provides an important protection against central sensitization developes later than the ascending nociceptive system.	1.9195405250280542
Thus, during a critical period of time the immature nociceptive system is highly vulnerable.	2.2904124138646784
For example, neonatal circumcision in the absence of analgesia results in increased pain responses during subsequent routine vaccination months later.	1.990054256142647
Since the attitude of the general public also has an effect on community-based psychiatric care, we must ask how public opinion might be influenced.	2.082448859933953
One possible approach could be through so-called key community leaders - those who are highly respected in society because of their competence in a particular area.	2.0699592789515298
Doctors belong to this group of people.	2.670527355793984
For this reason we questioned medical students, as future key community leaders, with respect to their attitudes toward the mentally ill within the framework of their first contact with psychiatric patients during their studies.	1.942539926914989
In order to make a direct comparison possible, we interviewed a sample of the Mannheim population who live in a part of the city where a variety of complementary facilities have been set up.	2.1386479642256493
The comparison shows that medical students do not have a more positive attitude toward the mentally ill; in fact, in certain areas they have an even more negative attitude toward the mentally ill than the general population has.	1.9899222663015075
We were not able to establish what effect teaching has with respect to changing attitudes.	2.2786703876021996
This requires knowledge of normal lymphatic anatomy and metastatic routes.	2.159134097592082
Systematic lymphadenectomy performed as a standard or as an extended resection is a prerequisite for pathologic tumor staging.	2.3240015919234667
Recommendations as to the extent of lymphadenectomy are derived from potential improvement of prognosis and procedure-related complications.	2.449680918735082
Life threatening hemorrhage in patients with malignant tumours of the head and neck area are often, as a result of tumour infiltration, postoperative anatomical changes, infection and radiological necrosis, difficult to control.	2.4334546992105697
One option for prophylaxis and treatment is the ligature of the external (ECA) or common carotid artery (CCA) and superior thyroid artery (STA).	2.113319308205884
52 patients were examined in a retrospective study to determine both the hazards and the therapeutic use of the procedure.	3.1003450932757732
The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated prophylactically during the operative procedure of tumour resection and neck dissection in 25 patients.	2.246184550189526
In 27 cases closure of the ECA, CCA or ECA and STA was carried out as an emergency procedure for acute hemorrhage following completed primary treatment (operation, primary or postoperative radiation or radiochemotherapy).	1.9827677503868395
There was no postoperative hemorrhage after prophylactic ligature of the ECA.	2.15560352332475
One patient with multiple cardiovascular diseases suffered from an ipsilateral cerebral infarction 1 year after operation.	2.153953720516732
In 6 of 9 patients and in all 3 patients, in whom ligature of the CCA or ECA and STA respectively was carried out as an emergency procedure, severe neurological complications up to an apallic syndrome occured.	2.118208145847277
The number of deaths due to acute hemorrhage was considerably smaller among those patients with prophylactic ligature of the ECA performed during operative procedure of tumor resection and neck dissection.	1.9809420002240692
In addition there were much less unfavourable courses in the sequence of prophylactic closure of the ECA than observed after ligating the CCA or ECA and STA in an emergency situation.	1.8565207321537762
The carcinoid tumor of the middle ear is a very rare neoplasm which in general is regarded as benign but may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma because of its histological heterogeneity.	2.288313379142104
Typical, however, is its neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation so that an unequivocal diagnosis is possible by means of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.	2.455890229404175
As the tumor is very rare, there is no statistical evidence as to whether further treatment is necessary after primary exstirpation of the tumor.	2.520437607486451
Therefore, a review of the literature was performed.	2.545903678135659
We report about a 28-year-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor of the left tympanic cavity.	2.4444515023213236
Without any further treatment there has been no evidence for either recurrence or metastases 32 months after surgical resection.	2.2288076307559086
As treatment of choice we recommend conservative surgery with complete removal of the tumor and a clinical follow-up on a regular basis.	2.904276102742441
Intraoperative precision in computer-assisted surgery depends on the characteristics of a navigation system, the precision of correlation between object and data set, the position, number and fixation of landmarks, and the parameters of the data set.	2.4011014112586127
The characteristics of a navigation system, in particular the immanent precision, can be detected by the use of the geometric model and navigation analyzer developed at the University of Regensburg with the support of Carl Zeiss, Germany.	2.363148074988909
The precision of five navigation systems of different types and technology was measured: Viewing Wand (ISG, mechanical system), the SMN microscope (Carl Zeiss, infrared system with laser autofocus), the MKM system (Carl Zeiss, robot platform with laser autofocus) and the STP pointer (Leibinger, infrared system).	1.9442743231635076
The immanent precision of these systems ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 mm.	2.1882630153463287
An electromagnetic system (3-Space Digitizer, Polhemus) was compared; this produces serious spherical deviations of 10.0 to 20.0 mm in the presence of metal, surgical and rotating instruments, and circuits.	1.9669990594638955
The application of these different systems for craniomaxillofacial surgery is discussed.	2.113348770198853
The aim of the study was to record retrospectively the events of Pneumocystis carinii-Pneumonia (PCP) among HIV-infected children (<18 years) in Germany.	2.0370720075414837
The patients were evaluated with regard to prophylaxis, course of disease and prognosis.	3.0280152586628333
In this study we looked at the relationship between extracorporal circulation and changes in blood electrolytes.	2.2806767994956116
Glucocorticoids are a potent cause of osteoporosis and thus a potential source of substantial morbidity in patients who are already significantly disabled by their underlying condition.	2.1284361108016085
These agent interact with calcium metabolism at many levels; in particular they reduce the osteoblast's synthesis of the principal proteins of bone matrix.	1.8771727217391077
They also reduce circulating sex hormone concentrations, particularly in men and postmenopausal women.	2.152701345955649
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract, have not yet been fully investigated.	2.2842241928189453
Although good progress has been made in their diagnosis, classification of these lesions with regard to their histogenesis and biological behavior remains problematic.	2.2840293031199104
Between 1994 and 1998, 18 GIST patients underwere operation in the Department of Surgery.	2.313081663396275
Twelve of these patients (67 %) had stromal tumors in the stomach, and six (33 %) had intestinal stromal tumors.	2.3348032364776494
The primary tumor could be removed in all patients with R0 resection.	2.844290917541226
Six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis, with the size of their primary tumor exceeding 10 cm.	2.2925531329227193
Extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case.	2.718435935329639
Lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur.	2.5274238542731515
Histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of Lewin, Weinstein and Riddell.	2.266278125747764
Currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases.	2.843470037079346
We report the case of a 39-year-old sewerage worker, who was admitted to our hospital with fever, jaundice, pain in his calves and acute renal failure.	2.118377368914224
Serology revealed elevated antibody titers against Leptospira canicola, L. icterhaemorrhagica and L. sejroe.	1.9091517506932216
The patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.	1.9548875082293389
The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm.	2.183481454446573
Cardiac arrest developed, most likely due to hypoxia, with a drop in the blood pressure.	2.643347082165329
Despite immediate resuscitation efforts the patient developed severe hypoxic brain damage and died a few days later.	2.277341050486378
Autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized leptospiral infection, signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient.	2.0273179793694878
The virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic tracheitis and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue.	1.7915714637046478
A medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given, the disease being recognized as an occupational disease.	1.9676605730561867
During the past decade, the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become better understood.	2.043295813124541
Each of these steps is crucial and limiting, since a failure to complete any one prevents the tumor cell from producing a metastasis.	1.8654471048768997
Detachment from the solid tumor by loosening the intercellular junctions and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix enables tumor cells to enter blood- and lymph vessels.	1.9079152133170851
The intravasation into the circulation is supported by the secretion of angiogenic factors, which induce degradation of the basal membran in blood vessels.	2.097065870724396
Adhesion to endothelial cells, extravasation from the circulation, and induction of angiogenesis are further essential steps for completing the metastatic process.	1.96739875761279
Furthermore, it is well known that once a tumor cell has entered circulation, it will survive only by evasion of the immune system.	2.1504542844833705
The systematic identification of tumor antigens opens up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic approaches.	2.0199151773583206
Hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male.	2.369158300845154
The choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible.	2.230165597111652
Future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate.	2.0621099149344846
Any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely, especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate.	2.3859264034634995
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a disease that involves the lining of joints, bursae and tendon sheaths.	2.0925261866495166
The incidence is low and estimated to be 1.8 patients per million population.	2.1533748782754314
The cause of PVNS is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic.	1.9897927761556866
PVNS has been described in 2 forms different for prognosis and treatment (nodular and diffuse).	2.2733350848625586
The articular form almost appeares in the knee joint as we describe below in a 14 year-old patient.	2.3460235949497648
In this retrospective study, 13 patients with subtle Lisfranc joint injuries were examined after a mean period of 23 months using clinical assessment, radiography and dynamic pedographic gait analysis.	1.914864486008717
The aims were to identify the factors leading to a mobile flatfoot deformity, evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of these injuries, and draw practical conclusions for initial management and subsequent intervention.	2.0146224419268077
All patients showed a mobile flatfoot deformity, increased motion in the subtalar joint, increased load on the hindfoot, decreased load on the forefoot, and a prolonged contact phase during the stance phase.	2.085772734520907
Radiographs revealed progressive osteoarthrosis in the joint and a residual displacement of the medial Lisfranc joint.	2.455481072374208
An unstable medial Lisfranc joint results in the development of a mobile flatfoot.	3.01429663990479
Initial treatment of a subtly displaced Lisfranc joint should consist of exact anatomical reduction and additional maintenance of the longitudinal arch of the foot.	2.053319998482067
After failed initial treatment, early arthrodesis of the midfoot is recommended as a salvage procedure for the foot.	2.1878837999695415
Cross-sectional imaging with CT and MRI plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic workup and staging of laryngeal neoplasms.	1.9676505954759402
Adequate interpretation of the CT and MR images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and familiarity with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality.	2.131716618769691
Both CT and MR imaging are highly sensitive for the detection of neoplastic invasion of the pre-epiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottic region and cartilage.	2.2440777579692592
The high negative predictive value of both CT and MRI allows exclusion of neoplastic cartilage invasion quite reliably.	2.2508555834863175
The specificity of both CT and MRI is, however, limited and both methods may therefore overestimate the extent of tumor spread.	2.4984510103212476
Nevertheless, both cross-sectional imaging methods significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy.	2.2798774221174463
In the presence of a submucosal mass, CT and MRI play a key role for the diagnosis, as they may characterize the lesion, reliably depict its submucosal extent, and guide the endoscopist to perform deep biopsies that allow a definitive histological diagnosis.	2.0671242697880325
Background: HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.	2.247478905217205
Organ culture storage leads to loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.	2.0160276844482916
This study investigates the importance of prolonged storage period for the success rate after penetrating keratoplasty.	2.535272901266354
Ergotamine-containing drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.	2.680915636215104
Among others, spastic vasoconstrictions are one of the possible side effects usually affecting the lower extremities and sometimes leading to gangrene.	2.278101654460375
The case of a 75 year old woman is presented who was suffering from migraine-attacks since adolescence.	2.2514274088529413
Due to longterm use of ergotamine containing suppositories she developed perianal ulcers.	1.9727448396956633
After withdrawl of the drug the ulcers healed up entirely.	2.426969745924088
The spectrum of ergotamine-induced side-effects and possible intervention strategies are discussed.	2.226785102675072
In this article, a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed, which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians.	2.2351407215226637
This model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help.	2.708501344102832
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance has three elements: (1.)	1.908699352908595
a QA-Inventory for routine monitoring; (2.)	2.268338955078272
rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and (3.)	2.9884066107048612
a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists (quality circles).	2.142742153908624
The focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results.	2.392547714623762
It is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles, where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed.	2.307471777178314
This feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients.	2.252292939993224
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of Quality Assurance, which is aimed at assuring and improving the quality and rationality of the psychotherapeutic service.	2.1891652992449306
Aims: In this study the technique of intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) was evaluated as an experimental tool to differentiate peripheral and central effects of analgesics.	2.275864855629237
A pre-term infant weighing 900 g, gestational age 25 weeks, developed an acute abdomen.	2.087302656984886
Intravenous lines had been inserted previously in the left (silasticcatheter) and right (24 G cannula) saphenous veins in the neonatal intensive care unit.	1.9939300526309565
During surgical exploration, a perforation of the terminal ileum was found.	2.2743057938458824
The operation consisted in partial resection of the perforated ileum with an end-to-end anastomosis and a double-lumen colostomy.	2.179750218974473
Major blood loss during the procedure caused serious haemodynamic problems.	2.375141648825541
Despite transfusion of erythrocyte (100 ml), thrombocytes (75 ml), and albumin (50 ml), the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension.	2.7642986705282113
Administration of atropine, adrenaline, and calcium IV had no effect.	2.0610881204226796
The operation could be finished only with extrathoracic resuscitation.	2.126106671138284
When the drapes were removed, livid, swollen lower limbs raised the suspicion of an acute thrombosis of the inferior vena cava.	2.1363341480006275
After insertion of a 24 G IV cannula into a vein of the right upper arm, the circulation stabilised after rapid transfusion of 40 ml blood and 25 ml thrombocytes and resuscitation was successful.	1.956733438534556
Paediatricians and anaesthesiologists must consider the risk of thrombosis of the vena cava.	2.8698330129603553
If venous lines in the lower limbs are not visible to the anaesthesiologist during the operation, venipuncture of veins of an upper limb is recommended before starting the surgical procedure.	2.2015240899614534
Due to the high incidence of vena cava thrombosis caused by central venous lines and the difficulty of peripheral venipuncture in pre-termintanty, a safe venous line should be inserted if necessary by pre-operative venesection.	1.8931743045503102
While complementary medicine and homeopathy is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the health care practices, there is a lack of controlled studies concerning their effectiveness.	2.4226924033038677
In our study, we wanted to answer the question whether a combination of Formica rufa D6 and reinjection of the patient's own blood is superior to injection of placebo.	2.2402512141590774
104 patients with ankylosing spondylitis entered a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.	2.2370592749458567
During four weeks they received twice weekly either 1 ml of Formica rufa D6 in combination with 0.5 ml of blood or 1.5 ml NaCl intramuscular.	2.002298913899839
Before and after therapy, mobility, thoracic excursion and doctor's overall assessment were measured in addition to patient's health status, using a German version of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales, before and after therapy as well as four, twelve, and twentyfour weeks later.	2.1755858790100224
We were not able to detect any statistical difference between treatment and placebo group in any of the parameters measured.	2.2555039664166268
Therefore, the therapy under study may not be regarded effective.	2.297778401521527
A 32-year-old man was accused of attempted rape.	2.453349544478291
While urinating at the side of the road he felt an erection.	2.2236799305166026
He approached a 9-year-old girl who happened to be coming along and pressed his penis between her legs until ejaculation.	1.9659175760382483
Shortly afterwards he was arrested.	2.5270327746618126
He confessed, but claimed partial amnesia and had no explanation for the offence, which he normally would never have thought of.	1.9321581322147285
Shortly before the event a witness had seen him nearby in a poor state of orientation.	1.9744089204664084
Three months later in prison he suffered massive subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.	2.26297255288508
The evaluation of his legal responsibility must take account of a putative psychomotor seizure at the time of the offence.	2.124568991945173
With regard to the aneurysm diagnosed later, a pathogenetic connection, in terms of a preceding warning leak, might be assumed.	2.1543387406638765
We present a 43-year-old patient who has had up to 15 frontal lobe seizures nightly for 12 years.	2.079779049132178
The patient had no complaints apart from excessive daytime sleepiness.	2.1018219759478
Neurological and psychiatric examination as well as cerebral computed tomograph and magnetic resonance imaging were normal.	2.7955150464342435
After sleep deprivation an interictal electro-encephalogram demonstrated a recurrent excess of theta activity over the right frontal and frontopolar area.	1.7973859545683806
A cerebral PET study showed diminished glucose metabolism of the right cingular and frontomesial region.	2.2586832438628086
The sleep structure was extremely fragmented.	2.3706228162232588
There was an excessive reduction of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep.	2.019615570980949
Carbamazepine therapy produced complete seizure control lasting a few weeks, followed by return of up to 8 seizures per night.	2.2505348278855455
Vigabatrin as add on therapy diminished the noctural seizures to 1 to 3 per night.	2.0072806151963096
Introduction: We attempted to optimize the determination of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation in VLBW infants for practical use in a tertiary care center.	2.006586477384612
The influence of measuring conditions upon results as well as of caloric intake and food composition on substrate utilisation and growth were investigated.	2.0854003740173237
We report a truck driver with severe soft tissue contusion of both legs who developed atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) after a thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin; despite a thrombosis the patient showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin in combination with elevation of thrombocytes and positive heparin-dependent antibodies.	1.8842023164680255
Six days after the initial trauma deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and fasciotomy was performed, preventing an imminent compartment syndrome.	2.534205762281677
Another 5 days later the patient developed exanthema of the trunk and upper extremities and urticaria on his face, as well as severe headache.	2.4746707407626
His platelet count increased from 134 000/µl to 258 000/µl.	2.010775177586042
After exclusion of other causes for these symptoms, a reaction to heparin-dependent antibodies (heparin-platelet-factor 4 complex) was demonstrated 2 days later.	2.0662648261122234
Shortly after rinsing of an intravenous line with less than 50 IE unfractionated heparin at day 36 after trauma the patient developed an anaphylactic shock, which could be managed with cortisone.	1.999756477423829
We suggest that in HIT the thrombocytopenia may represent only one form of an allergic reaction to heparin.	2.0876526449201314
The cause of the thrombembolic event is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin taking place on the surface of the thrombocyte.	2.1314519775566376
This is similar in all forms of systemic reaction to heparin application, even though the symptoms may vary.	2.241348421889816
As thrombocytopenia may not be the main symptom of a heparin-induced antibody reaction - in our hospital only 5 of 10 patients with HIT - the disease should rather be named "heparin allergy".	2.1464928715158904
We suggest a new classification of different pattern of heparin allergy types I-IV.	2.202787623669647
The new types I and II are similar to HIT types I and II.	2.23093586519745
Type III is the reaction of antibodies without decrease of thrombocytes, and type IV the reaction of antibodies associated with systemic allergic symptoms.	1.9190491843313082
In recent years, lengthening the human mandible by distraction osteogenesis has become an accepted treatment to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia.	1.9594228378547813
Using intraoral unidirectional and extraoral bidirectional distraction devices we report about our experiences and results in the application of the bone distraction technique in four selected cases of syndromal disease, including various forms of mandibular hypoplastic malformations.	2.2348287344558697
The patients involved were a boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, a girl with unilateral facial hypoplasia in Goldenhar's syndrome, a case with Nager's syndrome, and a rare case of midline deficiency caused by partial deletion of chromosome 18 (18p-syndrome).	1.9761265746775725
The distraction period lasted from 6 to 30 days and new bone formation, ranging from 6 to 28 mm, was achieved.	2.2079489753793657
Real leg length discrepancies may be cosmetically disturbing and lead to gait abnormalities, pelvic obliquity with subsequent lumbar scoliosis as well as functional disturbances of hip, knee and ankle joint.	2.1344972289121453
Morbidity and mortality after reversal of Hartmann's procedure following perforated sigmoid diverticulitis are high and the rate of intestinal restoration is low.	2.0807300680736796
Aim: To investigate whether laparoscopically assisted reversal of Hartmann's procedure is technically feasible and whether the laparoscopic procedure offers any benefit to the patient.	1.982021825719817
All patients were reinvestigated 9 months after surgery.	2.310414428767327
Results: Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure was attempted in 19 patients.	2.306204163422468
One patient did not want the laparoscopic technique.	2.3383157640423082
In two cases (11 %) conversion to the conventional technique was necessary; thus, 16 patients were operated laparoscopically.	2.315630418270832
Median operative time was 114 (65-180) min.	2.3367865184292205
With the exception of three wound infections no immediate postoperative complications were noticed.	2.063151127105202
Patients' convalescence was fast.	2.4425930727711123
First evacuation took place 3.3 (3-5) days after surgery, complete oral nutrition 3.6 (3-5) days after surgery.	2.357036604983662
Duration of postoperative hospitalisation was 7.5 (5-12) days.	2.5956895681922703
One patient developed later a clinically significant anastomotic stricture which needed endoscopic dilatation.	1.9511844458278977
Conclusion: Laparoscopically assisted Hartmann's reversal is technically demanding but feasible.	2.1714995691663197
Postoperative morbidity is low, duration of hospitalisation short, convalescence fast.	2.3122286743597815
Thus, good arguments exist for performing reversal of Hartmann's procedures laparoscopically.	2.129080059389967
Mechanical ventilation is a well-etablished strategy in intensive care medicine.	2.373094742209796
ICU trauma patients require analgesia, and sedation mostly consists of benzodiazepines and opioids with increasing doses over time.	2.044328298483965
The weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome, showing tachycardia, hypertonia, tachypnea and restlessness.	2.0096048826678836
Adding sufentanil, an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl, tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency.	2.0546688279721597
In this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both, the patient and physician.	2.656796329705666
In comparison with a group of 50 patients treated with clonidine alone, 72 patients treated with clonidine/sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation (4.8 vs 7.6 days) and until discharge from the ICU (7.7 vs 12.4 days).	1.9608362672442952
The number of reintubations caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from 16.0 to 2.8 %.	1.8976569790312547
Background: With regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues, microsurgical techniques, HLA typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection, and postoperative treatment schedules have been improved in recent years.	1.871480752595536
This now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed.	2.0574797706622943
However, in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear.	2.134777271424139
The occurrence of a new influenza virus subtype in 1997 in Hongkong caused only minor outbreaks due to the swift and determined actions of the institutions involved.	2.0463869963117367
However, this incident again made it clear that an influenza pandemic is still a pending threat.	2.0207076456159694
As a result the WHO presented a pandemic preparedness plan which is to facilitate the global measures taken to fight an imminent or ongoing pandemic.	1.804275474812973
Strong efforts of influenza surveillance and the coordination of worldwide measures are essential to this plan.	2.068243072830304
Furthermore the WHO suggested the developement and introduction of similar national preparedness plans.	1.9897253270877249
Given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock, immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy.	2.1737046832015077
Many agents have been studied that have the therapeutic potential to interfere with cytokines and other pathways which are activated during sepsis.	2.010370870665997
Drugs having the properties to neutralize lipopolysaccharides have also been considered.	2.2218092400756784
So far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents (HA1A, E5, anti TNF antibodies, ILra) have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit.	2.078516290430688
In certain trials results were indecisive, or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies.	1.987122000772758
In certain other trials, like those on antibodies against TNF, some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients.	2.0816330864662382
Thus, new trials are on their ways.	2.3203469439871243
So far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re-examine the concept of immunomodulation, and to redefine strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host, while not putting him at risk.	2.0346702024558962
Recently, percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) has become more frequent, since the technique can be mastered relatively easily.	2.2671948761294995
Our study seeks to evaluate PDT in terms of its effectivness and practicality on a cardio-surgical ICU.	2.0126681046713237
Recently, two new halogenated volatile anaesthetics, sevoflurane and desflurane, have been approved for clinical use in Germany.	2.254541424225693
Their low solubility in blood is the most important common property, and this represents the most obvious difference from the inhalational anaesthetics currently used.	2.2941813518882763
Extensive clinical and experimental evaluations have confirmed the superior pharmacokinetic properties predicted.	2.1950714154878637
Both sevoflurane and desflurane provide more rapid emergence from anaesthesia, permit easier titration of the anaesthetic dose during maintenance and offer more rapid recovery from anaesthesia.	1.8163199826849727
For sevoflurane, there are additional advantages: a pleasant odor, negligible airway irritation, and excellent pharmacodynamic characteristics that even provide cardiovascular stability comparable to isoflurane.	1.9056684292795392
A certain disadvantage and source of potential nephrotoxicity result from the metabolism of sevoflurane (2-5%) to anorganic fluoride and degradation to compound A in carbon dioxide absorbents.	1.9620026159747108
The extensive clinical data reported to date have revealed no evidence that sevoflurane has adverse renal effects.	2.2127695856696934
New insight into the pathomechanism of nephrotoxicity associated with either production of fluoride or compound A may well support clinical experience.	1.8851910450804392
Desflurane strongly resists in vivo metabolism and because of this it appears to be devoid of toxicity.	2.273687071295918
Nevertheless, potential side-effects may result from degradation in dry absorbents and subsequent release of CO, from its extreme pungency and irritating airway effects.	1.9156193552347316
Thus, desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia, especially in children.	2.829621238995487
The tendency for desflurane transiently to stimulate sympathetic activity, especially at concentrations above 1.0 MAC, limits its application in patients with cardiac disease.	2.1795731446485873
The doctor in charge, who is generally the medical director, is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational faults within his or her department.	1.9027994461107505
Even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible - that is to say the medical director - to be liable.	1.9458464100586297
For this reason, the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training.	2.0904371758588223
Every training measure must guarantee specialist standards; this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist.	2.0253687699785585
A legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times.	2.5869614513169745
Operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist; otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization.	1.9999595581640737
Because of staff shortages it often happens that inexperienced beginners - often doctors doing their practical training - are on call very early on.	1.733655395502296
In the high-risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times.	1.9639619046467398
The changeover from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are rested and that adequate free time is guaranteed.	1.8530706150606804
There must be no friction when cooperation with other disciplines concerned is needed.	2.0728066282203668
Each sector must know its own area of responsibility.	2.190289720758302
The doctor in charge is resonsible for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment.	2.243946251815103
Uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his/her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects.	2.0292757499459113
Georg Friedrich Stromeyer (1804- 1876) is generally known as one of the founders of orthopedics and orthopedic surgery and also made many contributions to modern military medicine.	1.9343171272287212
Furthermore, every oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Germany knows him because of the "Stromeyer hook", which is used for elevation of zygomatic arch fractures.	2.38145188717082
This special aspect as well as Stromeyer's biography is presented in this article from the history of medicine.	2.611990629153941
Changes in clinical presentation of Crohn's disease (CD), patients' age at the time of disease manifestation and operation, general condition and duration of medical management were investigated in a retrospective study.	2.323378560616994
395 operations for CD were divided into consecutive groups and analysed.	2.318252746597539
In an increasing number of cases patients presented with the "fibrostenotic type" rather than the "fistulizing type" of complaints.	2.363722234993612
The duration of disease and of medical management increased.	2.5964329021640262
Patients in later groups were younger and in better general condition.	2.130433110060745
We found a rise in frequency of patients with recurrent CD or prior abdominal surgery for other reasons.	2.3353307414222257
The average total length of the resected intestine could be significantly reduced.	2.4485922840933614
The complication rate was equal in elective and emergency surgery.	2.0916946677174884
Even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity.	2.2711539317233935
Etiologically, numerous factors must be taken into account, the most significant one being arteriosclerosis.	2.518808058889013
The clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous.	2.2749367445275066
CT and, above all, intra-arterial DSA allow for a diagnosis.	2.3321908888519784
A generous consideration of indicating operative intervention, even in asymptomatic patients, is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture.	2.301692822354334
The preferrable therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or endovascularly by embolization.	2.0706897926320806
In the future a treatment with coated stents (TPEG) would also seem possible.	2.006130683920623
Special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation.	1.9943557736834328
We report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion.	2.1886734298889228
Background: Clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamylphosphate-synthetase (4), argininosuccinate-synthetase (2) and argininosuccinate-lyase (2) ) are described.	2.247955046798306
Methods/Therapy: Emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i. v. as well as peritoneal dialysis and/or modified hemodialysis.	2.4496936478251197
Results: Within 72 hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed, leading to developmental retardation later in life.	2.0174405082248943
Four patients died between 2 weeks and 4 years of age.	2.4034152616817095
During follow-up, all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively.	2.4164018924783845
Phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side-effects than benzoate, branched-chain amino acids had favourable effects.	2.014780193138329
One patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development.	2.481078659930184
Conclusions: Neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder.	1.9479236700640705
Specific therapy as described can be life-saving, although most children exhibit marked developmental delay.	2.036441477407418
Sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side-effects than sodium benzoate.	2.432646478416197
Therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications.	2.3840859654099917
Pronounced osteoporosis of and surrounding the acetabulum commonly leads to early loosening of endoprosthetic hip replacements following implantation.	1.9163652861540776
Large osseous defects in the subimplant bed are the result and the reason why multiple revisions of loosened acetabular cups have to be performed so often in rheumatic surgery.	2.088825150964646
The defects extend from the cranial to the central; ventral and dorsal anchorage losses may occur in addition to this.	2.330191933175316
The anchorage of a new implant must be adapted to the individual circumstances.	2.608305608071625
The new implant must be selected in accordance with point of surgical access, the patient's general status and osseous regenerationability.	2.1616578973636438
In the optimum case, osseous buildup of lost anatomical structures is the preferred method.	1.968904729098258
If this is not possible, special implants, mostly custom-made prostheses, have to be incorporated.	2.5969126087108596
However, the survival time of the implants is much shorter than in patients with degenerative diseases.	3.066244193542979
The aim of this study was a long-term follow-up of these patients.	2.5917763709051918
They suffered from different stages of PMD type Erb (n=4), Becker-Kiener (n=4), Duchenne (n=2) and Landouzy-Déjerine (n=2).	2.0654621140311953
At the beginning of the study all patients underwent an invasive electrophysiologic study (EPS).	2.380187358427391
The follow-up of 5.5 yrs included regular clinical visits, ECGs, and Holter recordings (every 3 months) as well as an echocardiography every 6 months.	2.1165292933314466
In 4 patients the EPS revealed a hidden interatrial conduction disturbance (AHRS-ACS 120 +/- 18ms), and in 10 pts an infrahisian conduction disturbance was found (HV max.	2.0326869442616204
Conduction defects were seen independently from the type of PMD and the stage of the disease.	2.3367855676416243
During the follow-up the initially hidden interatrial conduction disturbance became evident in the surface ECG in 2 of 4 pts.	2.237453901996294
One of them developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.	2.3880430772875343
Five of 10 pts with an initially hidden infrahisian conduction disturbance developed an AV block grade I-III and in one case additionally a bundle branch block.	2.121021798253041
Four of these pts - whose PMD showed progression or who developed congestive cardiomyopathy - needed pacemaker implantation because of a first-degree AV block + bifascicular bundle branch block (n=1), a Mobitz II second-degree AV block (n=1) or a third-degree AV block (n=2).	2.0320367879921224
None of the pts with normal findings at the EPS showed abnormal p-waves, an AV block, or an intraventricular conduction disturbance during the follow-up.	1.8782963333731348
We conclude that intracardiac conduction disturbances, especially infrahisian defects including high-degree AV blocks, are a common finding in pts with PMD.	2.0158227159726088
Therefore a regular cardiological screening including an ECG and a Holter recording is reasonable in these patients.	1.941668457842022
Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core temperature below 35 °C and is caused by exposure to cold, drugs, endocrine dysfunction, central nervous system disorders, skin disorders, and trauma.	2.0617718953655935
Depending on the degree of hypothermia, there is a progressive depression of metabolism in each organ system with specific alterations.	2.306544690618244
Bone is among the most common sites of metastatic disease in cancers of the breast, prostate, and lung.	2.4409286154429934
The decision about systemic therapy depends on the histology, presence and extent of extraskeletal disease, and the performance status of the patient.	2.6555306996069756
For patients with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer or prostate cancer, hormonal treatment represents the treatment of choice.	2.163012179642371
In estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, and for patients who have failed hormonal therapy or have liver metastases, chemotherapy should be initiated.	2.387413272299514
All patients with small-cell lung cancer should receive chemotherapy.	2.248235361418798
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers can be treated with radioisotopes.	2.498057577934824
In non-small-cell lung cancer or renal cell cancer, systemic chemotherapy should be confined to younger patients and patients in good general condition.	2.117635167952519
Radiologic assessment of responses of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult.	2.3846590228321425
New approaches in measuring bone metabolites in urine might prove helpful.	2.169980327077886
Although most prenatally diagnosed anatomic malformations are best managed after birth, we can presently offer prenatal therapy to an increasing number of fetuses with simple anatomical defects that have predictably devastating developmental consequences.	1.8389291823392688
A condition amenable to prenatal intervention must fulfill a number of conditions.	2.324735703183571
It must be severe enough to warrant the risks associated with in utero treatment and must be reliably detectable before birth.	1.9730741412452844
Furthermore, the pathophysiology must be reversible by fetal intervention, significantly improving the prognosis over postnatal treatment.	1.8880401699327152
Current indication for prenatal intervention include decompression for obstructive uropathy, temporary tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and tumor debulking for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung and sacrococcygeal teratoma.	1.8894766707786774
Prenatal repair of myelomeningocele is currently being developed but remains controversial since this is not a lethal malformation.	2.2618624379417174
Maternal safety remains paramount in considering fetal intervention.	2.1928615950221477
The main associated risks are pre-term labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes.	2.037314187939148
To reduce maternal morbidity and the risk of prematurity, minimally invasive fetoscopic techniques were developed and are increasingly employed.	2.3528392342368423
These developments will in all probability reduce the importance of open fetal surgery in the future.	2.4580074855384355
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become an important cause of severe infection in hospitalized patients all over the world.	2.199146337159699
In Germany a significant increase of nosocomial infections due to MRSA has occurred during the last 10 years.	2.383794696217859
Especially elderly patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of becoming colonized or infected with MRSA.	2.488751027011501
This report focuses on epidemiology and therapy of MRSA, and on the recommendations concerning management and prevention of spread of MRSA in hospitals and nursing homes.	2.199487425954787
During general anaesthesia gas climate significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques.	2.0817017304152365
Gas climatisation, however, markedly also will be influenced by the temperature loss at, and corresponding water condensation within the hoses, factors which are related to the technical design and material of the patient hose system.	2.3090149050220647
2. to investigate, whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used, proven beforehand to optimally warming and humidifying the anaesthetic gases.	1.7760748942532048
Introduction: Undifferentiated, embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver, the incidence of which is highest in children between 6 and 10 years of age (14.1 %).	2.6741614013495876
Among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia.	2.016318362809443
Embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults.	2.417905733752311
To our knowledge, only 18 cases have been published in the last 50 years.	2.7033459879111708
Methods and results: We now present the case of a 29-year-old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma.	2.512912048817269
Conclusion: This case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver.	2.6402693939274395
The management of this case comprised primary tamponade, interventional embolisation of the feeding artery, and secondary resection under stable conditions.	2.0491989396553363
Substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders, which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy.	2.83058281757861
However reasons are discussed, why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients.	2.221216772473632
Insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency, structural problems, expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in healthprofessionals' perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves.	1.8871321326702506
Though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes exhausting, the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing.	1.9277237194328414
Diagnosis nowadays is based on the distinction between drug depencency and drug abuse on the one hand and substance induced disorders on the other hand.	2.3378082719521394
Readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients.	2.2487962346168127
Therapeutic approaches to deal with this promising aspect of psychotherapy are presented.	2.1863938236658176
They are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude.	2.5367535364064513
They can be easily implemented in different settings.	2.3895072845951706
At the end of the first part of this review in- patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined.	2.6838357220860636
This will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches.	2.281575157082077
The following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability.	2.357548743959739
A model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis.	2.3017478435406553
The concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive.	2.126885719981134
Four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO), our preferred method of treatment of unstable Colles fracture.	2.227763602066402
Biocompatible osteosynthesis was achieved with an invasivity and stability comparable to that of KWO.	2.4100151359208137
In conclusion, injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects.	1.998978756855029
The "pain in the lower limbs" (growing pain) represent one of the most frequent complaint pictures in the child orthopaedic consulting hour.	2.2872320998224267
The delimitation compared to other diseases is difficult and laborious on account of many differential diagnoses.	2.147919932271847
Destination of our investigations was it to set up a standardized investigation diagram with recording all differential diagnoses.	1.9368594434839457
In psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the 'talking cure' because they tend to act instead of verbalizing their experiences interactive entanglements are rather common.	1.8587540060777386
Often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat.	1.9386096949430796
The symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then.	2.1271939725948403
Gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of 'body language' suggests.	1.9140020062188026
Instead as permanent concomitant of utterances it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist.	2.058585562085486
The surgical treatment of varicous veins demands complete exclusion of the primary recirculation circuit.	2.3716134207670145
The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms, on i.e.	2.45800981953693
If there is saphenous vein agreement between them, phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation.	1.9503239717054994
The prospective comparative examination of non-invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12% of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3% for the small with a correction of the operative procedure.	2.289146670627895
In 10 cases of incomplete trunk varicosis, only one diagnosis was correct with non-invasive measures.	2.433453109802974
This leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms.	2.6400378124234574
Undislocated odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x-rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability.	2.342613691715994
In this aspect the classification based on Anderson and D'Alonzo takes a high risk to missunderstood the fracture stability and can results in a secondary fracture dislocation.	2.0241163202364247
Therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism.	2.2570532671587094
In this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction.	2.1474765307930657
Furthermore a better classification of densfractures will be recommended.	2.2366055344031377
In a period of 4 years between March 1994 and March 1998, 143 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery.	2.0650130473979793
According to manometric studies 76 patients had a short-floppy Nissen fundoplication, patients with impaired motility or paraesophageal hernias received a hemifundoplication (Toupet = 42, Dor/Thal = 25).	1.9489089112754476
Recurrent reflux symptoms appeared in 6,3 % after mean 16,7 months follow-up (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 24 %, P < 0.01).	1.9528467978572133
Persistent dysphagia with reoperation occurred in 2.1 % (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 0 %, n. s.).	1.682710260212914
The assessment of Visick's score at the latest control showed the following: Visick I = 63.6 %, Visick II = 30.1 %, Visick III = 6.3 %, Visick IV = 0 %.	1.7277093656069218
The outcome of the operation was rated "excellent" or "good" by 91.6 % of the patients.	2.569409325399256
In contrast to auditory brainstem potentials (ABR), a more apically defined generation of middle latency evoked potentials (MLR) can be assumed due to the longer integration time present.	2.332124544569335
To date, the effect of stimulus frequency spectra on MLR has not been completely known.	2.3364020290832967
By using masking with high-pass filtered white noise in 12 normal-hearing adults, we measured the dependence of amplitude and latency of ABR and MLR on filter frequency.	1.827595906190278
No differences were found between the masking effects for ABR and MLR evoked by tone bursts of 0.5 and 2 kHz.	1.9527721979477919
The high-pass masking of click stimuli showed a greater influence on the amplitude and latency of the ABR than on MLR.	2.1124278824772382
These different qualities have to be considered clinically when evaluating the methods and results of hearing testing with acoustic evoked potentials.	2.2890321652994055
Our findings show that MLR evoked by tone bursts should be used for the frequency selective diagnosis of hearing thresholds, especially in low- frequency ranges.	2.3856328819626436
Objectives: To clarify the incidence of sudden arrythmic death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx).	2.305727132215905
Background: Some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long-term success of the operation.	2.513082517440166
Incidence, underlying risk factors, etiologies, and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined.	2.1279110532989036
Methods: Retrospective analysis of our cohort of 120 cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of 142HTx patients of the years 1984-1999.	2.1611838219005723
Clinical events (death, mode of death, Re-HTx, resuscitation) were noted and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and related to the patients' characteristics by multivariate analysis.	2.11483998375469
Sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or unwittnessed death.	2.186437807696107
Clinical and postmortem findings (autopsies are available in 12/18 sudden death patients) were correlated to the mode of death.	2.187235313937107
Results: During a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 +/- 3.5 years, 45 patients died (38%).	2.433217942995395
The mode of death was non-sudden in 27 inpatients.	2.387640058438923
18 deaths were sudden, 14 of these out of hospital.	2.2694938455303912
In addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations, one of those patients died three month later suddenly, giving a number of a total of 21 cardiac arrests in 20HTx patients.	2.1210247492662706
The actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20% after 6 and 40% after 12 years.	2.1898899004221097
Based on postmortem analysis the etiologies of the events were attributed to transplant vasculopathy in 15 patients, rejection in 5 patients (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade >3A), and to unknown reasons in one.	2.0492731443146788
All three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented bradycardic events (2xtotal AV block, 1xsinus arrest).	1.822794186841083
Pacemakers were implanted in these patients.	2.6657449461281573
Significantly more HTx patients dying suddenly are smokers, had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and worse hemodynamics.	1.9781273747196528
QRS width and PR interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest.	2.42822839821837
In three cases, a decrease in heart rate variability, the occurence of sustained VT, and ST segment depressions prior to the cardiac arrest could be demonstrated.	2.300211940289183
Conclusions: Sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after HTx.	2.2398112737423137
As HTx patient numbers are rising constantly, sudden cardiac death in this population will represent a significant problem.	2.1866826255340546
In our patients about 75% of the arrests can be attributed to graft-vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection.	2.022324458934665
Diagnostic strategies have to be developed to detect patients at risk.	2.8365255489380776
Interestingly, some events may be caused from bradyarrhythmic rhythm disturbances.	2.2680987538467816
Introduction: Traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee.	2.9420277154569243
The indications for operative and conservative treatment are still controversial.	2.282090645823559
Methods and results: From 1974 to 1994, 38 patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department.	2.0274942215880984
Thirty-four of these patients were followed up for 3-16 years (mean: 8.6 years).	2.5173896846620707
In the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone.	2.1762563128934596
At the time of follow-up, 90 % of the patients showed good knee stability, but 90 % had lack of motion as well.	2.5197984536571956
Thirty-five percents of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the Lysholm Score.	2.6525242709051104
Conclusions: Positive prognostic factors were an age less than 40 years at the time of the accident, a low-energy trauma, e. g., a sports-related injury, early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments, and initial postoperative functional treatment.	2.1474329399809813
Huntington's disease (HD) is member of a growing family of neurodegenerative diseases which are caused by a CAG-Triplet expansion in the coding region of their respective genes.	2.0083851231589516
The results of the research of the last years is very suggestive of a common pathomechanisms of all these diseases even though their clinical appearance may be quite different.	2.1119404714274617
The development of new animal models by transferring the human gene defect into the mouse genome has led to the finding of so-called intranuclear inclusion bodies.	2.1303289329953086
This new observation allowed to come closer to solving the problem how this genetic defect causes neurodegeneration.	1.8775774498613378
Recent studies on transgenic HD mice could also demonstrate a possible connection between the genetic defect and glutamate exitotoxicity in the neurodegenerative process of HD which had been emphasized by earlier animal models of the disease.	1.8569127788879765
Transgenic animal models of HD will have an important impact on the understanding of the disease mechanisms and may contribute to a faster development and testing of new therapeutic approaches.	2.676575452823783
However, the pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy (PPPD) is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function.	2.0721750168235316
Methods: In a prospective randomized trial (October 1994-October 1998) PD and PPPD were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life, operation time, duration of hospital stay, transfusions and perioperative morbidity.	2.244451205592921
Quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions (EORTC-QLQ-30) pre- and postoperatively (weeks 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60).	1.9991062835619329
Results: A duodenopancreatectomy was performed in 48 patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas (n = 38) and the periampullary region (n = 10) (PD, n = 24; PPPD, n = 24).	2.4948635462727737
The PD and PPPD groups did not differ according to age, gender or UICC stage.	2.3718928061695874
Operation time was shorter in the PPPD group (206  +/-  48 vs 306  +/-  54 min) (P < 0.05).	1.977110517011181
Morbidity did not differ between the two groups (PPPD 20 % vs PD 30 %, P > 0.05).	2.2747882354675695
While there was no difference in global quality of life, gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the PPPD group regarding appetite, nausea and diarrhea (P < 0.05).	2.334014898067708
Conclusion: PPPD seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than PD.	2.967950202017975
Oxygen uptake (V.O2) and carbon dioxide elimination (V.CO2) can be measured with an indirect calorimeter; this method is well established in routine monitoring of ICU patients to evaluate metabolic state as a reflection of stress.	2.1191421385208904
In various experimental studies it was demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole-body metabolism.	2.105083833765079
The purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable changes in metabolism can be detected immediately.	2.095353327363623
We therefore used this operation for our study.	2.3379952597242566
For certain indications, anterior fusion of the lumbar spine is a standard operation.	2.5237941555749113
The surgeon specializing in operations on the vertebral column must leam to utilize the advantages of laparoscopic surgery.	2.163132589587877
However, an absolute must before applying the technique to humans is adequate training in its use in living animals.	1.9589451981896033
For this purpose, the pig is a highly suitable model.	2.157198617408714
The surgical team comprises a surgeon experienced in spinal procedures, an abdominal surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic surgery and an experienced cameraman.	1.9586839530084856
In the animal model, a change in position - organ preparation from the cranial direction, a suprasymphysial approach to the vertebrae - has proved expedient.	1.9783025092348303
Operational interventions can be planned and simulated accurately with the help of a three-dimensional reconstruction of the anatomical bone structures, created from the tomographic data of a patient.	2.3706640798646257
Computer-assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can assist the intraoperative realization of the planned intervention and may support the spatial orientation within the operational field.	1.8605823277944074
The desmoplastic type of the squamous cell carcinoma (DSCC) of the skin is an entity which is readily distinguished by light microscopy.	2.5565524279654337
The DSCC has fine branches surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma and shows in some cases typical perineural, perivascular and widespread intradermal invasion (maximum 6 cm!).	1.8205581526431496
This type accounts for 8.2% (n=44) of our collective of 594 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the skin and vermilion border.	2.247561086691179
Clinically DSCC look like other malignant epithelial tumors of the skin.	2.654971174003123
All tumors were followed up for at least 3 years (maximum 10 years).	2.325735652421131
The local recurrence rate was high (24.3%) even though micrographic surgery was carried out.	2.2802582718252933
The rate of local or regional metastasis was also very high (22.7%).	2.115434071986006
In comparison the recurrence rate and the rate of metatasis of the remaining common 91.8% SCC's (n=550) was low: 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively.	2.0879095592085264
The DSCC seems to be identical with the so called neurotropic SCC, the fine stranded SCC or the SCC with perineural invasion which have a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis as well, but DSCC is a better generic histopathologic term for the entire group.	1.97470858167309
The DSCC is best treated with micrographic surgery and wider safety margins than any other type and should be followed up very frequently.	2.1532566486040428
In the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness.	2.025801919616871
The interaction between the patient with ALS and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication, especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support.	2.3749424381827726
The patient and his family must be informed thoroughly about the natural history and the prognosis of ALS, depending on the individual disease process.	2.39379393942429
Already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled.	2.4885572929547743
If ALS patients are not informed about the acute respiratory insufficiency they run the risk of having to be intubated and mechanically ventilated over a long term.	2.308421021619647
Background: The advent of multidetector CT (MDCT) constitutes a quantum leap creating a wealth of new opportunities in medical imaging.	1.8395422743981107
However, while the basic principles of spiral CT still apply, we are now challenged to rethink our strategies in planning a CT study to take full advantage of the increased capabilities of MDCT.	2.044720283327589
Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP), a therapeutic modality that has been under investigation for some years, is based on separation of a leucocyte/lymphocyte-enriched cell fraction from the peripheral blood, extracorporeal treatment of the cells with 8-MOP/UVA and subsequent reinfusion of the cells in the patient.	2.1979615799029815
Its main effects seem to consist in changes to the immunologic behaviour of the photoinactivated/modulated cells.	1.9665681183511692
The immune response of the host is obviously stimulated by this treatment.	2.208530162230766
ECP is normally performed for 4 h per day on 2 consecutive days every 4 weeks.	2.1170240681577503
The treatment is well tolerated and causes few side effects.	2.2852064958900913
In our department, 1210 ECP treatments were administered to 41 patients between 1990 and 1994 and a preliminary evaluation was performed.	1.9870760482911758
These patients included 21 with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 10 with progressive systemic scleroderma, 4 with chronic graft-versus-host disease and 1 each with pemphigus vulgaris, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, lupus erythematosus and cutaneous mucinosis.	1.761596504964907
Patients with erythroderma and preserved immunocompetence achieved the best responses of all patients with CTCL.	2.318765628460625
A treatment combining ECP with rlFN-, PUVA and/or radiation was also successful in patients with tumour-stage CTCL and lymph node involvement.	2.329048471987727
Progressive systemic scleroderma responded in more than 50% of our cases.	2.4039987858772136
A clear improvement was also observed in the patient with pemphigus vulgaris refractory to standard therapies and in another patient with scleromyxoedema (Arndt-Gottron syndrome).	2.2175673695343425
The effectiveness of ECP seems to be quite well established in CTCL, but remains to be examined in autoimmune dermatoses.	2.319856966781078
ECP is an attractive addition to the dermatological therapies available but our experience is still preliminary.	2.2354231340251762
Opportunistic infections after long-term treatment with azathioprine (AZA) have not been noted in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).	2.684282940457302
We report on a 56-year-old woman with generalized MG who presented with cytomegalovirus infection after being treated with AZA for 17 years.	1.9368517093968318
The indication for immunosuppressive treatment in MG should be regularly reconfirmed, particularly since at least 50% of patients can discontinue AZA after two to four years without risk of exacerbation.	1.8498063570565806
Failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem.	2.1298802008927895
Although ultrasonography has 95 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to erroneous interpretation.	2.056968482960669
We report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal colic and ultrasonographically confirmed cholecystolithiasis.	2.146737906856795
During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the gallbladder could not be detected.	2.6377672663549476
After laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography, agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed.	2.0096106765257717
Right colon diverticulitis, representing 1-3,6 % of cases of diverticular disease is an uncommon cause of right lower quadrant pain.	2.3350955876383632
Its presentation is difficult to distinguish from acute appendicitis.	2.622798922036527
Patients are between 35 and 50 years old, have a history of 2-3 days of abdominal pain and few gastrointestinal symptoms.	2.527950114038738
The diagnosis is best confirmed by computed tomography and colonoscopy.	2.257143007851839
Conservative treatment is justified in uncomplicated disease, whereas perforations, abcesses and inflammatory tumors require resection.	1.9408559044875133
We describe the cases of six patients treated at our institution from 1991 to 1996.	2.4141449539388757
Presentation, geographic variations, diagnostic procedures and management are discussed.	2.31155460869286
Malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis in both clinical and histologic examination of melanocytic nevi.	2.7292213562217387
UV exposure with an erythemagenic dose and mechanical irritation of melanocytic nevi are able to induce reversible morphologic changes which simulate malignant melanoma.	1.938033917346293
These changes are associated with an increased expression of HMB-45 antigen.	2.494865723025297
The increased number of melanocytes located in suprabasal layers of the epidermis is accompanied by a change in keratinocyte adhesion molecule expression.	2.161183232116986
The UV light is also able to influence the adhesive properties of melanocytes in vitro.	2.135317787254425
Therefore, both keratinocyte-derived factors and direct influence of UV on the melanocyte system are probably responsible for the morphologic changes.	2.019925367406285
While these exogenously evoked changes are reversible, the potential biologic relevance - especially a possible role in the initiation of the carcinogenesis cascade - reguires clarification.	2.0789560017143556
Objectives Minimally invasive surgical procedure for removal of the trochanteric bursa and, if necessary, exostosectomy and/or fixation of the iliotibial tract at the greater trochanter.	2.3096609753336454
The treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head involves a continuum based on a radiographic spectrum of disease.	2.2866212403269244
Core decompression or pharmacological agents can be utilized for the earliest small or medium-sized pre-collapsed lesions.	1.9600587243180436
For these types of lesions, osteotomy has been tried by various authors with moderate success.	2.094683000290662
For small or medium lesions that are post-collapse, various bone grafting procedures have been used.	2.177509768840011
This approach should be tempered with a look at the articular cartilage if this is damaged or the lesion is large.	2.061712345852715
Limited femoral resurfacing can be used for hips that do not have acetabular involvement.	2.611526319447671
If there is acetabular involvement, total hip replacement remains the treatment of choice.	2.4390181752765807
Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nerve system.	2.4574847597149403
Clinical hallmarks are symmetric muscle paralysis, areflexia and pronouced autonomic disturbances.	1.941514559720258
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for intensive care support in patients with GBS.	2.8915850546167117
The present report of a 33 year old man with Miller-Fisher syndrome, a variant of the GBS, discusses the management of patients with GBS in the intensive care unit.	2.3038158756442977
The immunocytological detection of disseminated epithelial cells in bone marrow in patients with breast cancer has been performed at many hospitals and institutes since the early 1980s.	2.3593966295793383
Despite numerous publications in this field, it has not been possible to standardize the method and  establish the ideal antibody, either nationally or internationally.	2.2604844924968113
Molecular biological methods using PCR technology could extend the diagnostic spectrum.	2.228612638544444
As a result, immunocytology is still the standard procedure for tumour cell detection.	2.295653572942192
Objective: We report our initial experience with an improved model of the laryngeal mask airway, the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA, commercial name Fastrach), which was designed by A.I.J.	2.154628768048029
Brain to improve blind endotracheal intubation through a laryngeal mask.	2.259168737111855
For several years it has been argued that a chest tube should be placed at the scene of an accident if thoracic trauma is suspected.	2.126742144003686
However, during emergency treatment in hospital it has been observed that a high number of such tubes have been placed incorrectly.	2.3135486447394227
To validate this impression, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical course of 33 trauma victims who had had chest tubes placed at the scene of accident.	2.424330900136109
It was found that 39.4% of the chest tubes were placed completey incorrectly and 21.2% required some correction; 39.4% were placed correctly.	1.9065105511588605
In two cases (6.1%) life-threatening complications developed because of the chest tube, necessitating a thoracotomy in 1 patient and repeated pericardial punction in the other.	2.2767724538091034
Based on the results of our study we believe that a more critical attitude should be adopted to the placement of chest tubes at the scene of the accident.	2.4032672720208192
Based upon the observation that some current approaches of quality assurance do not really come up to the specific characteristics of different psychotherapeutic settings, this article discusses quality assurance from the perspective of inpatient group psychotherapy.	1.8945718783144792
It differentiates issues of structural quality (e.g.	2.146052707910033
the importance of the institutional frame, rules for indication, or treatment concepts), process quality with special consideration of problems connected with short term group treatment, and outcome quality, which in order to be assured needs the development of methods which reflect the group setting adequately.	2.215133949469145
We report on a case of extensive intraabdominal calcifications resulting from previous bacterial peritonitis.	2.118053880772172
The patient suffered from an obstructive ileus.	2.534553243783369
Relaparotomy was performed and the calcifications resected.	2.7384044191720713
To avoid recurrence, radiotherapy (15 Gy) and indomethacin were given.	2.116045852626663
A literature review revealed only two cases of intraabdominal calcifications following peritonitis.	2.1249626286776584
In Germany there is still an urgent need for action in regard to screening for breast cancer.	2.255334153788155
The announcement of research projects for mammography screening proves this.	2.127870338896837
The following reports the results of the Munich field study.	2.645129748623668
In 2 years, 2489 breast cancer cases were registered (status 6/98).	2.0641934576398526
Screening data were available for 1319 patients.	2.6146771984714134
The reduction in mortality, found in randomized studies, due to mammography in women over 50 years old was confirmed.	2.2805271462541463
A relative reduction of 44.8% in 10-year mortality could be estimated through mammography and 25.1% through palpation, in comparison with "doing nothing".	2.0813475297363517
We could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the Munich region.	2.110185835459443
If the mammographies carried out today were used at 2-year intervals for women aged between 50 and 70 years, then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70% of the women.	2.0691932474858925
Insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a typical complication.	2.244775390268483
Between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1997 a total of 604 operations at the ACL were performed in the traumatology department of Nuremberg hospital.	2.2924704862555356
During the same period 48 "transplant failures" were treated.	2.352131073871977
There were various reasons for the failure of the transplant, some of them technical, occurring during the operation or during aftercare.	2.2167156161816077
Another reason for a re-rupture of the transplant was by trauma.The different reasons for the failure of the transplant were analysed in our patient population.	2.3381410736294876
The 48 patients were classified into five groups depending on the primary operation and the means of treatment (I = ACL sutures, II = artificial ligament, III = semitendinosus tendon, IV and V = ipsi- or contralateral bone-patellar-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction), so that the different ways of treatment were better comparable.	1.9841538847676239
Of the 48 patients 36 were followed up over an average of 2 1/2 years using the Lysholm scores and the OAK scores.	2.2270337532949984
The total score of the 36 patients was 81 points and can be valued as good using the evaluation scale of Lysholm and Gillquist.	1.9834038414686201
Using the OAK score we found an average of 71 to 81 points in the different groups; results in the group with the ipsilateral bone-tendon-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction were the worst.	2.2096460433696237
The totalscore using the OAK score was 74 points and was considered "moderate".	2.1778471871181764
The score results were discussed and compared with the current literature.	2.579511609675891
In this case report, we focus on the importance of scurvy as a differential diagnosis in a newborn presenting with swollen legs.	2.285817544333236
Scurvy is rare in highly developed countries and often overlooked.	2.3418101647872116
Medical history, clinical symptoms and radiological findings are crucial for diagnosis.	2.630482524115468
The diagnosis is confirmed by successful treatment with ascorbic acid.	2.1815224996836826
Hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal.	2.2135783451801543
Among these tumors, ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance.	1.9079619120865903
We describe a 26-year old female patient who presented with left-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.	2.461848864559093
T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space-occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion.	2.3455532225040283
Bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high-resolution computed tomography.	2.4978756187999984
A hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach.	2.128648940263807
Histologically, new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma.	2.676689215671719
In general, radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma.	1.9741069228017196
Based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation, the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma.	2.2408868470731136
However, reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation.	2.2910581351581354
Myocardial ischemia results in myocardial dysfunction.	2.5306938485836055
Recovery may be delayed ("stunning"), or persistent if perfusion remains reduced ("hibernation") and ischemia may go on to necrosis, thus, contributing to chronic heart failure.	1.8886032974021236
In addition, myocardium not directly affected by ischemia may undergo adaptive processes like hypertrophy and dilatation, which may result in chronic left heart failure.	2.023536831829287
This process is characterized by hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and progressive morphologic changes of the heart which are closely interrelated.	2.4430555146334716
Hemodynamic changes basically consist of an increase in left ventricular filling pressure and a decrease in global ejection fraction, and, in most cases years after myocardial infarction, in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure.	2.6720500169878667
Neurohumoral changes consist of an increase in plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin, and in an activation of the renin-angiotensin-system.	2.337148634166712
Plasma endothelin-1 was recently reported to be increased in patients with heart failure, and prognosis was related to endothelin levels.	2.647744803561676
Diminished response of vessels to endothelium (EDRF/NO) dependent vasodilatation suggests impairment of vascular endothelium in heart failure.	1.9048600678622247
Local changes of cardiac neurohumoral systems could contribute to structural changes of the heart, e.g., systemic activation to hemodynamic changes.	2.332006818695907
Structural changes of the heart are characterized by an increase in volume and thickness of surviving myocardium and an expansion of ischemic and necrotic myocardium.	2.4807662913612543
Postoperative infection in the locomotor system may lead to malpractice suits.	2.6026677458425795
The aim of the study was to determine the success rate of these claims and the type of expert-confirmed medical negligence so that strategies for avoiding such negligence can be offered.	2.062830644328487
A total of 261 decrees concerning suspected malpractice after postoperative infection in the locomotor system were retrospectively evaluated.	1.9404875035437807
Of these, 43.7 % claims were successful.	2.208039422772417
The most frequent type of negligence was late diagnosis (34.2 %), followed by inconsistant treatment (27.2 %) and insufficient surgical revision (5.3 %).	1.9058484678165808
In 33.3 %, combined types of negligence were found.	2.2536084014758577
Most frequently, negligence was suspected after infection following hand surgery and internal fixation of long bones.	2.2368478717445766
The highest success rate of claims was seen after puncture of joints (69.2 %).	2.1338326210925564
Insufficient documentation was confirmed in 15.3 %.	2.4598268137849564
The majority of negligence resulted from diagnostic and therapeutic doubts, which could be avoided, e. g., by a clear definition of infection, consultation of a second opinion, a 2nd-look operation, undelayed and radical surgical revision, painstaking follow-up and disciplined documentation.	2.180938061473178
Abstract   Patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment.	3.1014439313876094
The aim of the study was to compare health-related quality of life in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular or conventional surgery.	2.5390376982247047
A total of 40 patients were included (20 treated by endovascular and 20 by conventional surgery).	2.061639477804151
A questionnaire with 28 items similar to the SF-36 was answered during scheduled appointments.	2.042315375262818
On the third postoperative day, the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed (80% vs. 32%) and complained of intervention-related pain (90% vs. 42%) and incisional pain (26% vs. 15%); 55% of the patients suffered from obstipation (vs. 5% of the endovascular group).	1.972433815414486
Furthermore, the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified.	2.2412155488587224
In comparable percentage, both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively.	2.0411085329959366
Sexual dysfunction was more frequent in the conventional group (33% vs. 13% three months postoperative).	2.2112718859540306
In addition, the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities (25% vs. 40%) and had more fear of ambulation (35% vs. 6%).	1.8505461024460013
The patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations (39% vs. 5%) that were often related to X-ray exposure (67% vs. 20%).	2.062298890203048
All of the conventionally operated patients had a sense of improvement (vs. 89% of the endovascular group); nevertheless only 28% felt completely healthy, compared to 11% of the endovascular treated patients.	2.0406868947712904
Advantages of the endovascular treated patients were "short hospital stay", "decreased pain", "smaller scars", and a "shorter confinement to bed".	2.2729704727559983
After intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality-of-life aspects.	2.2235103426360623
After 3 months, differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities.	2.2526997074070167
The patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent X-ray examinations than the conventionally treated group.	2.2757751107235693
In the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period.	2.1838355639195233
However, about 20% of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation.	2.7812343057834243
Apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive, the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles.	2.1202368844432
Furthermore, beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are, e.g., left heart failure, inadequate sedation, neuropsychiatric issues, malnutrition and aspiration.	1.9774419973146766
The mere application of a consistent weaning strategy (independent from its concrete content) leads to an improved success rate.	2.1532909914108536
In this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with: 1) The concept of interventions (in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes unloading respiratory muscles), 2) pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3) organisation of the T-tube trials.	1.8314824968468553
A new approach in weaning of long-term ventilated patients is non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NMV).	2.5913883817650256
Compared to invasive mechanical ventilation NMV aims at reducing weaning time, decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis.	1.960520982418746
Finally, the last section addresses terminal weaning.	2.198098143233864
The psychoanalytic cure is characterized by a basic antinomy of time and time-lessness.	2.4281532994312705
Freud based the daily psychoanalytic work on the order of the mechanic clock (the time of the machine) to regulate a relationship which is unique in our culture.	2.1297066380147083
The temporal order of the cure responds to the logic of the temporal path.	2.1582770381091136
"Symmetrical madness" prevails (Matte Blanco).	2.2126276625808043
The temporal core of the analytic situation is bi-logical.	2.202928584402224
This ambiguity is reflected in the technical principles.	2.398151179178767
Free association breaks through the logic of the temporal path, again and again.	2.11694208901476
There are, however, different defence strategies defusing its unforeseeability.	2.553643161599651
The tension between the time that determines the analytic setting and the timelessness of free association gets once again a process of temporal order going.	1.8619674468481855
Present social changes and in connection with them the changed time strategies endanger the temporal order of the analytic cure.	2.1204356470910004
Indeed, family studies, segregation analyses and twin studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in disposition towards migraine but could not explain the entire aetiopathogenesis.	2.012386829716578
The influence of extragenetic factors, however, remains mostly unknown.	2.5443596666156405
Recent linkage analyses have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity.	2.3160386271910465
A locus for Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM), the only known type of migraine that follows autosomal-dominant transmission, has been linked to chromosome 19p13 but genetic heterogeneity has also been shown, i. e. different types of migraine could be excluded from this locus.	2.1457082486295986
Further investigations should concentrate on identifying the FHM gene on chromosome 19p13, on linkage analyses with markers for different susceptibility genes, and on genomic analyses of highly informative pedigrees.	1.8293929165249327
This would lead to further clues to the pathogenesis underlying migraine and, thus, to therapeutic developments.	2.278086256521474
Radiographic findings suggestive of osteopenia and osteoporosis are frequently encountered in daily medical practice and can result from a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from highly prevalent causes such as postmenopausal and involutional osteoporosis to very rare endocrinologic and hereditary or acquired disorders.	1.7822141400144695
As bone mass is lost, changes in the trabecular and cortical bone structure occur.	2.3549624788272387
The changes that are visible on conventional radiographs may give specific information on the etiology of the underlying disease.	2.3681142346082944
Even though conventional radiography is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis, visual assessment of bone mass and its changes is subjective and strongly depends on the radiographic technique.	2.1473240325946135
With radiogrammetry and radiographic absorptiometry two methods exist that rely on conventional radiography and allow for a quantification of bone mass.	1.9902997801379412
This article describes the author's experience during the 1-year AGA Pittsburgh fellowship from 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997.	1.893599465059793
The article is focused on the work in the Musculoskeletal Research Center and the Center for Sports Medicine of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in Pittsburgh.	2.0746174165616047
The author describes projects on the biomechanics of the cruciate ligaments, using robotic technology.	2.0615776306944773
Organizational and social aspects of the life in Pittsburgh are discussed.	2.4351276493412195
The different subgroups of hypercalciuria cannot be separated clearly by the Pak calcium-load test.	1.852206453034529
To improve the diagnosis and therapy we examined all relevant parameters of calcium metabolism in 32 patients with calcium urolithiasis and hypercalciuria (> 6.25 mmol/day).	2.0781380470115027
We also conducted bone mineral density measurements as well as the Pak calcium-load test.	2.2932798056049006
In most cases the pathophysiological constellations which Pak takes as the basis for his classification of hypercalciuria could not be shown.	2.246348936155972
To date, diagnostics only insufficiently explains the genesis of hypercalciuria (except pHPT).	1.931869109997754
As a consequence, a therapeutic problem arises: a low-calcium diet should not be generally recommended, since some patients may develop osteopenia.	2.078912929444365
From our investigation the following diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions can be drawn: (1) Hypercalciuria in primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated by surgical removal of the adenoma.	2.558809456454904
(2) The parathormone-independent osteogenic form should be treated with thiazides.	2.583523465025426
(3) Hypercalciuria with increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D should be treated by low-calcium diet.	2.3146895020765537
A 58-year old man with wilson's disease sustained a bilateral spontaneous rupture of the quadriceps tendon.	2.4603254994823343
The histological investigation showed advanced degeneration of tendon structure and cupper deposits.	2.037171447196238
After tenosuture the patient had complete cure with full range of movement.	2.3420068460648946
We discuss about relation of wilson x s disease, cupper deposits and degenerative changes of tendon tissue.	1.8943905515811426
This opened more opportunities than simply creating a new normative sample for the German adult population.	2.0461906312934097
Thus, the very complex interdependence between morbidity, satisfaction, risk factors, health related behaviours, social status, age and sex on the one side and the subjective assessment of health related quality of life on the other hand may be investigated.	2.2440290856706846
First results of the Survey data are presented which open the discussion of the possibilities and limits of the SF-36 instrument for measuring health related quality of life at the population level.	2.2391414144592945
Originally described by the Finish physician Erik von Willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis, hypermenorhoea and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures.	1.8597426483997466
In von Willebrands disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) which has two major functions: it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall, and it circulates as a complex with factor VIII, protecting it from rapid degradation.	1.8064108855936976
More than 20 different types and subtypes of vWD have been described but almost all patients can be classified as having 1 of the 2 most common types of vWD.	2.29545869773032
About 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10-20 % present themself with type 2A and 2B vWD type 3 in about 10 %.	2.0118096554554534
By taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vWD and to make the appropriate diagnosis.	2.2845360777452837
If the vWD is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, factor VIII:C, Ristocetin cofactor, and vWF antigen.	1.776685873739225
Additional testing of ristocetin induced plattlet adhesion (RIPA), the multimeric structure and collagen binding test and gen-analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v. Willebrand Disease.	1.9290894532229972
In patients with severe type 1, type 2B, 2N and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin, the appropriate treatment is a factor VIII concentrate that is rich of vWF.	1.9370127137031272
Until now no recommendations in the orthopaedic literature have been found regarding diagnosis and treatment of vWS patients.	2.2734162977904573
Based on the experience with 43 orthopaedic patients presenting vWD over the last 15 years a contemporary guideline for the successful perioperative management of vWD in orthopaedic surgery is presented.	1.9350423904859
In a close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon and the specialized haemostaseologist every invasive procedure in patients with vWD can be undertaken without the risk of excessive bleeding.	2.3093115524752967
Patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) have a high risk of perioperative reinfarction compared with the normal population (5%-8% vs. 0.1%-0.7%) [10].	2.3466812394944494
According to Rao [13], a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range.	1.9969101780310106
In most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as Rao recommended: this would overstrain both hospital structure and financial resources.	2.075068734935797
We studied the incidence of perioperative MI and other cardiac events in patients with prior MI.	2.7993228847169616
During the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced.	2.049464305484471
In addition to this clinical evaluation, we performed perioperative Holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin T (parts II and III).	1.9899453262827314
Small basal cell carcinomas of the trunk are usually regarded as relatively harmless.	2.5610506767060657
In contrast, large and ulcerating basal cell carcinomas may become a therapeutic challenge with a less favourable prognosis and high risk of recurrence.	2.2007871253987457
The development of mutilating giant basal cell carcinomas appears less due to the biological aggressive character of the tumors, but rather to the patients' attitude of neglect.	2.2930050766369843
The case of a 62-year-old patient, featuring such attitude, demonstrates how a common basal cell carcinoma of the trunk can grow over a period of years to a troublesome ulcerating tumor.	2.2134951691718787
This epidemiologic, retrospective follow-up mortality study is based on the data gathered in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital of Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main.	2.235586867565976
Over a period of 21 years (1972-1992), roughly 21,000 forensic autopsies revealed 39 cases (0.19%) of natural deaths occuring during sexual activity.	1.8289571623909173
Except for two women, all of these cases were men of an average age of 61.3 years.	2.44360818412124
The most frequent cause of death was myocardial infarction (n=21/53.8%), three of these cases involving pericardial tamponade accompanied by myomalacia.	2.2293366923670224
The medical history of twelve of the deceased showed a previous myocardial infarction.	2.2489063146167605
Most of the deaths took place during or after sexual intercourse or manual stimulation.	2.014529651024876
In most cases sudden death occured during the sexual act with a prostitute.	1.9792545492284532
The annual incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths during sexual activity is estimated to be 0.2/100,000 men.	2.1040766766424683
The risk for women is lower by a factor of 12.	2.3046005491308126
Current concepts in treating arthritis by gene transfer are described, including different vector systems and strategies of gene transfer into target cells.	1.9453495189929144
Promissing antiarthritic gene products are a variety of growth factors which facilitate increased matrix synthesis and mitogensis in articular chondrocytes.	2.187104610138313
Furthermore, rheumatoid joint destruction can be treated genetically by the transfer of certain antiinflammatory cytokine genes, which provide locally high concentrations of the antiinflammatory gene product.	1.978995177919922
First clinical trails using the IRAP gene (interleukin I receptor antagonist protein) to eliminate the inflammatory reaction caused by interleukin I in rheumatoid joints are on its way.	1.8321384853016762
In order to investigate potential improvement in cartilage regeneration retroviral TGF- gene transfer in rabbit articular chondrocytes has been carried out.	1.872304808911853
The TGF- group showed an in vitro increase in collagen type II neosynthesis by 304 %, compared to normal chondrocytes.	2.0632415739591132
Spreading depression is a fascinating phenomenon that can be provoked by chemical, electrical or mechanical stimuli of the cortex.	2.0828481903559712
Spreading depression-like transient depolarizations are observed in the periinfarct tissue after focal ischemia.	2.1410757063917925
The reduction in electrical activity and a negative direct current potential shift propagating over the cortex with a rate of 2-5 mm/minute are the physiological hallmarks.	2.0308217328653053
It is thought that spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations might play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine and stroke.	2.078823733990396
However, these events have never been detected in humans.	2.265751912180124
This paper reviews the physiological characteristics of spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations and discusses their potential role in migraine and stroke.	1.7331515669061972
Because of the shifting age peak, measles, mumps and rubella will be more and more a danger for adults.	1.957421666626173
The MMR combined vaccination reveals an effective method for prevention of these diseases and their consecutive symptoms.	2.3523628189009247
By means of the twice-done MMR vaccination measles, mumps and the congenital rubella syndrome could be eliminated.	1.8896575293487747
With the increasing demands on hospitals for improved quality and lower costs, hospitals have been forced to reevaluate their manner of operation and quality assurance programms.	1.9060612147044549
Hospitals have also been faced with customer dissatisfaction and intense competition.	2.1730172282607123
The continuous follow-up of all cruciate ligament lesions showed the correctness of patient-adapted procedures.	2.28638443487818
While the gold standard for repair is a replacement procedure, direct repair with autologous augmentation is an excellent option in adolescents.	2.1105690251656717
The results of 13 single-stage reconstructions of large and complex defects in the head and neck by using eight free radial forearm flaps as well as five pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps were analyzed.	2.1143727741170824
Due to the time needed for the microvascular anastomoses, the length of the operations was sometimes prolonged.	2.1592127485682395
Pectoralis major flaps were found to be more difficult to handle and were used in those cases in which the application of free radial forearm flaps was expected to produce higher risks.	2.4482822449334343
Psychotherapists have the alternative, to design quality assurance within certain boundaries by themselves, or otherwise leave this important task to external instances.	1.8460273238758458
Those will apply their own criteria in developing a concept.	2.2049928953283366
This paper discusses the question, how far quality assurance in the field of analytic psychotherapy has to accept the definitions and concepts from other fields such as industry or somatic medicine, without changing or deteriorating the quality that in the end should be improved.	1.9298511296318663
This paper points out new approaches to modifying the present concept of quality assurance for the purposes of analytic psychotherapy.	2.02659974067931
Cicatrical pemphigoid (CP) comprises a groupf of patients with a chronic subepidermal blistering disease which primarily involves mucous membranes; lesions characteristically heal with scarring.	2.1083217165048964
Immunofluorescence investigations typically demonstrate deposits of tissue bound and circulating immunoreactants of the IgG and less frequently of the IgA class in a linear pattern along the basement membrane zone.	1.737212137447735
These autoantibodies are thought to play an important role in the blister formation of CP.	2.3393572350225926
Most patients show binding to the bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BPag2), collagen type XVII, with a molecularweight of 180 kD.	2.003462608973529
A smaller group of patients with CP have autoantibodies to laminin 5.	2.6499233085633094
Animal models confirm that autoantibodies binding to these two adhesion molecules (BPag2 and laminin 5) are important in blister formation.	1.9634672673405418
There are other autoantigens described in CP; however, they are only found in small groups of CP patients and most of them are not further characterised.	2.1154575784854472
The described molecules are part of the hemidesmosomal adhesion complex.	2.5649668661480396
Impaired function of any component of this complex may lead to a separation of the epidermis from the dermis; better knowledge about the single molecules and the exact localisation of epitopes within these molecules may lead to further understanding of the clinical picture.	2.3915367558693217
Study objective: The clinical effect of ketoprofen is based not only on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.	2.207375423186127
Ketoprofen also acts through kynurenic acid as a central antagonist on the NMDA receptor.	2.0653215690674576
Due to this central analgesic mechanism of ketoprofen, we expected an analgesic preemptive effect.	1.9397622212207257
This study was carried out following the Breivik/Stubhaug preemptive effect study design.	2.1773014689659176
Dystopies of the bony orbit are caused mainly by craniosynostosis, facial clefts and encephaloceles.	2.0875861241204343
Using this operation technique, the bony interorbital distance was decreased from an average of 47.6 mm to 22.8 mm.	2.2118635602145424
However, the distance between the soft tissues was not reduced by the same amount as the distance between the bony orbits.	2.058708233097916
The intercanthal distance decreased from an average of 58.5 mm to 44.5 mm, whereby an additional refixation of the medial palpebral ligament resulted in a reduction of the intercanthal distance to 40.8 mm.	2.210260838306707
A strabismus divergens was seen preoperatively in 18 patients, postoperatively only in 8 patients.	2.2759640771143297
Four of the latter had to undergo operative correction of the diplopia.	2.396688168929753
We conclude that the operative technique is not reserved only for complex cases of hypertelorism because it shows satisfactory functional and aesthetic results with a low complication rate.	2.0888055111394026
Four years after extensive pneumonectomy on the left side with resection of the aortic wall and patch reconstruction for a T4 carcinoma, 2 years after adjuvant radiation and 10 months after drainage therapy of late intrathoracic empyema, destruction of the infected Dacron patch led to rupture of the aorta descendens.	2.1288367198711606
Successful primary emergency reconstruction of the aorta descendens was followed by venetian blind plasty (Heller) and transposition of the omentum majus for omentoplasty of the aortal wall and reduction of the pneumonectomy cavity.	2.003832066094397
The rate of prosthetic infections is between 0.3 and 2.5% and must be taken into consideration even in cases of intrathoracic vascular reconstruction with alloplastic prostheses.	2.1697086869573856
After lung resection it is necessary to cover up the prosthetic graft by using autogenous material to obtain prosthetic incorporation into the protective tissue.	1.9938201028589495
In intrathoracic infectious complications, extra-anatomic bypass grafting or autogenous vascular graft implantation should be considered.	2.138489782879645
If there is no possibility of carrying out these procedures, first aggressive local debridement of the infected vascular wall and afterwards coverage with alloplastic prosthetics with omentum transposition and thoracoplasty are essential to minimize postoperative infection and obtain solid anchorage in the surrounding tissue.	1.842697383511602
The evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most intriguing and challenging aspects of the daily practice in dermatohistopathology.	2.297537728399318
For the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and melanocytic nevi, standardized and reproducible criteria are required.	2.519345786980643
In case of the diagnosis of melanoma, the histopathological report must include all important data relevant for the prognosis which may also influence the therapeutic procedure.	2.291102481958385
The following paper summarizes the recommendations of the study group on malignant melanoma formed by the Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft.	2.325567790285926
Recent studies have shown that acute infections, especially of the respiratory tract, are an important risk factor for cerebral ischemia.	2.436301017889712
Additionally we know that chronic dental infections may be a risk for myocardial infarction and artherosclerosis.	2.4744237128006867
However, the connection between stroke and dental infections has hardly been examined so far.	2.0207673294824824
Therefore we performed a case-control study using a standardized questionaire and examination.	2.357465001644093
We investigated 66 patients consecutive to a acute cerebral ischemia/stroke and 60 age- and sex-matched nonstroke neurological patients as a control group.	1.9079338103459578
Dental status was determined by a so called total dental index (TDI) which reflects primarily caries, periodontitis, periapical lesions, devital and missing teeth as well as by a panoramic index (PI).	1.9300345422354868
Specifically, older patients with cerebrovascular ischemia tended to have a significantly worse dental status and had more severe periodontitis and periapical lesions than control subjects.	2.0360661672135194
A predefined poor dental status was associated with cerebrovascular ischemia independent from other vascular risk factors and social status.	2.2654624255654174
As chronic dental infections are a common and also easily treatable factor, their identification as a risk factor for stroke would be quite important in the field of preventive medicine.	2.199676814059714
Adjuvant basic therapy plays a central role  in the therapeutic approach to atopic eczema in childhood.	2.5280064783195115
It involves the regular use of emollients and oil baths according to the clinical picture.	2.464226399855762
Emollients containing urea may cause problems when used in younger children due to their stinging effect.	2.1514530085847947
Glucocorticosteroids still form the mainstay  of anti-inflammatory therapy and are superior to other topical drugs with anti-inflammatory effects.	2.32672353580829
Systemic use of antibiotics is essential in cases of impetiginized atopic eczema.	2.819120865486514
In cases of bacterial-triggered eczema, the topical use of antibiotics in cases of limited or of antiseptics in generalized disease may be helpful.	2.213750235860368
The present paper presents data obtained over a 12 year period, on the matrix synthesis and turnover in some 650 arthritic and 180 non-arthritic (N) human cartilages using a standardised in vitro method.	1.9564977192150468
When the relative metabolic (synthetic/repair activity) of these human cartilages was compared, it was demonstrated that in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cartilages synthetic activity was diminished by approximately 50% as compared with N cartilages.	1.9280466655702297
However, the turnover rate of matrix was not significantly different between Non-arthritic and OA, but was very substantially increased in RA cartilages compatible with the activity of inflammatory cells and proteolytic enzymes released from pannus.	1.8981278153453267
The action of 13 NSAIDs was compared in terms of their effect on cartilage GAG synthesis.	2.2191117598947474
3 of these NSAIDs were also studied in terms of their effect on cartilage collagen synthesis.	2.2714004086000785
Consideration of the results in this study and from published material, led to the suggestion that NSAIDs may be divided into 3 categories in respect of their in vitro action on the extracellular matrix of human arthritic cartilages:   1.	2.195586463079882
Those such as Aceclofenac, Tenidap and Tolmetin which can stimulate matrix synthesis 2.	1.977365557317894
Those such as Piroxicam, Tiaprofenic Acid and Aspirin which appear to be without significant effect on matrix synthesis and, 3.	1.9975802466936405
Those like Naproxen, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin, Nimezulide which significantly inhibit matrix synthesis.	1.8754163420325938
It is suggested that the stimulatory action of group 1 NSAID is due to inhibition of locally produced IL1 and consequent expression of growth factor activity.	1.9841080132002362
Other NSAIDs may also inhibit IL1 synthesis or release, but probably do not have a beneficial effect on chondrocyte synthetic activity as they have toxic effects on cartilage metabolism.	1.874134823499563
These experiments led to the suggestion that NSAIDs such as Aceclofenac would be appropriate for long-term treatment of arthritic conditions provided that one is prepared to extrapolate between in vitro experiments on human cartilage and what may be happening in vivo.	1.9144118933005783
The article begins with a general introduction to the problems of pre-operative anxiety and its impact on the post-operative course development.	2.4893116965489464
Then the treatment of a patient who developed an anxiety-syndrome before a necessary heart operation is described.	2.751960603337497
The treatment lasted 6 hours and included psychotherapy by guided affective imagery.	2.0096848307412976
One and a half years later a follow-up interview was carried out by a colleague of the original therapist.	2.628344827621135
The interview was based on the assumption that patients are able to give a competent statement about their previous treatment.	2.5735686172779255
The results are discussed under the aspect of therapeutic factors of psychotherapy.	2.1657164422492596
Physiologically, angiogenesis in adults is a controlled process which plays a role, for example, in wound healing.	2.3787952992050525
Pathological angiogenesis is observed in tumor formation and represents a multifactorial process, in which specific angiogenic factors, as well as growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules are involved.	2.2922022037520304
Tumor growth is characterized by an imbalance in favor of angiogenic over angiogenesis-inhibiting factors.	2.3538787355430757
Some of the most frequently examined angiogenic factors are vascular endothelial growth factor, acidic/basic fibroblast growth factors and the platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor.	2.1221630675423433
The most important angiogenesis inhibitors are angiostatin and thrombospondin.	2.053894571812549
To date, the clinical relevance of tumor angiogenesis has been shown for several human tumors.	2.5974317932656126
For most urological tumors, the grade of tumor vessel formation, measured as microvessel density, has been associated with metastases, tumor growth and clinical course.	2.1112852940714273
The prognostic value of this feature of malignant growth seems to be higher than that of most of the classical and newer prognostic factors.	2.600793006563026
Systematic investigations of tumor angiogenesis are becoming increasingly relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and offer opportunities for the development of new specific therapeutic approaches in clinical oncology.	2.4448963528892076
Introduction: CPR is an essential part of resuscitation.	2.6098912049413183
German medical students must take part in at least two low-level basic life support courses, one for a driver's license and one for admission to medical school.	1.9901259280426484
The knowledge and skill of German medical students in CPR performance were studied.	2.0507483292706916
Psychoanalysis is regarded to be mainly disorderoriented.	2.4280050157240236
Indeed, since its beginning, it was characterised by the two-sided orientation towards disorder and resources.	2.25617752469697
Contemporary concepts of the psychoanalytic encounter, especially actualgenetic conceptions of the analysis of transference, lay the ground for better integrating both aspects.	2.015363002149982
This development implies new approaches to the psychoanalytic process and technique, and especially to interpretation.	2.4053604347322257
More than before, contemporary psychoanalytic interpretation refers to progressive coping strategies within and outside transferential processes.	1.8668499257948394
During the last few decades, traumatic injuries of the hip joint have significantly increased in number, and traffic accidents have also increased.	2.226800024206304
Depending on the speed, direction of the forces and the position of the femur at the moment of impact, different patterns of injury occur.	2.1385903553694554
Basically, they are classified as hip dislocations, dislocation fractures and acetabular fractures.	2.225729753910117
These injuries have in common a high rate of concomitant lesions.	2.5016225465084037
Several classification systems have been developed for these injuries.	2.9125884195713767
Commonly, Stewart and Milford's or Levin's classification is used for dislocations and dislocation fractures.	2.058499178333362
For acetabular fractures, Judet and Letournel's classification and its newer version developed by Helfet (AO classification) are generally accepted.	2.002695673074351
Fractures of the femoral head, though included in these classifications, are typically described by separate classifications like the one presented in 1957 by Pipkin.	1.9867047637844315
The multitude of injuries occuring in the hip joint requires vast knowledge of various operative approaches.	2.2017847228961003
No single approach exists that would permit the treatment of all injuries in an ideal fashion.	2.4581392440266674
Approaches are either considered limited (Kocher-Langenbeck, ilioinguinal iliofemoral) when they permit access only to a restricted segment of the joint, or extended (extended iliofemoral, Maryland, Ruedi) when they allow all-around visualization of the hip joint.	1.862692232605155
The choice of the best approach for an individual patient depends on the type of injury and also on patient variables like age, preexisting disease, and concomitant injuries.	2.374601009620825
The decision is further influenced by the timing of surgery, the kind of fracture stabilization intended and by complications typically seen with certain approaches.	2.1583244660201073
The indication for extended procedures is only seen in patients with complex injury patterns involving both the anterior and the posterior column or in delayed cases undergoing surgery more than 3 weeks after trauma.	2.1819464986523696
Extended approaches permit excellent visualization of the fracture, but the extent of the soft tissue trauma is reflected in a high rate of postoperative complications.	3.0816174490729074
After a phase in which extended procedures were favored, recently a trend towards more limited approaches can be recognized because of their lower complication rate.	1.905783561848158
This is facilitated by modern fracture-reduction methods using indirect techniques.	2.015686632250679
A relation between myocardial ischemia and induction of ventricular arrhythmias can be demonstrated in patients with coronary heart disease - in contrast to patients with primary non ischemic cardiac diseases - using a combined metabolic-electrophysiological investigation protocol consisting of programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation with simultaneous measurement of the arterio/coronary venous difference for lactate, pyruvate, free fatty acids and amino acids.	2.0481186081394727
There are significant metabolic distinctions between both ischemic and non ischemic heart disease under pacing stress conditions as well as at rest.	2.1841078574296295
A 52 year old female with Parry-Romberg syndrome presented with gradual atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and muscle on her chest and back.	1.9839117460114593
The disease process was limited to the C3 to T2 dermatomes on the right side.	2.1554528601944094
In addition, there was muscle atrophy of the right arm and extending down the back to T10, als well as right sided paralysis of the diaphragm.	2.0838861447397123
Sympathetic nerve blockage reduced pain and hyperesthesia; no progression was seen over several months using NMR to monitor the patient.	1.9577439100630196
Between 1990 and 1996, 129 children (mean age 4.8 years) with hip pain were examined consecutively.	2.398383570470985
In group I (n = 100, mean age 4.14  +/-  2.2), transient synovitis of the hip was diagnosed; group II (n = 29, mean age 7.3  +/-  2.1) showed the following diagnoses: Perthes' disease (n = 12), early slipped capital femoral epiphysis (n = 5), Meyer's dysplasia (n = 2), septic arthritis of the hip (n = 2), osteomyelitis of the acetabulum (n = 1), abscess of the psoas (n = 1), chondromatosis of the hip joint (n = 1), Ewing's sarcoma of the os pubis (n = 1), hip dysplasia (n = 1).	2.208678465232703
Three patients who had synovitis developed Perthes' disease and were assigned to group II.	2.3547339642297898
The efficiency of ultrasound, scintigraphy and MRI as diagnostic tools was tested in the examination of painful hip.	2.279528275238527
A capsular distension was present in 73 cases and showed a significant statistical difference (t-test, P < 0.001) in group I between affected and unaffected hips.	2.426673824848863
There were no differences in the measurements of the epiphyseal and metaphyseal width in group I between the affected and the non-affected side (t-test, P = 0.91, P = 0.57) and between the first sonographic evaluation at presentation and at the follow-up (t-test, P = 0.053, P = 0.75).	2.12438394438498
MRI was performed, because of persistent joint effusion, in 10 cases in group I, and Perthes' disease was excluded.	2.637378485106404
In group II the use of an MRI allowed the diagnosis in 89 % of the cases.	2.735884246147266
Sonographic examination, together with X-ray examination and serological testing, represent the first choices in the evaluation of a painful hip at presentation and in the follow-up of transient synovitis.	2.555125102654473
MRI should always be performed when abnormalities are present at the clinical and sonographic examination, and when the X-ray does not allow a clear diagnosis.	2.506599027043462
A 36-year old woman was presented to our hospital with congenital ventricular septal defect and one-vessel coronary artery disease (75% proximal left main coronary artery) for CABG and repair of the VSD.	2.110954869455423
After induction, a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) baseline examination was performed, showing a severely dilated coronary sinus (CS) measuring approximately 3 cm (abnormal >1 cm).	1.8860890079608272
We suggested a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) draining into the CS.	2.0576184195066136
PLSVC is a common venous congenital anomaly, with a reported incidence of 0.5% in general population and in 3-5 % of patients with congenital heart defect.	2.6662645056106395
Injection of echo-contrast solution in a left arm vein, visualizing microbubbles passing through the PLSVC into the CS confirmed our suspicion.	1.8309907317397116
The diagnosis of a PLSVC and dilated CS is a contraindication for retrograde cardioplegia because of the loss of cardioplegia into the PLSVC resulting in a inadequate myocardial protection.	2.102668491074863
It may be difficult to pass a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) through a left internal or left subclavian vein and it may be associated with arrythmias.	2.113288075421534
A chest radiograph shows the anomalous course of the PAC along the left heart.	2.3914554262998493
Teleradiologysystems can differ considerably in their features.	2.3820150252003023
The most important differences lie in the mode of image data acquisition, data transfer, data safety aspects and the possibilities of interaction between seperate teleradiology units.	1.9632974412684454
Craniopharyngiomas are the third frequent pediatric brain tumors.	2.3331501845990443
Complications after surgical treatment are common.	2.8429609715928037
The most frequent complications are endocrine disturbances, vision field defects, deteriorated acuity, cognitive or psychological deficiency as well as significant weight gain.	2.123377140692785
A case of complete vision loss right after surgical removal of craniopharyngioma is reported.	2.042109048024497
Magnetic resonance image showed an edema of the chiasm.	2.368607478853615
No damage of anatomical structure could be detected.	2.511277695922404
Seventeen days after surgery the patient reported intermittent  visual impressions for the first time.	2.354742879914519
Over the following weeks his visus improved to  0.5, while the chiasm edema disappeared.	2.2175581432606455
Electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) allows viszalization and quantification of calcium in the coronary arteries.	2.2682612479998348
This has been demonstrated to correlate well with the overall plaque burden in the coronary arteries.	2.321917803588663
EBCT is, therefore, well suited for the detection of early stages of coronary atherosclerosis.	2.718881692109236
Especially in asymptomatic patients with several risk factors, staging coronary artery disease by coronary calcium, scanning may allow prognostic assessment and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions.	2.023390130278324
We report an unusual complication in a 53-year-old woman following ileostomy for Crohn's disease 22 years previously.	2.0436578621574006
A stenosis of the distal colonic segment was the reason for the formation and subsequent rupture of a huge colonic mucocele.	2.4534600194182694
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a ruptured mucocele of colonic origin after ileostomy.	1.9703906398761324
The brain is an important target organ for gonadal hormones.	2.5035432950483814
Estrogens have protective and trophic effects on neural systems and modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems.	2.0250619910622722
Initial studies support the hypothesis that estrogen therapy in menopause may have protective effects toward the development of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.	2.208812128933646
Furthermore, estrogens may improve verbal fluency, memory, and mood in elderly women.	1.938069696295248
Still, the available evidence is not sufficient to support general treatment recommendations with respect to estrogens and the therapeutic targets dementia and depression.	2.3553530602380675
A 38-year-old male patient presented with circumscribed scleroderma (10x12 cm) in the left pectoral area.	2.4255996526867314
Hyperaemia of the skin in the area of the lilac ring (morphoea) was quantified by means of Laser-Doppler flux (LDF).	2.3115633325029967
At the lilac border of the morphoea LDF was increased to 420% of the reference value recorded for the unaffected skin of the contralateral side.	2.0493170085534715
Immediately after 13 days of antibiotic therapy (3x10 Mega penicillin G per day, i.v.)	2.283184145240574
LDF normalized, though clinical changes were hardly apparent at this stage.	2.1173364036387965
By 6 months later, LDF was still in the normal range, and clinical signs, such as induration and hyperaemic redness, had also significantly improved.	2.2617412657104596
LDF measurements allow assessment of the therapeutic response to antibiotic therapy at a very early stage while the clinical situation is still unchanged.	2.357686371954606
It is generally accepted that the progression of an idiopathic scoliotic deformity with a Cobb angle of between 25  ° and 40  ° can be stopped by brace treatment alone provided that the generally acknowledged criteria for the treatment concerning skeletal growth of the individual are respected.	2.0257751422441443
The total costs for a department of anaesthesia amount to a fraction of the total hospital budget that is proportional to the overall number of hospital departments; this means anaesthetic departments are in general not cost drivers.	1.8698137238913644
The medical treatment of erectile dysfunction includes the systemic (oral, epidermal, intramuscular) as well as the local (intracavernosal, intraurethral) application of pharma cological agents.	1.9689230015154615
Up to now only yohimbine, a well-known alpha-receptor blocking agent, and sildenafil, a newly introduced phosphodiesterase V inhibitor with predominant peripheral action, have been approved and listed in Germany.	1.9017157118978116
Other oral agents under investigation are trazodone and apomorphine (central action) as well as phentolamine (peripheral action).	2.14455209462462
For the small group of patients with an established testosterone deficit, the epidermal or intramuscular substitution of testosterone seems to be a reasonable alternative to other therapeutic options.	2.479857914790474
Currently, several promising pharmacological agents with different modes of action and routes of administration are under investigation.	1.9933730564613263
The ultimate goal of these basic and clinical research efforts is to develop a specific and "tailored" therapy for each individual patient.	2.115947225084132
While the pharmacological therapy of erectile dysfunction will most likely continue to be the therapeutic standard for most patients, it will certainly be augmented by devices (i. e. vacuum erection devices, "functional electromyostimulation of the corpus cavernosum", FEMCC) and surgical treatment options (vascular and prosthetic surgery).	1.9444948207396562
We treated a large superficial basal cell carcinoma (ca.	2.362995740338003
10x6 cm) on the right breast in a 48-year old woman with photodynamic terapy (PDT).	2.544766770545181
Fractionated PDT was performed by topical application of -aminolevulinic acid (-ALA, 20%) with subsequent red light (570-750 nm; 180 J/cm2) in three sessions.	2.0037308196422448
Nearly total remission of the tumor resulted; however, a few residual neoplastic islands partly infiltrating the nipple-areola complex could be detected by photodynamic diagnosis (PDD).	2.0913085943601426
These fluorescent areas were marked, excised, and the defect was closed by a rotation advancement flap.	2.3731100199879847
Total excision of the tumor was verified histologically.	3.331199837221388
By combining PDT and surgery, this large tumor was treated with excellent cosmetic results.	2.2148240730075353
This case demonstrates the efficiency of topical PDT with adjunctive plastic surgery controlled by PDD even in large tumors.	2.0229561648536833
In a prospective trial patients were interviewed in two periods, from 1988 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1995.	2.0228934652477704
Ninety out of 189 patients (47,6%) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant melanoma who noted morphological changes in a pigmented lesion reported the mole had been present at least 10 years.	2.1534544635628676
20,7% stated it was present since birth.	2.338439903100561
156 out of 189 patients (82,5%) noticed changes in the lesion over the time.	2.443346166103032
Growth, discolouration and elevation were the most frequent changes but no significant early sign of disease was found.	2.3208360511028356
Bleeding and crusting were found with tumor thickness >1,5 mm and thus be signs of an advanced stage.	2.250056049380752
Almost 6 months passed until half of the patients visited a physician, either because of changes in the mole or in the lesion was detected during other medical examinations.	2.459025719539284
In the second period of the survey from 1993 to 1995 the physician was frequently consulted earlier.	1.978362417028812
The main reasons for the delay between identification by the patient and seeking medical cedure were lack of symptoms and the notion that the lesion was harmless.	2.2857229423617684
Only 72 out of 189 patients (38,1%) visited the physician on their own initiative.	2.1150317278651802
The primary evaluation of the "pigmental lesion" was done by a primary care physician in 57%, by a dermatologist in 32% and by others in 11% of our cases.	2.1540710284457925
A diagnosis of a non-melanoma was made and no further steps were initiated by 27% of the primary care physicians and 22,7% of the surgeons, gynecologists or internists.	2.2737698714990477
Only 5% of the dermatologists misdiagnosed the lesions.	2.5033691206540247
Whereas 83,2% of the patients first evaluated by dermatologists had a surgical removal of the mole within the first 2 months after consultation, the proportion for those diagnosed by non-dermatologists was only 58,5%.	2.312737613050221
The rate of primary treatment by surgeons, often with a small safety margin, also increased.	2.1446722540472245
In 45 patients with Parkinson's disease, we investigated coping behavior and its correlations to demographic and disease-related data, locus of control, depression, and psychosocial adaptation.	2.1970653220863334
Active, problem oriented, and self-reorganizing strategies were predominantly used and regarded as especially helpful by the 27 men and 18 women (age: 56 years; duration of illness: 9 years).	1.8773865534980099
While age and sex were not associated with coping, external locus of control correlated positively to "depressive coping" and duration of illness correlated negatively to "distraction and self-affirmation."	2.0641444976971615
Coping strategies regarded as maladaptive and a small degree of internal locus of control correlated to unfavourable results for depression and satisfaction.	1.944462565572311
The Internet has become a powerful, international source for information, and it has shown an exponential growth because of the ease of access and the immediate availability of information.	2.15446461604166
We introduced a new ophthalmological atlas including ICD coding on the World Wide Web.	1.9708014446131308
So far, more than 500 lantern slides of typical and interesting ophthalmological findings have been selected and digitized.	2.034144829110139
These pictures were integrated in a data base, which was arranged for ease and speed of search and retrieval.	2.1702070439320478
In its background, the data base contains a list of over 4700 ICD-encoded diagnoses to which the picture-documented findings are linked.	2.0212004293671053
Comments on pictures can be added by the author or by users.	2.1360857392547192
The data base contains several lists, such as a list of ICD codes and diagnoses, a list of all pictures with corresponding diagnoses, a list of all diagnoses and number of picture, a list of those diagnoses for which the corresponding picture is available, as well as a list of comments on each picture.	2.0998624976030835
Special program scripts handle the user's search key words for diagnoses and extract the required information out of the data base, using Windows NT.	1.9776987051116137
Search results are presented on an automatically built-up webpage.	2.3040964077287427
To provide fast speed of search all pictures initially are shown in a small format (thumbnails) with little amount of data.	1.9824814302001137
The related full-size picture is retrieved by a single mouse click.	2.09479221303739
Moreover, the name and institution of the author, diagnostical hints and comments on pictures by the author or by users are offered for each diagnosis available.	1.7591892786350811
The Giessen Ophthalmological Picture Atlas can be reached in the Internet.	2.2226741249245507
It allows a fast search free of charge from all over the world and, therefore, offers an additional option to obtain specific ophthalmological information for various purposes.	1.9752199272912405
Even though the function of the myometrium is vital for the existence of all mammals, there is little knowledge about its ultrastructure.	2.3410026910130584
So far, only the contractile filaments actin and myosin have been identified.	2.204540621922007
There is no evidence for the existence of other filament systems, either my means of electron microscopy or histochemically.	2.141043477881092
The indications, operative procedure, postoperative complications and advantages of laparoscopic ileostomy and colostomy as compared with "open" enterostomy are described and demonstrated in our own patients with Crohn's disease.	2.157922150334697
Major indications for laparoscopic enterostomy in patients with Crohn's disease are stenosis, fecal incontinence and complex anal fistulas in those with severe Crohn's proctitis.	2.1633864550253743
Most Crohn patients tolerate laparoscopic enterostomy and an increasing number demand this minimally invasive technique.	2.117150477196362
The period of convalescence is much shorter and complications in connection with laparotomy are minimized.	2.2611504493940946
We report on a complete longitudinal rupture of the urethra in combination with a rupture of the pubic symphysis and pelvic fracture during spontaneous vaginal delivery.	2.2882634867391074
Three weeks later after removing of the transurethral catheter a mild stress incontinence could be observed.	1.9585062787125465
In the follow up one year later the patient was completely continent.	2.7154873364454537
The cosmetic result was satisfactory.	2.4183835884242884
An unclear haematuria after delivery needs a meticulous urological examination.	2.086895329694334
Early repair of urethral disruption minimize the risk of severe incontinence.	2.5396614720152577
Coordinated care between the trauma surgeon and urologist is required for successful treatment of this rare combined injury after birth.	2.162012285351374
The increased consumption of "ecstasy" (MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) has also increased the number of life-threatening intoxications.	2.27247490475811
From a Medline search of the years 1992-1996, reports were registered and evaluated.	2.118315782757304
Besides cerebral, cardiorespiratory, renal, and hepatic symptoms, hyperthermia syndromes such as malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or the serotonin syndrome were common.	1.8873886009374532
In addition to a discussion of the intoxication symptoms and their acute and intensive-care therapy, the psychological and physiological effects of "ecstasy" will be described.	2.0563519118259186
Some historical considerations of the topic are included in this review.	2.349660913053727
The goal of this prospective, randomised and double-blind pilot-study was to investigate the analgesic potency and the side-effects of tramadol enantiomers in clinical practice.	2.352821925294529
One hundred patients recovering from orthopaedic surgery with a postoperative pain intensity of more than 50 on a visual analogue scale 0-100 mm (Table 1) were recruited for the study.	2.258214721188066
They were treated in a randomised, double-blind way with a maximal dose of 150 mg i.v.	2.1621390737996755
(+)-, (-)-tramadol, racemate, or 15 mg i.v.	2.088674457785872
morphine or saline in the placebo group (5 groups, 20 patients each).	2.3237189973333994
The primary criterium of efficacy was the number of responders defined as patients with a pain reduction of at least 20 on VAS after 40 min.	2.4491443921056653
In case of pain, responders were allowed to continue with the double-blind drug up to six hours.	2.209884869376442
The non-responders were treated with morphine as the rescue analgesic.	2.498003121598368
The secondary criterium was the incidence and severity of side-effects.	2.6414754715792634
Six patients terminated the study prematurely.	2.384757772635456
One patient was excluded because of an allergic reaction to morphine, one patient could not be treated sufficiently with morphine, four were excluded because of protocol violations.	2.1625672896463075
There were 8 responders in the (+)-tramadol-, 6 in the (-)-tramadol- and 6 in the racemate group, 16* (P<0,05) in the morphine group, and 5 in the placebo group.	2.231929838553565
Pain intensity after 40 min was reduced by 20 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 36 (p<0,01 vs placebo, p<0,05 vs (+)-, (-)-tramadol, and racemate group) and 5 mm on the VAS in the (+)-, (-)-, (+/-)-tramadol-, morphine- and placebo-group, respectively.	1.9147116897332193
Thirty eight adverse events like nausea, vomiting, PCO2-increase, and urinary retention occurred in 20 patients, most frequently in the (+)-tramadol- and morphine group.	2.1359897928937883
Sedation was significantly less profound in the (-)-tramadol group 1-4 h postoperatively.	2.2726541908040723
There were no side-effect in the tramadol racemate group.	2.3125849394233815
The enantiomers were equal to the racemate in analgesic potency, but inferior by far to morphine.	2.071805647647316
They showed more adverse events and, hence, can not be preferred to the racemate in postoperative pain therapy.	2.2806426352880274
A 36-year-old man known as chronic alcohol abuser presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral petriefied kidneys by sonography and computed tomography.	1.9452379340389194
Because of an unclear renal failure a kidney biopsy was performed and presented typical chronic renal oxalosis with massive oxalate crystal deposits, tubular atrophy and interstitital fibrosis.	1.887914382984234
Since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before, a secondary oxalosis was supposed.	1.9312550081713666
The subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of rocket fuel with cola lemonade 12 years before during the patient's army time as a marine soldier.	1.747154289395772
The presented case, however, suggests a rare sublethal ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage, oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure.	1.8648125586344868
Undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the patient died 5 months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure.	2.4782617898873966
At autopsy, progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed.	2.28328538004951
Decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension.	1.9004102552100508
Insulinomas are rare tumors and account for 90 % of all endocrine pancreatic tumors.	2.3859898338347683
They typically present as a solitary tumor, but may occur in multiple sites (e.g.	2.2899706216122584
multiple endocrine neoplasia type I) or as a malignant disease in 10 % of cases and rarely as nesidioblastosis or islet cell adenomatosis.	2.270581525397262
Neuroglucopenic symptoms lead to the diagnosis; inadequate high insulin and C-peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the fasting test confirm the diagnosis.	2.1401585763946227
Preoperative localization is not necessary prior to the first operation.	2.9073641978878038
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia with a high risk of recurrence is problematic.	2.4041963017341113
Subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be better than selective tumor resection.	2.567920245772239
In malignant insulinomas, mostly presenting with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with hepatectomy and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are the modalities of choice.	1.9216093718585938
MR spectroscopy is the only method for non-invasive detection of various aspects of cardiac metabolism in humans.	2.5536604833072363
While the 1H nucleus of water and fat molecules is the signal source for MR imaging, the MR spectroscopic technique allows for the study of a number of other nuclei, such as 13C, 19F, 23Na, 31P, 39K and 87Rb.	1.9691085517157503
Clinical applications presently are confined to the 31P nucleus.	2.2328609254256846
31P-MR spectroscopy allows the non-invasive study of cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolites ATP and phosphocreatine.	2.2830217809904028
The phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is considered an index of the energetic state of the heart.	2.338370750618115
Possible clinical indications include heart failure, valve disease and coronary artery disease.	2.4533700119695694
In heart failure, the phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is reduced and correlates with clinical severity, ejection fraction and prognosis.	2.1459352595593604
In mitral and aortic valve disease, a reduced phosphocreatine/ATP ratio may indicate the optimum timing for valve replacement.	2.0880489394403865
In coronary artery disease, a regional decrease of phosphocreatine during stress ("biochemical ergometry") may indicate local ischemia.	2.136069289963092
Furthermore, absolute quantification of high-energy phosphates may allow diagnosis of myocardial viability.	2.255762757506923
Major technical developments, leading to improved spatial and temporal resolution will be necessary to establish MR spectroscopy as a routine clinical tool.	2.26620380358848
A retrospective and partly prospective study was conducted to analyse both clinically and cephalometrically the craniofacial growth pattern of patients with isolated and syndrome-related premature craniosynostosis after standardized fronto-orbital and midface advancement.	2.094230589905661
In addition, lateral teleradiographies of 117 patients from this group were cephalometrically analysed.	1.9527752834510257
Moreover, late results of 36 children and  8 adults with midface-advancement with an average follow-up period of 4.5 years were assessed.	2.122657311018289
In contrast to linear craniectomy and so-called lateral canthal advancement, in only 8.2% of cases (24 out of 293 patients) were relapses requiring reoperation found in this study after fronto-orbital advancement.	1.9989788785053373
The evaluations indicate that with simple forms of craniosynostosis such as trigonocephaly and plagiocephaly predominantly very good or good growth can be observed.	1.8885387492065366
Cephalometric evaluation confirmed the limited potential of growth in the area of the anterior skull base and in the midface in the presence of syndrome-related faciocraniosynostoses.	2.64032257418338
In such cases the cephalometrically confirmed maxillary hypoplasia, which increases in severity in the following order of syndromes `Saethre-Chotzen-Crouzon-Apert-Pfeiffer', could be influenced only to a limited degree by fronto-orbital advancement.	1.751905026002118
For this reason midface advancement is of secondary importance in children with very severe anomalies.	2.1902971765558736
In the present evaluation, a high rate of relapse of midfacial hypoplasia was to be found in children and adolescents after this operation in accordance with other references.	2.440848489372308
Therefore, the indication for Le Fort III osteotomy in the growth period should be limited.	2.1074337731745367
The introduction of Perfluorochemicals into medicine and especially into the treatment of severe lung injury is a fascinating scientific task.	2.242755369973854
Many recall the famous experiments from Clark et al.	2.076426245966739
in 1966 when he demonstrated "liquidventilation with perfluorocarbons" in the mammal species for the first time.	1.94739209951094
After this hallmark, perfluorocarbons were subsequently introduced in research of acute lung injury by the techniques of Total- and Partial-Liquid-Ventilation (TLV; PLV).	1.77352066411206
Perfluorocarbons (saturated organofluorids) have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for intraalveolar application.	1.8184860801439586
The strong C-F bindings in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability, biochemical inertness, high capacity to dissolve respiratory gases, low surface tension and high vapor pressures.	1.7839865598819353
Furthermore, the high density of the PFC lead to radio-opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas.	1.9428521459776842
The efficacy of PFC liquid, applied by TLV/PLV has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury.	1.997298449216704
Currently, several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed: recruitment of atelectatic alveoli, prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli ("liquid PEEP"), redistribution of perfusion, oxygen transport, surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation.	1.8205084548841848
Since total liquid ventilation has been used only in experimental models of lung injury, partial liquid ventilation has been introduced successfully into clinical trials (phase I-II).	2.141081050788084
However, the results of the first randomised, controlled study of PLV in 90 adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure (ALI/ARDS) showed no differences between PLV and conventional treatment.	2.290920021144677
Furthermore, the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as liquithoraces, pneumothoraces and hypoxia.	1.9359655967258502
Since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen, the application of liquids, even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic.	1.9758652000352384
To overcome these unwanted side effects, we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents.	2.2366895219309693
After resolving some technical issues, this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury.	2.143130888889444
Vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of 18 Vol.% of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance.	1.928951063761568
Though these results are promising, mechanisms of action, dose-efficacy relation, surfactant-perfluorocarbon interaction or anti-inflammatory effects of vaporised perfluorohexane are still unclear.	1.949040643883105
These questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically.	2.5105799835338587
However, the inhalation of vapor, a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space.	1.7678035553064146
Furthermore, this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing, continuous monitoring, and demand application in a way near to clinical routine.	2.030789465017243
VDD pacing using a single pass lead for complete heart block is well described in adults but there are few reports of its use in children.	2.10341613165925
We have used 6 different standard adult size single pass leads and 5 different pacemaker generators in 21 children and adolescents aged 3.7-17.2 years (mean 9.9 years) and weighing 13.5 to 76 kg (mean 34.3 kg).	1.7939349136716973
Congenital complete heart block was present in 14 patients (with associated heart disease in 2 of them), surgical complete heart block in 6 patients and 2:1 AV block of uncertain cause in 1 patient.	2.154064766711875
In 10 patients, the VDD system was their first pacing system.	2.3488709326943797
In 11 of the patients, 1-6 previous systems had been used and simultaneous extraction of ventricular leads (10) and/or atrial leads (5) was performed.	2.662176670694843
All leads were introduced via a subclavian vein puncture (using the extraction sheath when present) and the atrial dipole was placed low in the right atrium to provide slack for further growth while maintaining atrial sensing.	1.964983568188884
Ventricular thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 V. The minimal atrial amplitude was 0.7 to 4 mV and the maximum amplitude was 2.5 to 8 mV.	1.803756687553421
There was one early micro-displacement and the lead was repositioned.	2.0128822993748328
Over a follow-up period of 2-64 months (mean 32 months), all but 1 of the patients have maintained low ventricular pacing thresholds and adequate atrial signals for reliable pacing at rest and with exercise.	2.3399437521671373
During this time some have undergone considerable growth.	2.2592717271109626
In 1 patient, atrial sensing was lost after cardiopulmonary bypass for additional cardiac surgery at 24 months and the pacemaker was programmed into VVIR mode.	1.929981716037244
One patient with coexisting congenital heart disease died suddenly at 3 years but the pacing system had no fault at autopsy.	1.918759417775336
The standard adult size single pass lead provides a simple means to enable reliable atrial synchronous ventricular pacing in growing children with complete heart block.	1.8956705472429443
Open reduction with internal stabilization is considered to be the standard therapy for the treatment of displaced acetabular fractures.	2.895567890204439
The internal fixation is routinely achieved by the use of plates and screws.	2.626657913345228
The use of cerclage wires and cables as a reduction aid and definitive implant for stabilization has only occasionally been reported in the literature.	1.8744690750107431
The indication was mostly limited to use in elderly patients with insufficient bone stock.	2.3359088872810982
A newly instrument developed on the basis of a standard bone elevator is presented.	2.3105582897037924
It allows a safe, semiclosed application of a cerclage wire around the greater ischiatic notch through use of the second window of the ilioinguinal approach.	2.0771982032984195
A wide dissection at the "outside" of the pelvis is not necessary.	2.330810113517797
A 35 year old patient developed swellings in the red colored areas of his tattoo.	2.250007599347472
Histological examination revealed a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous infiltrative pattern, that could be distinguished from frank lymphoma by means of electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology.	2.2132310169352123
The presence of dermal dendritic cells suggests a dermal-allergic pathogenesis of non-granulomatous tattoo reactions.	2.0398300890560197
Therapy of choice is an excision of the inflamed areas.	2.6312246028689743
Interventional duct occlusion is increasingly performed with detachable coils.	2.2731183337875005
In a series of 33 patients (34 procedures), we consistently used Gianturco-coils which were the initially employed coils.	2.0896018314689653
They are not securable but can be implanted in a simple manner.	2.3835590657379786
The rate of embolization was high (28 %) in the first 14 procedures; however, it declined to 5 % in the last 20 patients.	2.603369191201623
We modified the technique by partially blocking the duct, when necessary, with a catheter which was advanced from the pulmonary artery and by implanting up to three coils.	2.176209643824486
There was only one embolization and one small residual shunt in the last 20 patients.	2.1318814675147535
Considering our experience, we continue to recommend the use of Gianturco-coils especially in the small duct which can be closed quickliy at low cost.	2.4439545659441957
This review presents data supporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in depressive illness.	2.2924605645968095
Neuroanatomical research, animal research and clinical studies have shown that a dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system could be associated with depressive symptoms.	2.3269763658810683
Furthermore, the chronic administration of antidepressants in animals provokes a sensitisation and enhanced expression of dopaminergic receptors.	1.8800043098497374
Although the dopaminergic system has received little attention in biological research on depression in the last decades, current research on the dopaminergic system is about to change this situation.	2.1085446361024647
Athletes who need high endurance capacity often use training at moderately high altitude (1500-3000 m) to improve oxygen delivery and utilization because of a hypoxia-induced increase of the red blood cell volume and adaptations at the muscular level.	1.9020212962560363
As maximal heart rates decrease at high altitude and plasma lactate levels for a given workload change during prolonged exposure to high altitude, it can be difficult to control and adapt the intensity and duration of the work-outs.	2.1131155842292872
Furthermore, maximal performance capacity decreases and therefore training intensity at high altitude is usually reduced compared to training at sea level.	1.8784311886136753
To avoid these disadvantages at high altitude a concept of living at moderately high altitude and training at lower elevations, termed "live high - train low" evolved, opposing the conventional concept of "live high - train high".	1.772295082730115
A third option using a hypobaric chamber ("live low - train low") is hardly used anymore for training athletes.	1.8705600655185928
Studies on the effects of conventional high-altitude training for the improvement of athletic performance often lack a rigorous controlled design and yield controversial results.	1.9848118937240413
Regarding the new concept of "live high - train low" there is only one controlled study on college athletes and it shows a minor advantage of this new approach compared to conventional high-altitude training.	1.9548009207850747
However, training concepts are especially important for elite competitive athletes, and controlled studies with such individuals are very difficult to perform.	2.0678130637456635
Therefore, it appears that today we cannot answer the question of whether altitude-specific physiologic factors or non-altitude-related benefits of training camps account for the success of individual athletes.	2.1028484634705222
Purpose: To answer the following questions: whether reliable detection of lesions is possible in low-field-MRI-system (Magnetom Open 0.2 T) equipped with currently available hard- and software components in comparison to high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T).	1.9658449790414607
Furthermore, whether localization of lesions suspect in MR-mammography can be realized in MR system of low field (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	1.9166811129896864
Patients and Methods: In 11 patients, suspect lesions were diagnosed in diagnostic MR-mammography acquired with high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) and were compared to low field MR-mammographies of 0.2 T (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	1.8602646359789379
In six of the 11 patients a suspect lesion was localized using wire marking.	2.0741392467618915
Results: All lesions considered suspect in diagnostic MR-mammography (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) were also clearly identified in the 0.2 T system (Magnetom Open).	1.957975341678953
Due to its open construction permitting permanent access to the breast and due to sufficient image quality, the Magnetom Open is suitable for interventions on the breast.	2.0196118742222375
Children with limb deficiencies or amputations of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand or to walk according to their state of development, because just standing and walking are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration.	2.111130928419962
Supply them with a prosthesis, orthesis and orthoprosthesis is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation.	2.097389776346505
While a prosthesis replaces parts of the extremities, orthesis stabilizes the existing extremity.	2.330708278500283
Orthoprostheses compensate longitudinal malformations, have a supporting effect, allow growth to be controlled and compensate for shortening.	2.059260972470877
Just as important as the remedy is early medical treatment.	2.196454701673415
The sooner the treatment starts, the better the results.	2.261289948584348
As a result of the present experiences with the inhalative application of nitric oxide (NO) in term babies now the first promising reports about NO application in preterm babies have been published.	2.0363812981821505
HIV remains infectious at room temperature for about six to twelve hours under sterile conditions, the time is shorter in the presence of bacteria and when clotting occurs.	2.114832161888488
HIV infectivity is easily destroyed by disinfectants.	2.2926300756348486
The human infectious dose of HIV is around 100 to 1000 particles, dependent on the virus and the site of entry into the host.	2.0551455995662264
After inoculation new HIV is produced after 24 hours, and HIV has spread over the whole organism by the end of one or two weeks.	2.316677132044549
HIV infection may be detected after four to twelve weeks by antibody assays, and after eleven days by nucleic acid based assays.	2.0544520929222285
Anti-HIV production might be slowed down under initial therapy.	2.0381479892065055
In addition to psychiatric outpatient treatment, the detoxification of alcoholics in psychiatric hospitals is an important link between medical detoxification and psychosocial inpatient treatment aiming at abstinence.	1.9835658189990146
Integrated models of inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy focus on improvement of the motivation of patients towards further treatment of their alcoholism and towards abstinence.	2.041882378376411
In our study 529 alcoholics underwent such treatment lasting between 2 to 3 weeks.	1.9849110931872687
A total of 469 patients (89%) were followed up after 8  months; 242 alcoholics (52% of the follow-up sample; 46% of the whole sample) achieved the treatment goal and started further treatment, mainly as inpatients.	2.0239812881936308
Fifty-four of these patients relapsed before they started further alcoholism treatment, but achieved abstinence afterwards; 60 (25%) of these 242 patients relapsed after the specific alcoholism therapy; 227 alcoholics did not start further treatment after the initial detoxification and motivation therapy.	1.8790937872527311
In this subpopulation, 113 (50%) relapsed during the follow-up period.	2.224136684072416
Although this is not a controlled study, it can be concluded that integrated inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy has positive effects on the treatment behavior of alcoholic patients and enhances the probability of further abstinence.	2.2314966961600518
In this article we report a very rare case of simultaneous and bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendon in a 38-year-old patient.	2.3198663628772516
The initial diagnosis was "herniated vertebral disk".	2.203110916624514
Although there was an extensive neurological and psychiatric examination in combination with several operations, it took almost 3 months until the real reason was found.	2.178455147023282
In this case report we describe our postoperative treatment of early mobilization and compare it with other therapies.	2.038127725370249
Neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus, also known as thymic carcinoids, are rare tumors of the anterior mediastinum.	2.823377748604432
They occur sporadically or in association with the MEN I syndrome.	2.3562666274675834
We present five patients (four male, one female; age of first manifestation 19-53 years) who were operated on at our hospital between 1984 and 1995 for neuroendocrine thymic tumors.	2.060306502043362
A hormone-producing tumor presented with Cushing's syndrome in two patients.	2.1954435646212263
Two patients had MEN I syndrome.	2.2621642390459797
Only in the female patient the primary tumor was confined to the thymus.	2.463504627165841
We found lymph node metastases in three patients and a distant metastasis in one.	2.42186992237168
The neuroendocrine tumors have a high rate of local recurrences and thus we performed 11 operations using a transthoracic or transsternal approach.	2.0872182148930434
Since there was no operative mortality and adjuvant therapies are of limited value, we recommend surgery even in case of recurrence.	2.442654911569551
Korsakoff's psychosis (Wernicke-Korsakoff-Syndrome) following severe, long-term  alcoholism is considered to be widely resistent to treatment.	2.242273323283815
We report two cases with beneficial effects of treatment by a combination of clonidine and fluvoxamine.	2.3574766557659332
The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was based on the neuroleptical blockade of central dopamine D2 receptors.	2.372463034513714
Brain imaging studies, however, generally failed to demonstrate a significant increase in central D2 receptors among schizophrenic patients.	2.5671788278651912
Using a novel approach, the group of Laruelle and Abi-Dargham was now able to demonstrate that schizophrenic patients have increased synaptic dopamine concentrations in the striatum.	2.1120587766542656
Endogenous dopamine competes with a radioligand for binding at dopamine D2 receptors; compared to healthy control subjects, blockade of dopamine production in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients induced a significantly higher increase in D2 binding of the infused radioligand, indicating higher endogenous synaptic dopamine.	1.7286908708519606
A similar increase in D2 binding was also observed in drug-free schizophrenics who had previously been treated with neuroleptics; these patients also showed an increased density of striatal D2 receptors, most likely due to counteradaptive upregulation of D2 receptors during neuroleptic medication.	1.8606297276436286
The Columbia study provides an important indication of hyperdopaminergic function in schizophrenia.	2.1936916229110017
Multiple and bilateral oncocytomas are rare.	2.5108919987834124
There are only ten cases that have been previously described.	2.2952851839043804
Three of these displayed multiple and bilateral oncocytomas and microoncocytomas, a so-called oncocytomatosis.	2.16778378858595
This report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy.	2.482775571328518
In the distal renal tubules we found oncocytic epithelial cells, with partial transition into microoncocytomas.	2.0189022607702793
Immunhistochemically, these and the main oncocytomas were CD 10 negative.	2.2450236566605297
These findings support the origin of oncocytoma from oncocytically transformed distal tubular epithelium.	2.086736767193989
CGH analysis of the different tumors revealed no common cytogenetic changes.	2.909187024155852
Coexistence of renal oncocytoma with other tumors is rare.	2.2762765401973457
Hitherto, coexistence of a renal oncocytomatosis with multiple tumors has not been described.	2.3141042562290144
Thyroid disorders in childhood needing surgery are rare.	2.414815431652733
Therapeutical procedures therefore are derived from adult surgery with modifications to meet the specific need of the pediatric patient.	2.056146080364101
The indications for operation are presented with regard to incidence and type of the defect, and the surgical procedures with regard to the extent of the lesion results.	3.2172942997342022
Malignant bone tumors require the same careful staging as, for example, lung cancer.	2.340220663972512
However, well-established staging systems for non-osseous tumors are not suitable for bone tumors.	2.3531944181259328
Therefore we present Enneking's staging system for malign bone tumors here, which is better adapted to the special problems of these entities because it integrates clinical, radiological and histological findings.	2.191543656311572
The weak points of Enneking's staging system (e.g.	2.1708682907574754
inflexibility, changes in radiological modalities in the past 20 years) are discussed.	2.639271497095506
Efficient analgesia may be the major objective in the cardiovascular risk patient following myocardial infarction, acute occlusion of peripheral vessels, or dissection/perforation of major abdominal vessels.	2.1073496388851645
It was the purpose of the study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight different opioids in 57 circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular surgery.	2.5600037815719667
Patients were randomly allocated to eight groups, each receiving a different opioid within a clinical, equipotent dose range (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, pethidine, tramadol, alfentanil).	1.743332028909176
A complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to as well as 5, 10, 15, and 20 min following opioid administration.	2.374706373090828
Monitoring included a complete invasive haemodynamic and blood gas status.	2.2274327288076172
Statistical evaluation was performed by 1- and 2-factorial ANOVA (P<0.05).	2.3527406376885107
Significant time effects (changes from baseline at the time of measurement) were observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance, while significant group (group-specific differences in the course of values at the different times of measurements) and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, stroke volume index, and PaO2.	2.0773513842338023
No major effects were observed following morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, tramadol, and nalbuphine.	2.2666999945277477
Buprenorphine caused distinct respiratory depression accompanied by an increase in pulmonary vascular tone.	2.4780174297215067
Pentazocine and pethidine caused a significant increase in MPAP and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine also produced marked respiratory depression.	2.027397269007384
For interpretation of the results, factors such as respiratory depression, histamine release, secretion of endogenous catecholamines, and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have to be discussed.	2.2341435479377583
Tramadol, an opioid with moderate potency, seems to offer some advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects.	2.101317009389205
In this article we report a case of an early postoperative compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial compartment with complete sensomotoric palsy of the peroneal nerve after arthroscopic-assisted replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee.	2.331550915374427
The tourniquet pressure was 360 mm Hg and operation time was 1.75 h. After the operation the leg was bandaged to avoid swelling of the leg and as antithrombotic prophylaxis.	2.068959229820817
Increasing pain of the lower leg was suppressed by additional analgesia.	2.6509852329104704
Due to persistent pain despite regular analgesia, the patient was sent to a main hospital on the 3rd postoperative day, where an extremely painful and swollen anterior tibial compartment with intracompartimental pressure of over 100 mm Hg was found.	1.9816763608544854
The compartment was released immediately.	2.5026740860782333
Despite the appearance of severe muscle damage, no extensive débridement was done.	2.3342680586114986
At the second examination, at 48 h, there was minimal perfusion of the muscles without contraction and islands of ischemic necrosis.	2.1026083623036724
Clinically, there was complete palsy of the dorsiflexors of the foot.	2.4463660815694315
Continuous epidural analgesia masks the classic symptoms of compartment syndrome.	2.18095743831282
The influence of biomechanics in surgery of the locomotor apparatus has been constantly increasing over the last few decades.	2.1611708775688365
The purpose of this study was to determine wether biomechanical studies can significantly influence therapy and treatment of shoulder injuries, especially shoulder instability.	2.1047379346774666
The investigation was performed on 23 fresh human specimens with intact capsular ligaments of the glenohumeral joint.	2.0730987421855893
A Bankart lesion from 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock was repaired, and a Bankart repair and anterior inferior capsular shift, as described by Neer, were performed.	1.9327320273008082
The measurement was done on six clinically relevant positions of instability: superior, anterior, anterior-inferior, inferior, posterior-inferior, posterior.	1.9159107979195493
Measurement was done using a specially developed strain-gauge system.	2.1762108875272212
It was demonstrated that both instability and too much stability of the shoulder joint lead to a significant change in shoulder biomechanics.	2.446864521597907
The anatomical 0-position of the glenohumeral joint in 110  ° of abduction is a position of about 60  ° of external rotation compared to the 0-position for clinical measurement.	2.195379298587561
From the therapy point of view, one has to ask for anatomical reconstruction instead of tight repair in soft-tissue repair in the glenohumeral joint.	2.0526327799499873
Immediate post-operative rehabilitation in a 60  ° range of motion is possible.	2.5885893524777153
A total of 61 patients suffering from weight loss and epigastric pain were screened by color flow Duplex imaging (CFDJ) of the abdominal vessels.	2.2550422544647004
Criteria for diagnosis were (1) peak flow in the celiac axis (CA) of more than 200 cm/s; (2) fixing of the CA stenosis during expiration and inspiration, and (3) steal phenomenon and reversal of flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).	2.1951449126598694
Results: Of 61 patients 21 (34.4%) fulfilled the criteria; 38 (62.3%) were excluded, and 2 patients could not be evaluated.	2.085643229998749
Of 21 patients 10 were operated on after confirming diagnosis by angiography of CA and SMA.	2.150244918520804
After a follow-up of 28 months 80% of the operated patients were free of symptoms, 10% improved, and 10% showed no change.	2.6110117013018557
Conclusion: Successful operative treatment of CA compression includes (1) CFDJ of CA and SMA proving stenosis persisting in inspirational position of the diaphragm; (2) angiography of CA and SMA showing a steal phenomenon including blood flow reversal in SMA; (3) triad of symptoms: epigastric pain, postprandial pain and weight loss; and (4) exclusion of other causes, i.e.	2.029197026988898
pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis etc.	2.686376179206137
Extremely radical and radical surgical treatment of breast cancer was investigated with regard to indication, prognosis and local recurrence in comparison to current standard breast-conserving procedures.	2.668173134926375
Plastic-reconstructive techniques and innovative therapeutical approaches such as preoperative chemotherapy can extend the indications for breast-conserving therapy without loss of oncological safety.	2.0300429240676947
Choosing individually various oncoplastic techniques such as glandular adaptation, local or distant flaps or mammoplasty permits breast remodeling with excellent cosmetic results.	1.8223832238650646
We present the variety of intraglandular techniques and local flaps that enable the breast surgeon to achieve good symmetry and breast shape with minimal surgery and scarring.	1.9041492228163222
Lesions detected in the white matter by T2-weighted MRI are often inadvertently attributed to multiple sclerosis (MS).	2.107461527464164
Patients with rheumatic diseases are commonly treated as an outpatient in their local environment or are referred to specialized centers.	2.0645583475631337
Two recently founded daypatient clinics in Berlin and Frankfurt/Rhein-Main (Germany) for patients suffering from rheumatic diseases will be evaluated for their medical outcome and cost-effectivness of comprehensive treatment of RA patients in stages of high inflammatory activity and progressive disability.	1.8787686766198355
The study design will be prospective, controlled, and randomized to compare outpatient and daypatient treatment.	1.9811251140373323
The case-control study design with matched pairs within the network of collaborative arthritis centers will be used to compare daypatient and inpatient treatment.	1.9183460845815261
The paper contains a review of studies published in English or German language dealing with daypatient treatment of RA patients.	2.0541895860827513
A case of atrial ectopic tachycardia in an infant probably caused by a small tumor in the interatrial septum is presented.	2.14920070994492
The arrhythmia was successfully treated with amiodarone.	2.63465646959357
Several histologic abnormalities are known to cause AET, but an intracardiac tumor detectable by two-dimensional echocardiography is extremely rare.	2.1053034532003396
AET - especially in childhood - as well as cardiac tumors show a tendency to regression, so that even in this case medical treatment should be the first therapeutic choice.	2.7597310013416116
Interventional or surgical treatment is required just for those patients with AET that is resistant to medical treatment or reoccurs after finishing the medical treatment.	2.1261240229956004
Tonsure trichotillomania is a subtype of trichotillomania in which the scalp exhibits a tonsural pattern of alopecia over the crown, extending to the frontal margin and sparing the lateral margins and the nape of the neck.	1.9657770409483226
It differs from to the more common form of childhood trichotillomania in that predominantly female adolescents are affected and its incidence is related to quite severely pathologic psychodynamics, often with a disturbed relationship to female sexuality.	1.8575799872519692
The treating physician should be more guarded in assessing the prognosis; hair plucking often continues for years.	2.0281270217412612
Two patients with tonsure alopecia, associated in one case with trichotillomania of the pubic hair and in the other with enuresis, are presented.	2.301161043282164
The aim of the following study was to develop an osteoporotic model by means of ovariectomy.	2.7905793385484055
Bone mineral density of the upper and lower jaw was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DPX) before and after ovariectomy.	2.2728745948400912
Histomorphometric measurements were done by a microtomography system.	2.5286650533574275
Bone mineral density decreased significantly after ovariectomy in the upper and lower jaw.	2.298692806432659
There is evidence for the community effectiveness of preventive geriatric intervention programs prior to the need for help or long-term care from a couple of prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs).	2.195989937515388
For geriatric rehabilitation programs tailored to older people with imminent or manifest need for long-term care analogous - evidence is still lacking.	2.0424721915197694
The nation-wide leading boards of the FRG's Sickness Insurance Administration in conjunction with its Central Medical Service have formulated guidelines for the formation of a nation-wide ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to realize the postulate of the long-term care insurance legislation "rehabilitation prior to long-term care".	1.9644863141967364
These guidelines must be proven empirically.	2.4544745232000906
To prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the foreseen ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service, the RCT design would be highly desirable.	1.9998193081900186
Unfortunately, the prerequisites in the field of methodology are poor since valid, reproducible and feasible criteria for the selection of suitable patients and measurement criteria which meet the requirement of proven medium-term sensitivity to change do not yet exist.	1.9924863062769265
Nevertheless, there is a great and urgent need, for the first time, to investigate the cost-effectiveness ratio for this ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to be established in the FRG, leaving aside the methodologic desiderata of randomized control-groups.	2.1929472862039674
"Idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia is an exclusion diagnosis.	2.4059235770561056
The underlying reasons and mechanisms of "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardias are still not completely understood.	2.1522510703928415
Recent investigations showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the right ventricle of patients with "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia out of the right ventricular outflow tract, which could often be correlated with the origin of the ventricular tachycardia.	2.9034923923875224
These described abnormalities were not uniform.	2.493161706122497
Here we report about a patient suffering from drug-refractory "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia for 10 years.	2.2925386835451294
This is the first report in which the origin of an "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia could be localized by right-ventricular angiography, magnetic resonance tomography and electrophysiological study in the area of an interventricular septal thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract and cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation.	2.252183951747174
Fetal teratomas are extra- or intracorporal congenital malformations with different localization.	2.0647196615482892
Although they are rare, they may provoke severe obstetrical complications if they are not prenatally diagnosed.	2.3046246560331527
If sonographic examination of fetal teratomas is performed, it is necessary to evaluate the further development of pregnancy for fetal outcome and pregnancy aspects in relationship to the localization, size and ultrasound criteria of the tumor.	2.424978158326019
Sonographic findings reveal the criteria and conditions for conservative or invasive management or reasons for continuing or terminating the pregnancy.	1.9325565490747794
Prenatal ultrasound examination is the only possibility to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, as exemplified by 8 prenatally examined fetal teratomas.	2.2191520459096723
We report on a 62-year-old female patient with melena in which polypoid lesions of the cecum were discovered endoscopically.	2.1283281066540716
Histological examination of mucosal biopsies revealed an inflammatory process with lots of histiocytes and so-called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, leading to the diagnosis of a malakoplakia of the colon.	2.242759189961917
No other organs were found affected.	2.469011603215175
In the course of an antibiotic therapy, there was no melena detectable over a period of six months.	2.671879887923461
Malakoplakia, an inflammation usually affecting the urogenital tract, is rarely found in the colon, with only 35 cases published until now.	2.194044543256262
It is frequently associated with other diseases like neoplastic or inflammatory disorders, immune defect syndromes or heroin abuse.	1.967618989484814
This spectrum is expanded by our report in which a long-standing alcohol abuse was found as an attendant disease.	2.223622868707261
Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem a (ULE) is a self-limited, probably infectious-allergic skin disease predominately affecting small children.	2.0817655767396754
We describe five such cases.	2.483454404393534
The typical unilaterally located or at least unilaterally dominant exanthem usually starts in the axillary region and is characterized by red, partly confluent papules and fine scales.	1.9611385411616136
Two of the children presented with atypical manifestations of ULE.	2.3306405866318687
Due to its asymptomatic course, therapy is not necessary in the majority of cases.	2.744140836017658
Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is now an accepted alternative to conventional adrenalectomy.	2.2932020969377325
As in open surgery, several different endoscopic approaches to the adrenal glands have been described.	2.224209584925045
In principle, one must distinguish between the laparoscopic and the retroperitoneoscopic access.	2.0704628935289078
All adrenal tumors - pheochromocytomas included - except adrenal carcinomas can be removed endoscopically.	1.935314597291064
However, the use of these techniques is limited in patients with particularly large tumors.	3.2052972125100605
The results reported to date are convincing.	2.4776600936932383
Only limited data are available as yet to compare conventional and endoscopic adrenalectomy.	2.282460704596703
Because adrenal diseases requiring surgery are rare, endoscopic adrenalectomy is an operation that, for the present, will be limited to centers with a particular interest in laparoscopic and endocrine surgery.	2.226340144747444
Economic evaluations have become more and more important in the somatotherapeutic field.	2.441066814251699
This survey's objective was to examine if the current economic evaluation techniques can be applied to psychotherapy.	2.3849545077809564
8 data banks, 17 key words from the psychotherapeutic field and 14 economic key words were used, the identified original studies were classified in accordance with Drummond, the methodical quality of each study was assessed at a score between 0 and 10 points.	1.8799490178278548
21 studies were found: 16 cost- benefit analyses, 4 cost-effectiveness analyses and one cost-utility analysis.	2.0795214748480753
The quality of the representation of the clinical results (mean value 8.6) was better than that of the economic results (mean value 6.1).	2.233933706500628
Furthermore the evaluation type of cost-utility analysis, which is the only one that takes quality of life aspects into consideration and therewith seems to be the most appropriate approach regarding the psychotherapeutic field, has been greatly ignored.	2.3870589799014543
As a net effect of ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) cardioprotection due to vasodilative (reduction of blood pressure, afterload reduction), antiproliferative (reduced cell growth, reduction of "vascular" andor "ventricular remodeling", reduced formation of extracellular matrix), as well as antiadrenergic actions and due to the stimulating effect on natriuresis, reduction of blood pressure, preload reduction can be expected.	2.0251668469333644
These aims of therapy have mostly been confirmed for the action of ACE-inhibitors by experimental and clinical studies but except for the treatment of arterial hypertension and few preliminary reports concerning the treatment of cardiac dysfunction, no comparable data are available for AT1-receptor antagonists.	2.391365713794772
To date, an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic action could only be demonstrated for ACE-inhibitors.	2.234632514780532
Despite the similar spectrum of action there exist important differences between ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists that might underline the need of an individual use of these drugs: the dual action of ACE-inhibitors on the RAS and the kinin system bears many benefits but has been also shown to be accompanied by side-effects, mainly chronic dry cough, in a relatively high percentage of patients thus leading to discontinuation of therapy in 8-14%.	2.0192719517031956
This respective side-effect can be prevented by the use of AT1-receptor antagonists.	2.7135298642527883
It has been discussed whether the incomplete action of ACE-inhibitors on AT1-receptor-mediated effects is at least in part responsible for the efficacy of this drug which is relatively high (75-80%) as compared to other substances.	2.3526480440609316
Due to their direct action, AT1-receptor-blockers might also be of high effectiveness for the treatment of severe heart failure.	2.2929873570945216
A combination of the ACE-inhibitor-mediated activation of the kinin-system with the more specific blockade of AT1-receptors by AT1-receptor antagonists might be of benefit and is currently under investigation.	2.0117969674268887
Finally, it has been discussed that the incresed AT II concentration in case of AT1-receptor-blockade activates AT2-receptor-mediated mechanisms thus leading to an additive vasoprotective effect.	2.1939771990988737
An isomorphic response is defined as a nonspecific skin stimulus eliciting a disease-specific skin reaction.	2.1425313935639156
We report on the development of the Koebner phenomenon in a 32 year old patient with psoriasis after skin testing with UVB at a dose above 0,055 J/cm2.	2.214167597317326
In addition we describe a 28 years old patient who developed new psoriatic plaques in the areas affected by the virus after a varicella infection.	2.200390997654973
The presence of nicotine in sweat obtained from smokers and one non-smoker exposed to tobacco smoke after 4 h to 8 days of nicotine-free time was investigated.	1.7696386679353142
Following stimulation of the eccrine glands, sweat samples were taken every hour for 6 h.The total nicotine concentrations, i.e.	2.0396577541438807
the sum of nicotine and its metabolites, were determined by radioimmunoassay.	2.268655865464506
Up to now there is no specific treatment targeting the ultimate cause of interstitial cystitis (IC), since its pathogenesis and etiology are still unknown.	2.0097108127554932
Most studies focussing on oral medication have not been randomized, double-blinded or placebo-controlled.	2.3396041777467422
Consequently there is as yet no standard oral therapy available for the treatment of IC.	2.550780119010174
Differential radiomodification induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is proving to be a feasible modality for optimizing tumor radiotherapy.	2.3305350606577298
Our earlier work on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells has shown that pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives increases the uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG.	1.9937374104454064
Moreover, the alteration induced in bioenergetic profile was more drastic and less reversible.	1.9293438296750622
The promising combination of hematoporphyrin derivatives and 2-DG has been further evaluated in the Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice for determining the effects on radiotherapeutic response.	2.0434823686855337
Tumor bioenergetics was assessed by 31P MR spectroscopy.	2.509068853017659
The uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG was observed to be increased following pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives.	2.1983650683516642
Upon hematoporphyrin derivatives + 2-DG treatment followed by irridiation, the intracellular pH reduced and a remarkable increase in glycerophosphorylcholine and inorganic phosphate levels was observed.	1.8662661047522062
The present study demonstrates the potential of hematoporphyrin derivative pretreatment in increasing the bioavailability of 2-DG in a mice Ehrlich ascites tumor model.	2.0091635943692583
The finding may have interesting clinical implications in the form of increased manifestation of the radiation-induced damage in the case of use of these drugs as a potential adjuvant in radiotherapy of tumors.	2.38855937929696
The novel Lenz (1835) by the German author, social revolutionist and physician Georg Büchner (1813-1837) can be regarded as a prominent document in the history of medicine.	1.962409192200114
On the one hand, Büchner's description of a schizophrenic disorder meets recent criteria; on the other, he hints at the physician's modern general attitude toward the patient.	2.057625204133898
The latter is derived from his philosophy of art and political motives.	1.9819329485830217
The hypothesis is discussed that a dysfunction of the descending antinociceptive system may underly the pain of fibromyalgia.	2.156696695488643
Data from animal experimentation show that an interruption of the system by spinal cord cooling leads to (1) increase in ongoing activity,  (2) lowering in stimulation threshold, and (3) increase in response magnitude in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons.	2.145898835785668
The influence of the descending system was stronger on the responses to input from deep nociceptors than to input from cutaneous nociceptors.	1.9859536494493613
If similar changes occur also in patients, an impairment of the tonicly active descending system should be followed by (1) spontaneous pain (ongoing activity), (2) tenderness (lowering in mechanical threshold), and (3) hyperalgesia (increased responses to noxious stimuli).	2.2566370407909258
These changes should affect mainly deep pain, because the antinociceptive system influences predominantly input from deep nociceptors.	2.0182363684004208
Animal experiments with microbiologic examinations and studies in cell cultures have shown that ionomer cement is a biocompatible and biostable bone replacement material in the head and neck region.	1.9678754615788097
Clinical and functional results of its use in the human middle ear have proven to be satisfactory during a maximal period of 2.5 years observation.	2.2220614775358576
The present trial was continued in order to determine the long-term behavior of ionomer cement (Ionos partial and total ossicles) after reconstruction of the ossicular chain.	2.5217840632335364
The ossicular chain was reconstructed in 343 cases and included various losses of one or more of the ossicles (i.e., incus, incus and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure, and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure).	1.8438916172278508
Follow-up extended over a maximum period of 5.5 years.	2.08778358426096
Patients were examined under a surgical microscope and a pure-tone audiogram was performed at regular intervals.	2.0512947204410885
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not presently performed in Germany.	2.2395834087885986
According to PGD's opponents there, existing laws for the protection of embryos forbid this type of diagnostics.	2.0073070061159535
Proponents feel that these laws do not stand in the way of PGD, depending on legal viewpoint.	2.118745822626664
This controversy has hindered PGD's application in Germany.	2.2341606294426732
The nature of this longstanding, emotional discussion is not easy to describe to scientists abroad.	2.0249846345854645
This retrospective study investigated the stability of the small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration used in the treatment of 42 mostly unstable distal radius fractures (types A-3.2, C-1.2 and C-2.1 according to the AO classification).	2.1730983161758166
No bone grafting was performed.	2.6418438276167304
All cases were documented with antero-posterior and lateral X-rays preoperatively, 0, 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively and after consolidation.	2.2395946741040693
Early functional aftertreatment was started one week after surgery.	2.2620714460595472
Thirty-six fractures showed a dorsal comminution, combined with osteopenia in 18 cases.	2.1917428338785796
The mean preoperative radial angle of 17 ° was normalized to 25 ° postoperatively.	1.998226596348585
The mean preoperative volar angle of minus 30 ° was reduced to 12 ° postoperatively.	2.0734728660947592
None of these mean angles changed until consolidation.	2.158333285615908
The external fixator was removed on average after 7 weeks (range 6-10 weeks) depending on the radiological fracture healing.	2.240041361491919
The small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration proved to be stable enough for early functional aftertreatment of the wrist.	2.060400952335006
Its stability is related to a proper operative technique and correct indication (unstable Colles type with one or two distal fragments).	2.0745014542506612
Bone grafting is unnecessary if the external fixator is left in situ until bony consolidation.	2.0892415418884234
Purpose: To develop and implement a method to obtain digital subtraction (DS) spiral computed tomography angiograms (SCTA) in order to avoid superimposition of bony structures and vascular calcifications on SCTA maximum intensity projections (MIPs) and shaded surface display (SSD).	1.744527216990681
The concept of small-volume resuscitation, the rapid infusion of a small volume (4 ml/kg BW) of hyperosmolar 7.2-7.5% saline solution for the initial therapy of severe hypovolemia and shock was advocated more than a decade ago.	1.9750939083279033
Numerous publications have established that hyperosmolar saline solution can restore arterial blood pressure, cardiac index and oxygen delivery as well as organ perfusion to pre-shock values.	2.2831057732273368
Most prehospital studies failed to yield conclusive results with respect to a reduction in overall mortality.	2.5404098442271694
A meta-analysis of preclinical studies from North and South America, however, has indicated an increase in survival rate by 5.1% following small-volume resuscitation when compared to standard of care.	2.271249904609359
Moreover, small-volume resuscitation appears to be of specific impact in patients suffering from head injuries with increased ICP and in severest trauma requiring immediate surgical intervention.	2.2350553901136827
The utility of electron beam computed tomography (EBT) to estimate cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated.	2.195199607951544
Eleven patients with suspected acute cerebral ischemia were investigated.	2.4296901972037195
The EBT was performed with an acquisition time of 50 ms per slice at eight parallel levels.	2.09828762563371
To compare signal/noise and contrast/ noise ratios the data from the EBT investigation were compared to a similar examination on a spiral CT.	2.161533690861748
The signal/noise ratio with EBT was about 30%, the contrast/noise ratio 25% of that with spiral CT.	2.0773599523589574
The absolute values of CBV were 4.9 +/- 1.2 ml/100 g (EBT); CBF was 50.5 +/- 7.0 ml/100 g/min in normal contralateral brain tissue.	1.9341982678030325
In four patients with proven infarcts on follow-up, the ischemic areas had a CBV ranging from 1.7 to 3.8 ml/100 g, while CBF ranged from 9.4 to 24.5 ml/100 g/min.	1.9469538227874434
Using a bolus injection of contrast material, calculation of absolute CBV and CBF is feasible using EBT.	2.004513829972241
Advantages of EBT are the absolute measurements possible and it's multislice capability.	2.056256652200037
Disadvantages, however, are caused by the high image noise, limiting the demarcation of ischemic tissue.	2.6217650610067196
The report, in two parts, sums up the findings of a survey covering 52 cities in Central Europe.	2.1402698466745047
Most administrations have imposed a ban on feeding street pigeons, but this has been more or less unsuccessful.	2.0621617789045668
Information campaigns were used on a large scale, along with more controversial methods such as catching the birds or shooting them down, providing pigeon houses, administering hormone preparations, chemosterilization, and exclusion from buildings.	1.7047036050143856
Few attempts were made to reduce the number of breeding places.	2.744680292069001
Population reduction by poisons or natural enemies seems to be negligible.	2.4369539546573367
We report a rare case of an accident during which a pedestrian was hit by a car and was thrown through the windscreen into the front seat.	1.932872106323524
Apart from the high speed (100 km/h or more) the traumatic amputation of both lower legs and the resulting reduced angular momentum mainly contributed to the final position of the pedestrian in the vehicle.	1.9952152560716683
In addition, the low height of the person standing in front of the vehicle is deemed to have been a supporting factor for the course of the accident.	2.2133203952885205
A 41-year-old woman with severe juvenile diabetes mellitus suffered from profund hypothermia after loss of thermoregulation in diabetic ketoacidosis.	1.9725951167490579
She was found unconscious, without measurable blood pressure; the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed bradycardia of 30/min and the rectal temperature was 23.7  °C.	1.8956846570171664
The patient received mechanical ventilation, fluid therapy, warmed gastric lavage, and, unfortunately, inotropic medication.	2.009514342944395
She was transferred to a department of cardiac surgery in order to continue the therapy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	2.3828392724592415
On arrival, the patient had a rectal temperature of 27.3  °C, the ECG showed an absolute arrhythmia with a frequency of 70/min, and the blood pressure was 63/43 mm Hg.	2.4928174908389806
We decided to use a rapidly available but not highly invasive venovenous hemofiltration technique for slowly rewarming the patient.	1.9356214612690974
Vascular access was achieved by percutaneous femoral vein cannulation with a Shaldon catheter.	2.1912562833362843
The hemofiltration system (Gambro AK-10, Gambro AB, Sweden) was instituted with a blood flow rate of 200 ml/min.	2.0073679482240614
The hemofiltration monitor controls the pumps for filtering and substituting fluid volumes and allows the infusion solutions to be heated up to 40  °C.	1.7864235368918728
Sinus rhythm resumed without antiarrhythmic medications at a temperature of 29.5  °C, and within 8 h the patient was rewarmed to 35.5  °C.	2.0484091981534296
After treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia, she was discharged from the intensive care unit to complete treatment with no evidence of any permanent organ damage.	2.281637336379762
We conclude that hemofiltration may be the method of choice for rewarming deeply hypothermic patients when their circulation is preserved.	2.1440174331626536
Under these circumstances, it is preferable to external rewarming techniques, as it avoids the disadvantages of temperature afterdrop and rewarming shock.	2.299033952556296
Rewarming rates of 1.5  °C/h seem to be adequate.	2.465965747726016
Hemofiltration systems are more widespread, less invasive, and easier to handle compared to CPB techniques, which should be preferred in situations of prolonged unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation with cardiac arrest and deep core temperatures.	1.9997706113323626
We report an unusual injury of the face caused by the spoke of an automatic telescoping umbrella that come loose when the umbrella was opened.	2.12837884872999
Due to the shot-like force of the spoke, the left nostril, septum and right wall of the nasal cavity were pierced.	2.0033618982069084
The part with the joint penetrated into the maxillary antrum.	2.214862368184924
In order to remove the spoke, wire scissors had to be used to cuff off the spoke's joint inside the surgically opened maxillary sinus.	2.1803426185814523
Seven patients with pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma were treated with inhalation therapy with 36 million IU interleukin-2 for six months.	2.3378995423726754
Inhalation therapy was combined with four bolus infusions of DTIC at a dose of 850 mg/m2 once every four weeks.	2.1417711425091284
Therapy was well tolerated with low toxicity.	2.6398667800482905
Six of the patients developed cough; one patient was slightly feverish.	2.8548504637649663
We conclude that inhalation therapy of lung metastases is a promising addition to the therapeutic arsenal against malignant melanoma.	2.2378655904605163
Twelve patients with extensive lichen planus, resistant to different regimes of prior external and internal therapy, were treated with PUVA-bath photochemotherapy (psoralen bath followed by UVA irradiation) using bath water containing 0,5 mg/L of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP).	1.907577171152374
In 11 of the 12 patients, the skin lesions showed a significant improvement or even complete remission within six weeks of treatment.	2.3943538069058783
In one patient, only limited clinical improvement could be achieved.	2.4341916293054218
A mean of 19,1 (SD +/- 3,6) PUVA-bath treatments were carried out.	2.3561891452657133
The mean cumulative UVA-dose given until clearance of the lichen planus was 16,7 (SD +/- 4,8) J/cm2.	2.127500967204694
No side effects were seen except an increased phototoxic reaction in two patients manifested as slight erythema.	2.172726999615609
The results of this trial show, that PUVA-bath photochemotherapy with 8-MOP is an effective therapeutic alternative to all other known therapies in the treatment of extensive, exanthematic and also hypertrophic-hyperkeratotic lichen planus.	2.0520276866069094
In comparison to oral PUVA therapy and PUVA-bath therapy using 4,5',8-trimethoxypsoralen, balneophotochemotherapy with 8-MOP shows an excellent efficiency-side effect correlation.	1.8296936694611554
The clearance of the refractive skin lesions by balneophotochemotherapy with 8-MOP demonstrates the superiority of this therapy over all other common therapeutic modalities used for lichen planus.	1.880093536328198
Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) may occur in up to 70% of septic patients and multiple organ failure patients.	2.3756551990195156
Typical clinical signs of CIP are the difficulty to wean the patient from artificial respiration, a symmetrical flaccid quadriparesis/-plegia that is more pronounced in the distal parts of the limbs, reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes, and muscular atrophy.	1.9618528110716134
This article describes and discusses the clinical and electrophysiological features and clinical outcomes, physiopathological concepts, therapeutic implications, and the complex differential diagnosis of CIP from a neurological point of view, focusing on disorders of the nervous system and myopathic abnormalities.	2.2538314987713703
The data available in the literature were reviewed and compared to our own findings in order to deduce a clinical definition of CIP.	2.662911137831978
It is a particular aim of this work to emphasize the crucial importance of electrophysiological investigation and monitoring in the classification of the nature and extent of neuromuscular disturbances in critically ill patients.	2.2529187221030846
Myths about development during midlife are examined in the light of recent research studies.	2.2641091945586003
These studies show clearly, that midlife is a developmental phase of its own, the course of which can only slightly be predicted by previous development.	2.1595804923562554
The assumption of a depressive crisis automatically occuring must be rejected as well as "positive myths" denying the evolving limitations in certain areas of life.	2.0784159986200286
Developmental tasks and developmental possibilities are described as well as the clinical concept of a phase-specific "return of the repressed".	2.465640454770784
Possibilities of councelling and psychotherapy with couples during midlife are outlined.	2.055027703071443
The general aspects for the analysis of malalignment of the low tibial region in the three-dimensional space are discussed.	2.334323859788344
Recommendations for clinical and radiological diagnostics prior to low tibial osteotomies are given.	2.3210196937624037
Closing wedge, opening wedge, dome-shaped, distraction, rotational and step-shaped osteotomies as well as combined procedures are described.	2.1597345546617817
The possibilities of these techniques are pointed out for malalignment after lower leg, pilon and ankle fractures, as well as after trauma of the distal epiphysis of the tibia.	2.4259320782798364
Arthroscopy of the ankle is an additional tool for detailed planning of the adequate surgical procedure.	2.37666698579479
The importance of determining an early correction cannot be underestimated.	2.087609049642199
Medical faculties must discuss how this development can be curtailed.	2.1965206505259376
In order to check the current situation, the Habilitation degree systems of 36 medical faculties of German universities were compared with the aid of a scoring system.	2.084998505573912
Conformity existed only in the demand for a doctoral dissertation, scientific publications and a lecture on approval.	2.0373616409084367
Concerning other criteria for qualification there was decreasing consensus in the following order: Habilitation thesis, commitment to teaching, further professional education, participation in congresses, inaugural lecture, qualification to teach, scientific activity, broad background in the discipline, and introduction to the faculty.	1.6670436289758253
Application of the scoring system with a maximum of 33 score points resulted in a mean value of 15.2 points and a range from 6 to 29 points.	2.2272976454250557
A significant decrease in the score values occurred with increasing age of the Habilitation degree (P = 0.002).	2.2490202251830778
Even if scoring systems are ambiguous and unfair, our analysis revealed serious differences in the quality of the Habilitation degree.	2.2315953447280816
Presuming that the German Habilitation degree should be maintained as a high-level qualification, we developed proposals that might be used to standardize this academic examination.	2.1991164898433686
Chronic reduction in uteroplacental blood flow causes intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).	2.0678538266429953
In an animal model fetal umbilical perfusion in experimentally induced IUGR was examined.	2.017478598984612
Pregnant sheep were instrumented with externally adjustable occluders on the common internal iliac artery to regulate uterine blood flow in the last third of gestation.	2.109948321750157
Flow probes on the uterine arteries and the common umbilical artery provided blood flow measurements.	2.099080797953208
When the experiment was terminated and morphometric data were obtained, uterine blood flow in controls was significantly higher than in restricted animals.	2.1120456634025273
Umbilical blood flow in IUGR animals was lower than in controls.	2.542479882687312
The relation between uterine and umbilical blood flow became closer with advancing gestational age.	1.911995441234073
Chronic reduction of uterine blood flow in late pregnant sheep causes IUGR accompanied by changes in umbilical blood flow which may be due to fetal adaptation.	2.1359053448210483
Four hundred and eighty-eight radical retropubic prostatectomies (RRP) were performed on clinically localized prostate cancer at one institution within 5 years (1992-1996).	1.8896234784454018
Within the observation period, the annual rate of RRP increased by 81 % from 69 to 125 cases.	2.012812166821116
The authors noted a decline in the occurrence of advanced tumor stages (65.0 % to 39.2 %) and small cancers ( < 0.5 cc: 7.2 % to 1.6 %) and an increase in pathological T2 tumors (30.4 % to 55.2 %).	1.9273945609694447
The rate of positive surgical margins declined from 34.7 % to 12.8 % (for all pathological stages).	1.8542772209928449
These data confirm trends which were observed in the USA with increasing detection and treatment of localized prostate cancer.	2.5547366208823825
Prognostic assessment of acute global cerebral anoxia following cardiorespiratory arrest requiresa high level of clinical and technical diagnostic skills.	2.109650871406094
Statements regarding prognosis of this form of coma can be made only with reference toa large number of clinical, neurophysiological, biochemical, and cerebral imaging data.	2.181708884380036
Previous research in this field has usually been restricted to only one or a few parameters such as clinical data, EEG findings, evoked potentials or biochemical markers.	1.9923490289678898
The present compilation of the various aspects regarding diagnosis and prognosis is intended to define the present state of the art in diagnosis and prognosis of anoxic coma, and also serve as a basis for a multicenter prospective study including all of the relevant data to improve diagnosis and arrive at guidelines for effective prognostication of anoxic coma.	2.142915403770156
In 96 patients (ductal pancreatic carcinoma, n = 34; periampullary carcinoma, n = 43; chronic pancreatitis, n = 19) the role of CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of lesions of the head of the pancreas were evaluated.	2.5340952755009067
The sensitivity for ductal pancreatic carcinoma was 73.3 %, for periampullary carcinoma 48.8 %, and specificity was 63.2 %.	1.9823746141525087
Carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated only in every fifth patient.	2.34796520004567
Even when combining the two tumor markers no increase in sensitivity could be observed.	2.0198757247170978
The low specificity of 63 %, which decreased to 33 % in the case of obstructive jaundice, does not allow adequate preoperative differentiation between cancer patients and those with chronic pancreatitis.	2.2402120755543518
In cases of postoperatively elevated CA 19-9 level the prognosis is worse than in patients with normal tumor markers.	2.370565830236335
The management of neuromuscular foot deformities in children and adolescents must be individualized because of differences in etiology and pathomechanics.	2.065503754698145
If conservative treatment fails or reaches a plateau early soft tissue procedures are recommended.	2.0893782224495374
Treatment should focus not only at correction of the deformity but also at reestablishment of muscular balance.	2.085302935377529
Early postoperative mobilisation is usually possible provided adequate orthotic control is maintained.	2.0702068873814787
Regular clinical follow-ups help to minimize postoperative problems.	2.4656166178572723
The general aim should be an optimization of functions and only rarely to achieve a normal foot.	2.30467491540317
The basic principles of management can be described as correction of deformity, stabilization of unstable joints and balance of muscle power.	2.1560106485057187
This minimally invasive arthroscopic technique was applied in patients suffering from degenerative lumbar stenosis between L3 and S1.	2.1270894686764454
The first part of the study dealt with lumbar hernias.	2.898162141540595
Of a total of 222 patients, 175 (78.82%) showed radicular canal invasion ranging between 50 and 90%.	2.1493367959396354
The disc level was L4-L5 in 59%, L5-S1 in 39%, and L3-L4 in 4%.	1.819556956886462
Most of these hernias were lateral extrusions.	2.192956731722002
However, the study also included protrusions and foraminal hernias, since they were large and technically difficult to operate on.	1.96400175027276
In terms of distribution,  25 patients (14.28%) had protrusions and 120 (68.57%) extrusions, and in 30 patients (17.14%) hernias had migrated.	2.026804930626509
Surgery was carried out by the biportal posterior approach through the flaval ligament.	2.397222302978659
An irrigation pump was used and the structures were under permanent accurate arthroscopic visualization.	2.0266617219189578
Good results were obtained in 96%, fair in 3%, and poor in 1%.	2.339019800054149
The second part of the study dealt with lateral stenosis.	2.7238689065252584
Drawing from the experience gained by experiments performed in 1993 on five cadavers and by translaminar epidural endoscopy since 1986, this surgical technique was designed to provide decompression by resection of the ventral zone of the articular facet and, in some cases, foramenostomy.	2.062148407855776
Of the 19 patients treated, nine presented with pathology in one segment, nine in two segments, and one in three segments.	2.0413407183024224
All had lumbar and sciatic complaints, intermittent neurological claudication and predominantly lateral sensory motor deficit.	1.8758785553596435
The general results were good in 84% and fair in 16%.	2.152739571827432
The effects of "Care-insurance" on the situation of those in need of home care, is the object of first implementation-studies of SGB XI.	2.0739117709946484
They largely agree on the high level of satisfaction found among those who draw the benefits of the insurance scheme, particularly among those who claim a cash premium; further they largely agree on the low level of influence of the "Care-insurance" on changes in the form of nursing.	1.9612103271376953
An account of the results of the milieu-oriented "Freiburger Pflegestudie", which investigates the effects of "Care-insurance" differentiated according to the various types of care-situations, forms the centre of the article.	2.460277127617984
A possible intraoperative complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is opening of the gallbladder with subsequent loss of gallstones.	2.2400146532059737
We report on a 61-year-old woman who was hospitalised with an obscure subhepatic tumor.	1.9563709135033616
Intraoperatively an abscess was found that had been caused by lost gallstones following after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 3 years previously.	2.218864616468904
There is a low incidence of late abscesses caused by loss of gallstones, but because of the long latency and unspecific symptoms there may be problems in diagnosis.	2.2422338102690236
Taking into consideration possible complications caused by intraoperative loss of gallstones, all concrements should be retrieved, even though there is no indication for changing to an open procedure.	2.0426891517545616
Since squamous cell carinoma of the penis is rare, prospective trials do not exist.	2.1218237911996614
Therefore, new treatment strategies have to be developed.	2.7007447242460714
Based on our experience with the treatment of 22 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma, we describe our therapeutic approaches.	2.8842768759688906
Ten patients with superficial disease (T1-2N0M0) were treated with partial penectomy.	2.3583925355121202
The 3-year survival rate amounted to 90 %.	2.6239520787902664
In patients with extensive disease (T3-4 or N1-3) a partial or total penectomy was performed.	2.015590482992618
After initial antibiotic therapy for 4 weeks, patients underwent inguinal lymph-node dissection and if the nodes were positive, additional pelvic lymph-node dissection.	2.3093209892707787
In patients with ulcerous inguinal lymph-node metastases surgical resection was performed, covering the wound with a musculocutaneous flap (tensor fascia lata flap n = 2; rectus abdominis flap n = 1).	1.9434673958775024
The 3-year survival rate of patients with T1-2N1 tumours (n = 4) was 67 % and with T3-4N1-3 (n = 8) 25 %.	2.295615905977271
Patients with distant metastases received inductive systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin, methotrexate and bleomycin.	2.049034968730767
Objective responses occurred in 22 % (1 CR, 1 PR) of 9 patients.	2.089824670664454
These results suggest that immediate radical surgery with lymph-node dissection is the best treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.	2.545467328289071
Biomechanical investigations in eight specimen elbow joints to test articulated external fixation showed correct extension-flexion joint position between 0 and 120 °.	1.8665828950308951
The central axis through the radial and ulnar condyles varies less than 3 ° in total.	2.054245309751932
X-ray kinematography showed correct articulation in all cases without subluxation.	2.6035225436326708
In six patients with persistent subluxation and complex fracture of the proximal ulna external fixation with an additional articulation was placed.	2.4382575072211723
All patients began with physiotherapy on the 3rd day after operation, the range of joint motion was 0-30-95 ° in all cases, after 6 weeks 0-30-110 °.	2.1744829156355014
Additional articulated external fixation at the elbow joint can be an alternative treatment to long-term transfixation of the elbow in cases of complex injury.	2.793700762768146
How important and predicative are clinical parameters and locoregional failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinomas for the probability of the occurrence of distant metastases?	2.2635065922887936
From 1 August 1990 to 1 October 1998, 139 patients with carcinomas of the oropharynx were treated in a prospective study by radical radiotherapy and evaluated in regard to the clinical parameters reflex-otalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T-category, presence of involved lymph nodes, and smoking and drinking habits.	2.0892437558106614
Twenty-nine patients received a concomitant chemotherapy.	2.5861260029915547
Twenty-five out of 139 patients had a planned neck dissection after completion of radiotherapy.	2.2275407983669857
Ten patients received a salvage operation.	2.707381849372447
The median follow-up time was 24 months (range, 4 to 74).	2.6101237238448185
Two- and 5-year overall survival rates according to Kaplan Meier were 56.1 and 49.6%.	2.1799930784754222
The tumors were controlled in 77/139 patients (55%).	2.139304933583283
The therapy failed in 62/139 patients (45%).	2.1237619104474534
Both groups, 62 patients with locoregional therapy failure and 77 patients with locoregionally controlled tumors, were comparable in regard to performance status (Karnofsky index), age, gender, TNM-categories, histological differentiation, drinking habits, pretherapeutic diagnostics, total dose (Gy), and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.	2.0112075943574834
Locoregional tumor control was significantly determined by the parameters reflex-otalgia (p < 0.0078), predominant growth pattern (p < 0.012), T-category (p < 0.03), and smoking (p < 0.0285).	2.048663702532103
The median survival time of patients with locoregional failure is 17 months.	2.766144589626562
At this moment 81% of locoregionally controlled patients are still alive.	2.275092280176113
In 14/62 patients (23%) with locoregional failure, distant metastases were detectable against 4/77 (5%) of locally controlled patients, p < 0.0026.	2.021470046196777
Probability of local control and distant metastases, predominantly pulmonary, reached a plateau after 24 months.	2.105374345674687
Locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is an important parameter for the probability of the development of distant metastases.	2.9405782855895906
Failure of local therapy is caused by the biologic aggressiveness of the tumor.	2.713435881074595
Telemedicine includes all medical activities in diagnosis, therapeutics, or social medicine undertaken by means of an electronic transfer medium, enabling the transmission of visual and acoustic information over long distances to doctors not personally present at the place of the requested consultation.	1.8584406530701685
The aim of this study was to evaluate the retropatellar pressure, force, and contact area in cases of knee arthroplasty compared to knees without arthroplasty.	1.978062539064376
We examined six leg specimens before and after knee arthroplasty.	2.4541480940135694
The modified Thiel fixation was used, and arthroplasty was the Genesis I without patellar implant (Fa.	1.944498825481365
Smith & Nephew, Schenefeld).	2.5491539193162387
Contact measurements were performed with pressure-sensitive film (Fuji Prescale type "super low") in 45 °, 60 °, 90 °, and 120 ° knee flexion.	1.8863339944242863
The results were evaluated with special software, "Pressure Imaging and Analyzing System FPD-901 Series".	1.9134759401880208
The leg was exarticulated in the hip joint and the knee joint was opened from a suprapatellar approach.	2.3402200138700175
The film was placed at a defined area between the facies patellaris of the femur and facies articularis of the patella.	2.164558067377068
Instantaneous pressure was measured during a time of 5-s pressure increase and a further 5 s. A force of 280 N was applied to the quadriceps muscle.	2.1670006439895406
Before knee arthroplasty, the contact area measured 154.3 mm2, the average pressure was 1.14 MPa, the force 182.13 N. After knee arthroplasty, the contact area was 119.94 mm2, the average pressure 1.522 MPa, the force 180.98 N. Following knee arthroplasty the contact area decreased significantly (P=0.015), and the average (P=0.0001) and maximum pressure (P=0.0003) increased significantly.	1.8713567010735295
The force did not change significantly (P=0.7642).	2.299334752429604
The increased contact area could also prevent increasing retropatellar pressures after knee arthroplasty and further complications.	1.9491229053753862
Maculopathy occurring in young patients is a challenge in differenzial diagnosis.	2.470241787117569
Besides hereditary macular dystrophies and acquired macular degenerations, rare systemic disorders should be considered.	1.9847106495148177
Histological examination of 1660 biopsies (2 - 5 mm) of the synovial membrane of 317 patients were obtained by arthroscopic dissection; in 70% of all cases non-specific changes were revealed and in 30% specific changes.	2.290938425149182
The findings included different stages of proliferation of the superficial layer, uncharacteristic inflammatory reactions of the stratum synoviale and fibrosis of the stroma, vascular proliferation and pseudopolypoid thickening of the synovial membrane.	2.023013299399247
The aim of this study was to determine the impact of prolonged single lung ventilation and intrathoracic insufflation of CO2 during computer-enhanced totally endoscopic bypass grafting on biventricular myocardial function.	1.8698661876659055
Methods: Transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively in 20 patients undergoing the above mentioned operation.	2.357462230234328
At distinct time points during the intervention, a cine-loop of both ventricles was registered employing a mid short axis view.	1.867786611977811
Simultaneously, oxygenation parameters as well as electrocardiographic data and intrathoracic CO2 pressure were taken.	2.559616175577034
Wall motion analysis was done postoperatively.	2.6219104745354374
Results: With increasing duration of single lung ventilation, significant regional and global biventricular hypokinesia was detected.	2.0117911928569177
This was accompanied by a decrease in PaO2 and a marked increase in intrathoracic CO2 pressure.	2.380546543812331
These alterations disappeared after weaning from extracorporeal circulation and reconstitution of double lung ventilation.	2.049867427173418
Conclusion: These results show that computer-enhanced coronary artery bypass grafting leads to significant alterations in intraoperative biventricular myocardial function.	2.185183358857738
This can be due to either an impact on oxygenation during single lung ventilation or due to intrathoracic CO2 insufflation.	2.0714187378302924
However, in our group, these alteration showed only small clinical relevance.	2.1454446800522575
During the last few years the fast development of different laser and laser-like systems for photoepilation and their one-sided representation in media has led to confusion among pysicians and patients.	1.8447563400160525
The object of this review is to give a structured report of different pulsed laser and laser-like systems (Epilight, Photoderm, long-pulsed ruby-, alexandrite- and diodelaser) that are available in Germany, including their side effects and complications.The current status of scientific investigation in this field is discussed.	2.0446275740915576
The purpose of the present study was to increase the free range of motion in conventional trust-plate prosthesis design and to optimize the trust-plate contact as well as the osteointegration area below the trust-plate.	2.24959078694009
A few studies have reported familial aggregation and association with HLA.	2.189465208483377
We have studied genetic linkage of FMS with HLA in multicase families, and found a rather weak linkage of FMS with HLA (P<0.029).	1.7468304926458402
Malformations of the urinary tract are one of the most common types of anomalies in the neonatal period.	2.473935792901224
Approximately 15-20% of all prenatally detected malformations  require acute postnatal imaging.	2.244559358289693
Sonography is the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of nephro-urologic problems in infancy.	2.334430653826941
Hydronephrosis represents the most common pathology, followed by multicystic-dysplastic kidney.	2.737299411825071
Discussion: The result of the sonographic examination directs further imaging.	2.4831683355333856
An adequate diagnostic algorithm is decisive  for accurate diagnosis, for the appropriate therapeutic regimen and for the prognosis  of the patients.	2.488647017597316
Previous studies have shown that calcification is decreased in porcine heart valves that have undergone treatment for lipid extraction.	2.0652472457374342
The relation between lipid distribution and calcification of seven new commercially available porcine bioprosthetic heart valves (St. Jude Medical, Bioimplant) is assessed by Sudan red III staining to show preexisting lipids.	1.6489718585475623
All porcine bioprosthetic valves contained lipids to different degrees.	2.2322579655708847
Five valves were subjected to the pulsatile accelerated calcification process for 4 weeks.	2.112486628990441
Distribution and level of calcification were evaluated by radiography and compared to the Sudan red-stained fatty areas.	2.360994129989705
Comparison of the calcifications detected by radiography and the macroscopically detected lipids showed a coincidence of 57-66%.	1.951534220590753
Two porcine bioprosthetic valves were histologically prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and von Kossa's stain, respectively.	1.8382162863050244
By light microscopy, the von Kossa staining revealed microcalcifications and polarizing microscopic investigation showed birefractive substances in areas with lipid deposits.	1.8106369723490097
These preexisting substances in porcine valve tissue may play a determinative role in the calcification of the tissue.	2.3040266787197266
Substantial studies are necessary to further determine the role of preexisting lipids in calcification.	2.550325487689726
Therapy for hip dysplasia and DDH by means of sonography.	2.7162737454478867
Numerous methods are available for treating "congenital" dysplasia of the hip (CDH).	2.5187865170845405
The important point seems to be the differentiation between dysplastic hip joints with and without displaced femoral heads.	2.528282338021911
A historical review of the diagnosis of so-called "congenital dysplasia" and dislocation of the hip and different indications for therapeutic maneuvers is given.	2.760807273114828
Generally, a three-step plan of treatment is recommended: dislocated heads must be reduced, after which retention is needed until the hip joint is stable.	2.1550104018111553
This is followed by maturation period, until the nonossified hyalin cartilagineous performed acetabular roof is ossified.	1.884862614869696
All hip joints, regardless of age, can be assigned to one of these phases.	2.5562079706218723
To prevent the residual dysplasia of the acetabulum roof and femoral head necrosis, the reduction-retention position should be more than 90  ° flexion in the hip joint, but not more than 45-50  ° abduction.	2.257627759772106
In each therapeutic phase there is a different biomechanical situation in the hip joint.	2.471239911251457
The appropriate orthosis for treatment is chosen according to the particular biomechanical situation.	2.473305230208413
Each sonographic type can be set up according to the our classification in the three-phase treatment system.	2.4802742057487754
In this way the adequate orthosis for treatment in each treatment-phase can be chosen.	2.1316022977699842
A case of a patient with malignant acanthosis nigricans in association with carcinoma of the lung is reported, documenting successful palliative treatment of the warty papillomatous thickening of the lips with electrocautery.	2.438716305660456
Molecular atmospheric oxygen contains two unpaired electrons in the unreactive triplet state and thus has to be activated in order to react with other biological molecules in the singlet ground state.	2.047765093766263
These processes of activation include very reactive intermediates.	2.219711118016297
Therefore, aerobic cells must cope with - and to some extent also adapt to - oxidative stress provoked for example by infection or intoxication, where reactive intermediates of oxygen activation accumulate.	1.7947772384682645
Depending on the strength of these impacts, several symptoms indicate the deviation from normal, steady-state metabolism.	1.8794669606582366
Most of these visible or measurable symptoms are connected with oxygen activation where principally a transition from heterolytic reactions (two-electron transitions) to increased homolytic reactions (one-electron transitions) is observed.	1.6975442148907562
Homolytic reactions produce free radicals, which are generally counteracted by a parallel increase of intrinsic radical scavenging processes or by compounds administered with food, thus warranting metabolic control within certain limits.	1.8567524665064699
At advanced states of stress, control may be gradually lost and chaotic radical processes dominate.	1.9154310328277244
Every episode during this cascade is characterizable by the balance between pro- and antioxidative capacities.	1.970221973406283
Antioxidants, which in many cases are free radical scavengers or quenchers of activated states, comprise a wealth of classes of organic molecules including phenolics, probably as the most prominent ones.	1.9576911269200898
In this article, mechanisms of oxygen activation and protection from oxidative damage are discussed.	2.0075384801052496
Furthermore, examples of antioxidative functions of a few important natural products are reported.	2.0806757792239283
In a monocenter prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial the efficacy of homeopathic treatment was investigated on children with adenoid vegetations justifying an operation.	2.0584771686141097
Patients were treated with either homeopathic remedies such as Nux vomica D200, Okoubaka D3, Tuberculinum D200, Barium jodatum D4 and Barium jodatum D6 or with placebo.	1.7275784951061384
The duration of the study for each patient was 3 months.	3.0845951194864534
Examination of the ears using a microscope, rhinoscopy, stomatoscopy and pharyngoscopy, as well as tympanometry and audiometry were performed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.	2.130510873346926
Out of a total of 97 children studied between the ages of 4 to 10 years 82 could be analyzed.	2.2225986764846883
At the end of the study no operation was required in 70.7% of the placebo-treated children and in 78.1% of the children treated with homeopathic preparations.	2.1722163771522554
These results show no statistical significance.	2.5103297797271806
A treatment technique favorable for linacs with asymmetric jaws, which combined cranio-caudal matching fields with fields enclosing the whole target volume, is investigated with respect to field matching and sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	1.7752524716635356
For a pelvic target volume rapidly varying in cranio-caudal direction a 5-field technique was planned with individually weighted and blocked fields.	1.8846199164685484
Three fields adjoining in cranio-caudal direction were completed by 2 fields enclosing the whole target volume.	1.8799152663342196
The matching line was measured and calculated with Helax TMS©.	2.2671927554349804
Furthermore a 4-field box and opposing fields were planned.	2.1913759929046495
The dose-volume histograms for target, bladder, intestine and soft tissue were exported.	2.055272658091988
Normal tissue complication probability and tumor control probability, respectively, were calculated for all techniques.	2.2307761283850853
For fields enclosing the whole target volume the dose maxima in the region of the matching line decreased to 2.0% (caudal) and 1.8% (cranial), respectively.	1.8372529573830247
For the dose profiles calculated with Helax TMS© no overdose was found.	2.0061105443268237
The 5-field technique with adjoining fields results in a better sparing of the organs at risk compared to the other techniques, whereas the tumor control remains the same.	2.3091027311317665
In specific cases a technique with cranio-caudal adjoining fields can be recommended with respect to sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	2.107154685443625
Disseminated Langerhans-cell-histiocytosis (LCH) is most frequent in children at the age of 1-3 years, seldomly seen in adults and extremely rare in the elderly.	2.376842988401907
The clinical course may be acute, subacute or chronic, progressive or stationary.	2.118170345918218
Spontaneous remissions are possible, but rare.	2.5369034694229344
In elderly patients often the disease is at first limited to the skin before it becomes systemic.	2.348323445425071
Because of its central location, the elbow joint is considered the most important joint within the upper extremity from the viewpoint of function.	2.356428420708084
Trauma to osseous and ligamentous structures of the proximal forearm confronts trauma surgeons and orthopedic specialists with numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.	2.2392604894578483
Conditions following elbow trauma are often accompanied by chronic pain and diminished range of motion, leading to functional deficits of the entire arm.	2.3867749781368546
There is now practically no doubt that primary osteosynthesis, anatomical joint reconstruction and early onset of functional treatment are essential for a good final outcome.	2.059506748464342
With our expanding knowledge of the anatomical and biomechanical condtions in the proximal lower arm in the last few decades the basic principles of therapy have also changed, and current standards of treatment for proximal forearm trauma are presented in this paper with reference to the relevant literature.	2.2722297286163333
The series of five patients with symptomatic isolated right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and no structural heart disease which were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the ectopic focus are reported in order to discuss radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment in patients with right ventricular outflow tract ectopy without ventricular tachycardia.	2.3353578895478275
Basic principles for treating patients with chronic pain are presented.	2.570705841476439
They are the result of a longterm collaboration of collegues from different medical specialties in the pain outpatient unit of the University of Ulm.	2.1462510715957053
In contrast to a variety of literature on chronic pain patients, these principles focus on the contribution of the therapists to the development of problems in treatment.	2.4711457732252557
Eight principles, considered especially important for the treatment of chronic pain patients are presented and discussed.	2.9524629202650434
We discuss this entity with the aid of a case report and the existing literature.	2.4421848276146005
The therapy of these tumors includes resection and possible adjuvant radiotherapy.	2.235077105595405
Rhabdomyosarcomas are an exception, because they also show a good response to chemotherapy.	2.416621221040833
14 human femurs were scanned by CAT and 3D reconstructed.	2.125254709534668
In every specimen digital documentation of CCD and antetorsion (AT) angle was performed.	1.9465453675466011
With a special software package (Orthodoc) virtual preoperative planning for implantation of a cementless total hip alloplasty was undertaken.	1.9962604023374826
The specimens were randomised into two groups, one of which had manual and the other one robot implantation of the femoral component.	2.4028665257200585
After implantation all specimens were evaluated again by CAT and CCT and AT angle were documented again.	1.9161111058335019
The preoperative CCD angle was 126.7  ° (SD = 4.0) in the manual group and 127.8  ° (SD = 4.3) in the robodoc group.	2.089079569399321
Postoperatively the angle averaged 131.9  ° (SD = 0.8) in the manual group and 133.2  ° (SD = 1.9) in the robodoc group.	2.147353027459345
Significant differences were found for the AT angle in both groups.	2.4215634985836254
The preoperative AT angle in the manual group was 31.3  ° (SD = 8.8), decreasing to 20.5  ° (SD = 9.5) after implantation.	1.882943222830352
In the robodoc group this angle was 30.9  ° (SD = 8.0) before and 31.3  ° (SD = 8.7) after implantation.	1.9280244877852126
The difference between pre- and postoperative AT angle averaged 10.8  ° (SD = 6.4) in the manual group and only 0.4  ° (SD = 0.9) in the robodoc-group.	2.170155172324642
Conclusion: With the technique used, preoperative planning in hip alloarthroplasty is much more accurate than with the conventional technique with plain X-ray.	2.133585155173491
The virtual preoperative planning can be transferred to the intraoperative setting with high precision.	2.277530209416381
These factors may lead to an increase in outcome quality.	3.0200033009044063
1000 drug-related fatalities that were examined in Hamburg from 1990-1996 by the Institute of Legal Medicine were analysed with respect to consumption of substitute drugs such as methadone.	2.155599086859116
The incidence of methadone-related fatalities has increased in the last two years.	2.658216104891689
The highest incidence was found in 1995 when methadone was detected in the blood of about 20% of all drug-related fatalities.	2.5162842789544997
Lethal monointoxications or combined intoxications with a dominant role of methadone were experienced rarely (about 1% of all drug-related fatalities).	1.9935712786402477
Of the persons who were enroled since 1990 in a methadone maintenance programme 2% have been registered as drug- related fatalities.	1.9258856242130655
The mortality of street addicts without comparable medical help was about 10% in the same period.	2.062878800088136
There is further need for improved methods of registration, documentation and forensic/sociological analysis of all drug-related fatalities for reliable conclusions concerning mortality rates of drug users who are enroled in methadone maintenance programmes.	1.8108503844123083
Pulmonary infections and tumors are a major cause of death in patients with AIDS.	2.919689447714375
The combination of clinical, radiological, laboratory, and pathohistological data helps to narrow the spectrum of differential diagnoses or even allows a specific diagnosis in many patients.	2.0897142282344388
Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis should be obtained as soon as possible during the clinical course of the illness to initiate treatment in time.	2.3292965208992973
Computed tomography (CT) has proven to provide promising results in the diagnosis of AIDS-related thoracic diseases.	2.6115099147937766
The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the diagnostic capacities of CT in the context of particular AIDS-related thoracic pathologies.	2.3026608714437318
Additional information on the spectrum of pathological agents and on differential diagnostic signs is summarized.	2.351293098169028
This study was designed to provide information to which extend home-based nursing care services for the elderly take part in the care for older people with mental disorders.	2.1286156376581022
Also of interest was the involvement of clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system in the health care for the clients.	2.1918805969903135
A one day data collection in 29 nursing care services in two North Rhine-Westphalian regions could raise informations about 1,246 clients aged 60 years and over 1, 522 persons (41.8%) had a mental disorder, diagnosed by a nursing and/or medical professional.	1.8638013568220104
68% of the mental disordered clients had dementia or a demential disorder, 6% a functional psychoses, and 31% a neurotic, psychogenic disorder or substance abuse (small number of clients with two and more diagnoses).	1.8618287614585853
82% of clients with mental disorders had one or more additional somatic disease(s).	2.2247024334842505
These diseases were mostly the cause for the involvement of home-based nursing care service.	2.3182242571919174
Barely 8% of clients with mental disorders were placed from clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system into the nursing care services.	1.882563477318685
Beside the home-based care, only 12% of mental disordered received clients outpatient psychiatric treatment.	2.0682873631914216
Systematic cooperation between the nursing care services and the system of (gero-) psychiatric treatemnt was a rare exception.	2.1787942985502626
Acute cerebral nerve paresis can be caused in many different ways.	2.3490728776439482
One of the more rare causes of paresis of one or more neural pathways is dissection of the internal carotid artery.	2.1280928632997798
Early diagnosis is important, even with atypical symptoms, since prompt anticoagulative therapy can hinder stroke from embolism due to the dissection.	2.2462803683190478
We report on two patients with Raeder's syndrome and Collet-Sicard syndrome resulting from dissection of the internal carotid artery.	1.8793441331563208
Besides the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our study, loss of function has also been reported with the sixth to eighth cranial nerves, so that any painful, sudden cranial nerve deficiency can indicate possible carotid dissection.	2.044218924640673
In hematopoiesis, regulation and differentiation present a very complex functional network in which multiple factors of the microenvironment are involved.	1.9695141646388787
In addition to direct cell-to-cell contacts and the modifying influences of the intercellular matrix, soluble mediators play an important role in intercellular communication.	2.053316414928234
Cytokines exert their effects by binding with specific receptors that transfer their signals to individual cells.	1.9623456023084858
A common structure shared by subunits of these receptors leads to competitive inhibition in binding the cytokines with different affinity.	1.8546893290364672
By this mechanism specificity is reduced, on the one hand; however, on the other the complexity of interactions in the bone marrow is enhanced.	2.5191925646184403
A flood of in vitro and in vivo studies have established the impact of various cytokines on single hematopoietic cell lineages and their application for clinical use.	2.0415515705829037
However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the cellular origin of the cytokines.	2.47753763415345
Wound healing represents a dynamic process of increasing scientific interest, especially with the detection of the different growth factors.	2.601215143448636
Economic aspects are also of importance in the investigation of substances used for wound healing.	2.4254031330818866
In Germany 25% of all patients (ca.	2.6995256175639306
1 million) with severe chronic venous insufficiency have crural ulcers.	2.3056993243410076
There is no doubt that the quantity of bacteria is of importance.	2.125099399090453
Local antibiotic treatment is difficult, as most of the substances used are known to inhibit wound healing.	2.6903468340454095
In vivo and in vitro investigations showed, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic has a bacteriostatic function.	2.0639209460528853
Additionally it was shown, using cultures of fibroblasts, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic does not inhibit the growth of fibroblasts, whereas PVP-iodine solution, a widely used antiseptic, clearly reduces the growth of fibroblasts.	1.9128637884048734
The good clinical results in the treatment of acute and chronic radiation damage indicate that chiniofon-containing antiseptic may have antiflammatory activity.	2.323183330587404
This article presents the heuristics concerning description of individual generative behavior.	2.000641670983219
The aim is to describe the development of the desire for children, the generative action and the dealing with generative decisions for intended and unintended childless women and men as well as parents.	2.2713602646589957
The main emphasis of the existing heuristics is placed on psychological questions.	2.1152226886404066
These heuristics explain patterns and influencing factors of generative action as well as positive and negative influencing factors of the coping process.	2.4275640091896347
It may be helpful to use heuristics which describe development of and coping with generative action as background information to ensure comprehensive consultation and therapy planning.	1.9194661526586978
Morbus Parkinson is a progressive degenerative disease of the human central, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems.	2.2842187080984466
In the course of the disease, not only the substantia nigra, but also extranigral components of the motor system, as well as numerous limbic system and autonomic centers undergo serious damage.	2.3949866205464327
Accordingly, Parkinson's disease is a multisystem disorder.	2.3331570016409393
Only specific types of projection neurons fall victim to it.	2.115434636200272
The first manifestation of the pathological process which causes the disease are abnormalities of the neuronal cytoskeleton.	2.298396131971153
Intracytoplasmic inclusions evolving in the form of Lewy bodies in perikarya and Lewy neurites in the neuronal processes result in premature cell death of the affected neurons.	1.958930681850484
On the basis of this selective neuronal vulnerability, a categorization emerges of the pathological changes within the nervous system and corresponding functional impairments.	1.9251988269471711
Introduction: Children with "nursing bottle syndrome" and long standing teeth destructions and no treatment so far were examined for accompanying pathological changes in the bacterial flora of the mouth and alterations due to chronic inflammation of the oral mucosa and the alveolar jawbone.	2.0055284994894054
Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone marrow caused by both non-specific and specific agents.	2.7058223332022884
Typically, the non-specific form occurs in children and young adults, and the sites most frequently affected are the distal and the proximal ends of the tibia and femur.	2.7436987174606817
In tuberculosis, osteomyelitis is predominantly located in the vertebral bodies.	2.4371296748395768
In rare cases osteomyelitis can be caused by viruses, fungi or echinococcus.	2.1951187954509415
It may also occur as so-called acute endogenic osteomyelitis, such as plasmocellular osteomyelitis and Brodie's abscess.	2.437520986055286
Histologically, dense infiltration of leucocytes, granulation tissue and bone sequesters can be seen.	2.1497974392280357
In tuberculosis granulomas with central necrosis, epithelioid cells and giant cells of Langhans type are characteristically found.	1.857418077941034
Most forms of acute osteomyelitis can be successfully treated with antibiotics, leading to complete healing without complications.	2.5063720854497946
Only a few reported cases develop into a secondary, chronic form.	2.100033118953988
Precision of osteodensitometric measurements using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) depends on various known factors, such as positioning, aortic calcification or vertebral fractures.	2.0521163312372788
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of various diseases or bone density on the reproducibility of measurements in the lumbar spine and the proximal femur.	2.321640758944897
Measurements in the LWS p.a., LWS lat.	2.1339790019634686
and at Ward's triangle were made in a total of 100 patients.	2.6138080768019805
The subjects were repositioned between measurements.	2.3765113221812753
In order to be able to determine the influence of various diseases, four groups of 25 patients each were formed: three with the diagnosis osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and one control group.	2.251337102269673
The mean percentual difference and coefficient of variation were calculated as the measure for reproducibility.	2.056339176693899
Mean percentual differences of 0.18 to 2.6% were found in the four groups at the three measurements sites.	2.332400400032073
and between 4.1 and 9.9% at Ward's triangle.	2.2933303878660403
It was also conspicuous that the difference in coefficient of variation in osteoporosis patients was nearly double that in the control group in all measured areas.	2.143728383668616
Conclusion: Lateral lumbar spinal measurements using DEXA cannot presently be recommended.	2.037238419573219
Background: We compared the endothelial protective function of two hyaluronic acid viscoelastics (Healon GV, Provisc) of different molecular weight and viscosity during phakoemulsification in high-risk eyes.	1.8809636416564748
Diseases of the peripheral nervous system occur in up to 50% of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).	2.165213652271994
In early stages of the infection, Guillain-Barré syndrome or a spontaneously remitting mononeuropathy can occur.	2.0107615275818405
The most frequent occurrence is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy associated with HIV, which can only be treated symptomatically.	2.2274882555535247
The most important differential diagnosis is a drug-induced polyneuropathy under antiretroviral therapy with the nucleoside analogues DDI, DDC, or D4T.	1.947773044588732
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is less common and can be treated with immunoglobulins or corticosteroids.	2.442280889590705
Very rare are steroid-responsive neuropathies with necrotizing vasculitis or in diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS).	1.8227418179685573
In the AIDS stage, polyradiculitis can occur due to opportunistic infections - most often with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or M. tuberculosis - or polyradiculopathies due to lymphomatous meningiosis.	1.7664336970805772
Mononeuritis multiplex is rarely seen in disseminated CMV infection.	2.3586370813186583
Myopathies can occur in all stages of HIV infection; their frequency is about 1%.	2.4060010342718745
Primary polymyositis associated with HIV, which can be treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulin, must be distinguished from myopathy induced by azidothymidine.	2.265304411571449
Other forms of myopathy are very rare.	2.5734580155289564
54 patients, who had been explored at the end of their treatment including a psychosomatic approach in a medical department of a general hospital, were interviewed again in their homes three months later.	2.3844211600861662
Contentment with treatment was high in the inpatient and outpatient setting, the ill felt only moderately stressed by their illnesses, showed an adaptive constellation of coping styles and were surprisingly well adapted.	1.772377167228981
The comparison between the two measures showed a less favourable view of the patients three months after discharge from hospital at a quarter of the tested parameters, the variability was high in the scales, that were used.	2.3624363343740984
Explanations for these results are discussed.	2.9346694489154053
At a long term perspective coping with illness may be improved especially by interventions of the family doctors.	2.168544625145901
Health care costs have risen considerably since 1970 in all industrialized countries.	2.0105306881837364
Advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for spiralling costs in health care.	2.382119712655853
Careful analyses reveal, however, that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high-technology (CT, MR) imaging.	2.3773458550382847
The legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained.	2.0528669098315007
Relevant suggestions, such as generally accepted examination strategies, should be realized with the help of the scientific societies.	2.4691597379363044
Background: Main features of the Coffin-Siris syndrome are mental retardation and absent or hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers and toes.	1.900269544195079
Further symptoms are wide mouth with prominent lips, sparse scalp hair, and hypertrichosis.	1.936890896981831
We report on two premature infants who had completed 25 and 29 weeks of gestation and who developed unilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema.	1.914508591398046
In both cases massive mediastinal displacement developed with compression and total atelectasis of the contralateral lung.	1.9967981207653946
By selective intubation of the respective main bronchus, complete ventilation of the collapsed lungs and sufficient gas exchange was achieved.	2.0439635483709315
After 3 days (case 1) and after 6 days) case 2), the unilateral emphysema receded and, subsequently, bilateral respiration was possible without relapse.	2.286634166745602
6 and respectively 11 days after selective intubation, extubation was performed.	2.1787219796728947
The two children were discharged at the age of 41/2 and 21/2 months showing complete respiratory compensation and equal ventilation on both sides.	2.044785207248481
Patient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris maculosa seu papulosa (Davies-Colley) presented with multiple cutaneous horns.	1.9056215737759874
The clinical picture, the histology, the electro microscopic examination, the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses.	1.9881009495372268
The patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures.	2.1963812606217306
Epidemiologic studies have shown that trace concentrations of inhalation anaesthetics polluting the air of operating theatres could have deleterious effects on the personnel's health.	1.9879249044381748
Nitrous oxide (N2O) oxidises vitamin B12 and thus decreases DNA production by inactivation of methionine synthase.	1.8478477026827271
Therefore, the United States and most European health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks.	1.8670782456961428
These values range from 25 to 100 ppm, expressed as time-weighted averages (TWA).	1.9526692853203655
There is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions.	2.0746543661036396
The aim of this study was to quantify levels of N2O in a recovery room (RR) with an air conditioning system.	1.9279839566678258
The blood loss during the acute period after complex pelvic trauma is finally responsible for the high mortality associated with this specific type of injury.	2.33762614358889
Several protocols have been published for optimized management, but up to now comparable data are not available as no exact definitions exist judging the severty of trauma and blood loss.	2.1559884410684345
As part of a prospective study 19 patients after unstable pelvic injuries with unstable circulation underwent emergency stabilization by the pelvic C-clamp.	2.2533908794745603
Beside standard clinical parameter the initial hemoglobin value was converted into a "bloodvolume equivalent".	2.0554164496796026
18 of the 19 patients had an injury severety according to group III and IV of the Hannover Polytrauma Score (PTS).	2.2154791011093886
Concommitant abdominal injuries were seen in 12 cases (23 injuries), concommitant urological injuries in 12 cases (14 injuries).	2.2173253126687507
In 13 cases the pelvis was the major source of bleeding in 9 cases an additional intraabdominal hemorrhage was observed.	2.110398040774925
11 patients died due to sequelae of their injury, 8 patients survived.	2.296588205016325
Although the initial blood loss was comparable both in the group of the deceased patients and the survivors, a 44% higher subsequent blood substitution (= 10 089 ml) was observed in the nonsurvivor group.	2.3085187381426326
In conclusion the data proofed that early control of hemorrhage is fundamental for the prognoses after complex pelvic trauma.	1.8886962598076005
The estimation of the blood loss may help in indicating agressive emergency procedures like emergency stabilisation, pelvic clamps, surgical exploration and tamponade.	2.10442517262508
This calculation may be a basis for a more detailed analyses of this devastating injury and judging the benefit of different management protocols.	2.2910520266630856
In contrast to childhood intussusception, the clinical signs of intussusception in adults are nonspecific.	2.3730237390916495
Generally organic alterations of the small bowel cause intussusception in adults.	2.4925995672017316
In this case report on a retrograde jejunojejunal intussusception in a 61-year-old male, following removal of an intraoperatively placed intestinal tube for ileus therapy, the clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods and therapy for intussusception are described.	2.202422739320133
Sonography is not only the diagnostic tool of choice in childs, but also led to the correct diagnosis in this case.	2.983483869174031
In contrast to childhood intussusception, operative treatment is preferred in adults.	2.0589145894444405
The term "frontal lobe syndrome" comprises a variety of different clinical syndromes produced by focal lesions involving the prefrontal cortex.	2.0282696868523375
However, similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks.	2.0733930763970823
With respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions, prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a disorganized type, caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections, a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex, and an apathetic type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the cingulum and the supplementary motor area.	1.9617294810110373
As intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described, in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed.	2.4454155618792357
The case reports of four patients illustrating the three major prefrontal syndroms following severe head injury (n=2) or cerebrovascular disease (n=2) are presented and diagnostic implications as well as possible treatment strategies are discussed.	2.412190114783873
The measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients, their family, and personnel.	2.371555829614173
A lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine, which in turn makes an impression on public opinion, and disturbs the reputation of the co-workers in intensive care medicine.	2.1257172508343163
To form an objective view, we carried out a survey of 40 co-workers (11 physicians, 23 from the nursing staff, and 6 ancillary personnel) regarding the medical technology, the environment in the unit, general medical questions, and the extent of intensive care therapy.	2.118666255216614
The length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1-240 months (median 18 months), the ages ranged from 21 to 53 years (median 30 years).	2.217066955573392
Of those questioned 73%  found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful: 100% of the physicians and only 57% of the nursing staff were of this opinion.	2.097901192544801
Only 9% of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear-inducing for the patients; in contrast, 61% of the nursing staff believed this to be true.	2.2276312588043554
The noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65% of the nursing staff and 45% of the physicians.	2.2599872321807353
Only 22% of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit; 48% felt that they were unhappy or even miserable.	2.078023044835489
Of the physicians 46% believed that the patients were comfortable.	2.5492817561230345
Of the nursing staff 100% were of the opinion that for the deceased patients, organ substitution therapy had continued too long.	2.0886831633488456
On the other hand, only 45% of the residents shared this opinion.	1.9759246806800057
The medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful, less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff.	2.3377356749169595
In many cases, the nursing staff as a group exhibited a contrary and negative opinion.	2.2626312575385272
This could possibly be caused by insecurity, lack of information and lack of successful experiences.	2.34779885067625
Next to patient outcome, the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team, with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine.	2.25966617186114
In this pilot study 12 patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were treated with 2 million IU interferon alpha 2a (Roferon A) three times weekly for 8 weeks and followed up for a further 10 weeks: 2 patients showed clear and 9 a slight to moderate reduction of their skin lesions; 1 patient got worse.	1.9613126906994045
Pruritus did not decrease and even increased in a few patients, and IgE levels showed no change during and after treatment.	2.4522497565614256
The efficacy of interferon alpha in the present therapeutic design for the treatment of atopic eczema must thus be classified as only moderate.	2.3087892501448906
Shock secondary to sepsis is a serious common disease with a substantial mortality.	2.307629549064214
Coagulation abnormalities, ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, are well recognized in patients with bacterial septicemia.	2.06540029197766
Therefore, the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps.	2.6623023004268083
We investigated 30 intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of abnomalities in coagulation at the beginning.	2.1375143828896896
Fifteen patients were treated with 1.5-5 E/kg body weight (Low dose group), the others received 8-15 E/kg (high dose group).	2.4516928837275622
Our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters - such as d-dimer, TAT and PTF 1 + 2 - in the High dose group without any bleeding disorder.	1.819091298227774
Thus, we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with LMWH as shown above.	2.100879509269939
Background: Laparoscopic techniques are currently used for curative resection of colorectal cancer although long-term results from controlled clinical trials are not available yet that prove laparoscopic procedures are adequate.	2.3079302975609277
Methods: All patients who underwent a curative resection of a colorectal tumor from 1995 to 1997 were included in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the short- and long-term results.	2.513057173127737
Results: Laparoscopic colorectal resections were accomplished in 68 patients.	2.2565849094943378
In only 3 patients was an adenoma (stage 0) found, and 10 patients had multiple liver metastases at the time of palliative resection.	2.1861925734743313
An oncological resection was performed in 55 patients.	2.9095966852821524
The average age was 62.8  +/-  14.6 years (29 female and 26 male patients).	1.9857605992412384
Eleven right colectomies, 1 left colectomy, 21 sigmoid resections, 16 proctosigmoidectomies and 6 abdominoperineal resections were carried out.	1.869691276485714
Two patients (3.6 %) were lost during follow-up.	2.2914358619596413
The median follow-up was 27.1 months (range 9.1-45.1 months).	2.3620656542919547
No port-site metastases were found.	2.377699761345328
Two patients who are still alive after sigmoid resection suffered from a recurrence.	2.473648159023261
The first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma.	2.0271066475368436
Only one patient died during the follow-up period because of myocardial infarction.	2.746743241852167
Conclusion: Although the follow-up is short, it seems that the recurrence rate is low.	2.6896009677143597
Controlled multicenter clinical trials are currently performed to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is really adequate to treat colorectal cancer.	2.235763232896726
The authors report a tracheal rupture in a 34-year-old patient who was primarily intubated following generalised seizures and loss of consciousness (Rüsch endotracheal tube).	1.989366366633508
Some hours later, she developed high ventilatory airway pressures and subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were noted.	1.9545988260251006
Reintubation with a high-volume, low-pressure endotracheal tube was planned when it was noted that the ballon of the Rüsch tube was grossly overinflated.	2.1664407649104263
Endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured and found to be greater than 120 cm H2O (the maximum measurement possible with the manometer).	2.1728279159003985
The diagnosis of tracheal rupture was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.	2.3590920420478976
The patient immediately underwent a throacotomy and a 3-cm tear of the pars membranacea of the trachea was sutured with a dural patch.	2.0763600113918588
To maintain low airway pressures post-operatively, she remained sedated for 2 days and received a muscle relaxant to permit pressure-controlled ventilation.	2.0099563156998523
In this case, it can be concluded that excessive inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff resulted in the tracheal rupture.	2.312920506267061
Other possible causes and results of tracheal rupture are discussed.	2.432289681425092
Urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40% of all nosocomial infections.	2.6398609338195604
In most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters.	2.284755090864914
The guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, as the most important evidence-based guideline worldwide, was published in 1981 and has not been updated so far.	2.1284408166844364
Evidence-based national guidelines are not available in Germany.	2.505452036799683
We have, therefore, performed a literature search for randomized, controlled studies on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (Medline, Cochrane Library, reference text books) published since 1981.	1.9214652507666292
Fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified.	2.2809190304710665
Substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials.	2.2820580777082164
Based upon the CDC guideline, whose principles are still valid, updated guidelines for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been developed by the National Reference Center for Hospital Hygiene.	1.9992284794617368
Chronic hypoperfusion of the hypogastric arteries due to aortoiliac surgery leads to a complex of symptoms well known as Lerich's syndome.	2.075528045408202
In contrast, acute ischemia of the pelvic arterial tree leads to lethal complications [2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13].	2.3146336717475697
Acute interruption of the hypogastric perfusion mainly occurs after aortoiliac surgery or after selective transcatheter embolisation of the internal iliac artery for control of pelvic bleeding [1, 8].	2.082273275906716
Several complications may occur after total occlusion: urinary bladder necrosis [6], left colon ischemia, spinal cord ischemia [10], nerve palsy, necrosis of the rectum and gluteal musculature [2, 11-13].	1.959480894097881
Despite adequate therapy, mortality is over 70% [2].	2.3336365503605787
We report the case of a 66-year-old patient who survived after acute occlusion of the iliac arteries with gluteal necrosis following replacement of the infrarenal aorta with an aortobiiliacal graft.	2.101856114940787
As demonstrated in 44 allogeneic sibling (34 HLA identical, 10 HLA mismatched at 1-3 loci) and 6 unrelated (1 HLA-identical, 5 mismatched at 1-3 loci) cord blood (CB) transplantations CB has been shown to be a rich source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.	1.7968571019569057
Therefore, a scientific pilot project in order to evaluate HLA class I and II typed cord blood samples for unrelated transplantation was initiated.	2.1909401837580353
Hitherto 372 CB samples: mean volume 79 +/-  5x108, were collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after vaginal full term delivery (n=302) or ceasarean section (n=70) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen.	1.69316918672489
Methods for HLA-typing by serology for HLA-class I and II from minimal cell amounts were adjusted that only 1.5 ml of the whole CB was needed for both the HLA-class I and II typing by serology (1 ml) and DNA-typing for HLA-class II (0.5 ml).	1.9071626874242538
Only 3.5 additional ml of the CB were required for the AB0 typing, control of sterility, determination of progenitor cells by colony forming assays and CD34 and the analysis of contaminating maternal cells by simultaneous immunophenotypic and genotypic analysis of interphase cells and the PCR using sequence-specific priming (PCR-SSP) for the non-inherited maternal allel.	1.795144866533101
Mother'sera have been tested for HBsAg, anti-HCV, -HAV, -HIV-1-2, -EBV, -VCA, -HTLVI-II, -CMV, Toxoplasmosis and Syphilis.	2.0964429863107927
Nonepithelial malignant tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms with a frequency of ~0,6%.	2.507294536953037
They are always explored because of a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.	2.517385592198149
Amongst the more than 600 primary pancreatic neoplasms in our pancreatic tumor archive only 5 neoplasms were of nonepithelial origin (one was a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [MPNST], one a leiomyosarcoma, one a malignant mesothelioma, and two were peripheral neuroectodermal tumors [PNET].	1.7429676446021602
The differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum, undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and, especially in the case of PNET, malignant lymphoma.	2.4164256225749887
Preoperative chemotherapy and down-staging can improve the operability and  prognosis, especially in PNET.	2.40286175785272
In patients with renal or hepatic failure, the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways, leading to the necessity to correct the dose.	2.1508893479844233
The liver is the major site for biotransformation of most opioids.	2.22829404045392
The major metabolic pathway is oxidation.	2.334080607659569
Exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine, which undergo primarily glucuronidation, and remifentanil which is cleared by esther hydrolysis.	1.8630199880088296
The hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly excreted by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency.	2.453757124830693
Some metabolites such as morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) or normeperidine are active opioid agonists.	1.9074131612182128
With high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression.	2.1923161926594665
In addition, special risks are known for normepridine that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures.	2.398887365475336
Few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramdol have been reported.	2.2289250118828368
The elimination half-life of these drugs was prolonged.	2.588631176891401
Lastly, the disposition of methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure.	2.08493766480113
Methods: In 30 asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an ELISA test specific for Helicobacter pylori.	2.409504046932129
In 10 symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa.	2.1996934520958553
Cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal.	2.202417602610432
Results: With the serological or histological result as reference method, the cut-off value for children (delta value = 5 permil) has shown a sensitivity/specificity of 70 %/95 % or 100 %/100 % respectively.	1.8302155947210696
Cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly.	2.168956092264963
30 minutes after 13C-urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection.	2.092756091794664
Conclusion: Our modification of the 13C-urea breath test for children is suitable to prove an Helicobacter pylori infection.	1.9777580176039429
This review summarizes some aspects of German pediatrics as it developed after world war II.	2.019531684124778
Having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late forties and fifties and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly industialoized nation.	1.6953747819456177
As in other countries, the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social attidudes and expectations, and by economic restrictions.	2.0159709426338077
National specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and formalized preventive care program under a public health plan.	1.8939948520539451
The need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among subspecialties.	2.2017355253523876
Aim of this study was to isolate T lymphocytes from atheromatous plaques and to determine they respond to Chlamydia antigens.	2.0808208745658967
In recent years, mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease.	2.299208640257318
However, since October 1994 a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed.	2.668295537722932
At four hospitals in the Saarland, Germany, 45 cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period.	2.138898596124772
In addition to the case history and clinical findings, the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased IgM titer.	2.6726932576173543
None of the patients had been previously vaccinated.	2.9009318358478318
The main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination, one which has almost no side effects.	2.28762039773158
The goal of this study is to describe the disease, present our own results, and indicate the need for vaccination.	2.5578505434345593
In addition to providing information, a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination.	2.354869462035374
Although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years, the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination.	2.7462537347803306
Neurofibromas, café au lait macules and freckles in the axillary or inguinal regions are common manifestations of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (NF-1).	1.8540163696393102
Less known is the simultaneous appearance of dermal melanocytic naevi.	2.236489227571141
In addition, there were several large grey-blue macules histologically characterized by fusiform pigment-bearing cells in the dermis, which we diagnosed as persistent aberrant mongolian spots.	1.894191337582483
In the right zygomatic region she presented a grey-blue, hair-bearing macule, which we saw as a variant of Ota's naevus.	1.8737494985600793
A genetic background for this coincidence of a systemic with a local phakomatosis can be supposed, as both Schwann's cells and melanocytes are derived from the neural crest.	1.909344971606397
Such pathologic rearrangement in the embryogenesis of the cellular elements could be important for the pathogenesis of NF-1 and dermal melanocytic nevi.	2.3414015274405
Infectious agents may directly or indirectly (through the response of the host's immune system) modulate the growth of vascular cells.	2.056157830124142
Local and/or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of (re-)stenosis in the vascular tree.	2.4918373780716525
Further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for atherogenesis and restenosis.	2.363935870324664
Their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions.	2.3079240863573367
Besides other reasons, cost containments mandate the rational use of preoperative screening tests which should be adapted to the risk of the individual patient.	2.3614719531854482
Since the perioperative cardiac risk increases with age, elderly patients in particular require a thorough evaluation of their perioperative risk.	2.0412787294418897
Routine ECG, however, is not indicated in patients under 45 years of age who do not present with signs or history of preexisting cardiac diseases but should be performed on a routine basis in all patients over 45 years of age.	2.2733541011353124
The validity of an ergometer test as a preoperative indicator of myocardial ischemia is limited due to a high incidence of false negative results.	2.220751409313246
By preoperative routine chest radiography previously unknown findings are only detected in a small number of patients; thus, in patients of ASA-risk groups I-II younger than 74 years of age routine chest-x-ray cannot be justified.	2.305929376663805
In patients whose perioperative cardiac risk as assessed clinically and by ECG is ambiguous, dipyridamole-thallium-myocardial scintigraphy (DTMS) and dobutamine-stress-echocardiography may contribute valuable information regarding the prediction of perioperative adverse cardiac events.	1.756760517546185
In that respect, dobutamine-stress-echocardiography appears to be superior to DTMS.	2.2625770505590586
The laboratory tests required in patients of different ASA-risk groups and according to their age are presented in an overview.	2.272515645797233
Generalized muscle weakness in critically ill patients can result in prolonged periods of artificial ventilation and longer stays in the intensive care unit.	2.093700399221232
Both neuropathic (critical illness polyneuropathy) and myopathic (critical illness myopathy) abnormalities seem to play an important role for this prolonged weakness.	1.9723606200347077
This article reviews its complex differential diagnosis with special emphasis on the current understanding of the neuromuscular syndromes.	2.3109319558806614
An efficient diagnostic plan is necessary for the exclusion of other curable causes of prolonged muscle weakness even in the presence of polyneuromyopathic changes.	2.2901973135932288
Psychological support of the patient and prophylaxis of secondary complications of prolonged immobilization are crucial when specific therapy is not possible.	2.503195014461615
Modern ultrasonic diagnostic instruments with high resolution and color Doppler sonography allow the obstetrician to describe pathological findings very precisely and at an early stage of pregnancy.	1.939379978121768
The use of high-resolution ultrasound makes it possible to detect heart malformations already between the 8th and 10th week of gestation.	2.0842783829249463
This development has essentially changed the clinical requirements on fetal autopsy which in its traditional way no longer meets the increased demands.	1.8661300043439764
Unless the pathologists faces this challenge the importance of fetal autopsy will diminish.	2.3372165586010314
Modern image databases and communication techniques allow the pathologist to have direct access to text and images of pre-findings by other clinics.	1.8723427848189933
Great importance, however, must be attached to the interdisciplinary cooperation with obstetricians and geneticists.	2.4446496124902777
We report on routine fetal autopsy by using an interdisciplinary database an the Charité.	1.9589504372556485
Infrainguinal arterial reconstruction for intermittent claudication has been discouraged because of fear of bypass graft failure, significant perioperative complications, and limb loss.	1.95648169231321
This may be worse than the natural history of the disease.	2.3292705179125854
In our study, we retrospectively evaluated all infrainguinal bypass procedures performed in the past 10 years.	2.332154706201359
Radiosurgery represents a minimally invasive radiologic method for the treatment of intracranial tumours and arteriovenous malformations.	2.6611825632686728
In 1994 the radiosurgical device 'Leksell Gamma Knife' (LGK) was installed in a dedicated logistic environment for outpatient treatments.	1.7492963407830457
High quality requirements have to be met for radiosurgery.	2.680320171179543
The target point accuracy taking into account the whole system was shown to be reliably below 0.5 mm whereas the spatial therapeutic resolution was 0.035 cm3.	2.0262771648148887
Quality parameters of the dose plan were evaluated for the first 500 consecutive treatments.	2.5859908408796635
These values and examples of dose plans were used to emphasize the advantages of the treatment principle with multiple isocenters.	2.4187174274905288
An analysis of data in the literature revealed that there is no uniform standard of treatment available in radiosurgery.	2.8460018893563896
A highly significant correlation between a risk prediction model for the stereotactic linear accelerator on the one hand and a different model for the LGK on the other could be shown.	2.2591295210009488
This result could be helpful in order to proceed towards a more uniform treatment standard in radiosurgery and to improve overall treatment results.	2.2657771663539448
Even if Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever - bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations - he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections, to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of childbed fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures, especially the hand disinfection.	1.902035989092034
He has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or putride lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health-care personnel act as vehicles.	1.6946132586123543
As a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection, he noticed that generally only the weakend organism of the patient is involved as an infection target.	2.22360469584691
The impact of his doctrine not only made him "saviour of the mothers" but also justifies to regard him as "father of the obstetric infection prevention" if not even as the founder of the modern science-based hospital hygiene.	1.757878525456959
Our approach is to estimate the spatial position of the tibial and femoral components of the prostheses from their contours in the X-ray image.	2.594546632204863
When we know the exact shape of these two components, we can calculate the minimal spatial distance between them which approximates the remaining thickness of the inlay.	2.072582850595503
Most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with Borrelia Burgdorferi.	1.9608112253385463
Erythema migrans is a classical skin lesion of early borreliosis characterized by a centrifugally expanding erythema at the site of the prior tick bite.	2.0757092346410504
After hematological spreading of the vector multiple erythemata migrantia occur with a very low incidence in Europe as described in the case of a 2 1/2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine.	2.2093260642862984
One year follow-up revealed no further manifestations of borreliosis.	2.6902716145251437
This means an excellent prognosis for those children with borreliosis who are treated promptly.	2.2162721691428726
Background: We compared the standard suprathreshhold strategy to the so-called threshhold splitting strategy with 5 and 2 dB steps.	2.0627885051709773
Resection specimens of 14 patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three-step regression grading system: grade I, no or only slight tumor regression; grade II, incomplete tumor regression; grade III, complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue.	1.8749923781497886
In five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples, a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis, foam cell rim, vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen.	1.8698285561481325
This morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic, but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy.	2.138957333285574
The presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci, however, argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression, which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer.	2.2050714967594853
Background: The term "Castleman's diseas" (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) comprises a heterogeneous clinicopathologic entity among lymphoproliferative disorders.	1.7972901862307704
In accordance with the German law on care for helpless persons, an observer rating scale has been developed to allow a staging of need of care.	2.0661409697455726
Construction of the scale, item descriptions, definitions, algorithms for sum score and inter-rater reliability data are reported.	1.835240252338059
The scale can reliably measure the need of care, quality of care, and who is the care provider.	2.503433543806206
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) improves the success of trabeculectomy.	2.5921643140131225
Since in vitro studies showed a prolonged effect of 36 days of growth inhibition with a single dose of 5-FU, 5-FU is applied intraoperatively.	2.428649694399332
To evaluate the effect of intraoperatively applied 5-FU, we compared 13 (low-risk) patients with intraoperative application of 5-FU to a control group matched by age, diagnosis, sex and stage of glaucoma.	2.3867239162003226
Postoperatively on day 4 the IOP was significant lower (4.8 mmHg) in the 5-FU-group in comparison to the untreated group (P=0.005; power 0.80).	2.296000750813185
After 1 week the difference decreased to 2 mmHg and was not significant any more (P=0.16).	2.0709126246553526
After 1 week a lower mean intraocular pressure of 2 mmHg was found with a P-value of 0.16.	2.0105824252548006
5-FU side effects such as corneal complications and inflammatory reaction were not increased in the 5-FU group.	2.394997490500659
However, one case of persistent hypotony was seen in the 5-FU group.	2.7537704254821103
However, this effect may not be based on an antiproliferative effect alone, but might be of toxic origin.	2.47080028636674
A postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery.	2.4148315044302735
Clinical signs, laboratory findings, ultrasound and ERC lead to diagnosis.	2.192674409862137
We report on 40 cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube.	2.0239009136669015
In all patients the fistula healed within 7 days after placement of the tube.	2.2462861809745442
Two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess, and in 2 patients drainage of a bilioma was performed.	2.502968263252828
The nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract.	2.050259298361055
Description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes, which requires dialysis, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, who developed fulminant systemic calciphylaxis after successful renal transplantation.	2.0621219152105543
Characteristic of this syndrome, there occured soft tissue calcification, mediacalcinosis of the small and medium-sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis.	1.992862997054628
The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but challenging agents like corticosteroids or immunsuppressants, in a sensitized organism (at hypercalcemia or elevated parathormon) could lead to calcium deposits.	1.8785740614265254
Lungs, stomach, kidneys, cutis, heart and vascular system are most frequently involved.	2.1382928038533833
Treatment is primarily supportive; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis.	2.2476510299586057
Recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy.	2.8820422147068054
The cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented, and the importance of the association of latex and cross-reactivity with food items is stressed.	2.3091369698573216
The food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado; banana, avocado and buckwheat; and banana, avocado and tomato.	1.7669982299937628
The cross-reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before.	2.2263285716435037
The branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR syndrome) is characterized by auricular abnormalities, lateral cervical fistulas and preauricular tags.	1.9975930952546657
The hearing impairment may be a conductive, a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss.	2.1886687960845492
The renal disease is oligomeganephronia, a bilateral, congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of nephrons.	2.003195984106839
The BOR syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disease.	2.708680735329803
The available literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts.	1.8000785503746595
The CO2 laser myringotomy is a current low-pain procedure for middle-ear ventilation for secretory otitis media (SOM) that can be performed under topical anesthesia, even in children.	2.105742615783364
The duration of middle-ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created.	2.3467251456445513
Perforations with a diameter greater than 2 mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately 3 weeks, thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes.	2.1321990374532307
To date, the CO2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope.	2.0578353263603537
The CO2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system.	2.1987438741961416
The incorporation of a small inexpen-sive CO2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in SOM therapy.	1.9101162615742608
Abstract   Amifostine is an organic thiophsophate which protecvts normal cells from the effects of chemotherapy with reduced nadir and duration of cyclophosphmamid induced neutropenia, reduced cisplatin derived renal and neurological complications being described.	1.9101621833576468
However, no data are available for urological malignancies treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.	2.2002303352459736
Aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of pretreatment with amifostine in terms of prevention of renal, hematopoetic and neurologic toxicity.	2.3872215885062813
17 patients (mean age: 62.6 [45-74]) with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder received inductive or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy (1-6 cycles) with a cisplatin dose of 70 mg/m2.	2.2325074865877097
Amifostine (740-910 mg/m2) was administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy.	2.169174313333881
For all patients creatinine clearance, serum creatinine and electrolytes including magnesium, and blood cell count were determined prior to and after each cycle.	1.9656217444351491
A group of 12 patients (mean age: 61.9 [51-67]) did undergo MVEC chemotherapy (1-4 cycles) without receiving amifostine and served as control group.	2.10158710048115
Amifostine was well tolerated and only 1 patient suffered from gastrointestinal discomfort, blood pressure remained unchanged in all patients.	2.471614162875086
Amifostine prevented a significant reduction of creatinine clearance even in the 2 patients with known renal insufficiency: mean creatinine clearance was 125  +/-  20 ml/min prior to and 115  +/-  25 ml/min after chemotherapy.	2.2096451343109047
In the control group, however, creatinine clearance dropped from 121  +/-  30 ml/min to 85  +/-  20 ml/min after completion of MVEC chemotherapy.	2.3761940831755157
Serum creatinine levels did not increase significantly (1.1 mg/dl prior to and 1.2 mg/dl after chemotherapy), magnesium levels did not decrease significantly and normalized at the end of chemotherapy.	2.2110083095998037
Significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 29 % and 12 % of the patients in the amifostine group and in 67 % and 33 % of the patients in the control group.	2.7177562185013633
Amifostine was shown to have a protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in the elderly patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy.	2.3934778216887236
Based on our data amifostine should be applied in the supportive management to prevent chemotherapy induced complications.	2.1029425709405865
The diagnosis of leptomeningeal dissemination of chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) by conventional cytology is unreliable because cytomorphologic criteria of malignancy are often lacking.	1.7986718596295037
Immunophenotyping of leukocyte differentiation antigens may also be of limited diagnostic value due to the small  number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.	2.417997710279261
Molecular methods may support the specific diagnosis of leptomeningeal infiltration of CLL.	2.2379000278501366
We present an 54 old patient who was diagnosed with CLL five years ago.	2.2877088888922965
Despite clinical signs of leptomeningeal  involvement neither magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nor conventional CSF analysis were suggestive of lymphomatous meningitis.	2.0547044506570713
Using PCR we selectively amplified the highly variable and clone-specific CDR3 region of the locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) in DNA obtained from both CSF and peripheral blood cells.	1.7971614100211528
Analysis of PCR products by high resolution gel electrophoresis revealed a single DNA fragment respectively indicating the presence of a  monoclonal cell population in both  compartments.	1.9964723888534772
DNA sequence analysis of the amplified CDR3 segments confirmed the clonal identity of cells and the leptomeningeal dissemination of CLL.	2.1676039648374363
In the orthopedic department of the University Hospital Homburg/Saar, we use since 1993 a computer-based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations.	2.180837586070366
Hardware consists of DOS/Windows PC's in a Novell-network.	1.9969296431784531
Our software is a combination of datbase-system for managing patient-data and a special coding program for ICD and IKPM-digits.	1.9904679654117157
Our experience shows that computer assisted clinic-management is an effective tool to help the surgeon in planning and documentation.	2.15363040145998
Until now, we used the system for 31 500 patients and 8500 operations.	2.268728840590145
A flexible software can meet the requirements both of the surgeons and administration.	2.194201715662944
Moreover, in the University hospital Homburg/Saar, the different departments are linked by an Intranet with connection to other scientific networks and the Internet.	1.9865356437178452
In one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology, a vulvovaginitis can be diagnosed.	2.1146841287602194
Etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene, foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections.	2.0185940741498984
The microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli, and in case of chronical-recurrent discharge also B. fragilis and peptostreptococci.	2.076100100122437
The symptoms are itching, burning, dysuria, discharge and rubor of the vulva.	1.9296161093057216
A systemic application of antibiotics is not necessary, a local treatment with antibiotic solutions is contraindicated and the usual vaginal suppositories are unsuitable for girls.	2.0447225358645427
A desinfection often irritates the vulvovaginal region of little girls so that for years we use estriol ointment only which is tolerated.	1.810366241648665
Excellently, a single-dose application being sufficient; burning, itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence, so that the healing process is accelerated.	2.1103454255299874
The author gives a short overview of the psychodynamic and psychoanalytic basics of psychotherapy with guided affective imagery.	2.0587366561736617
The differences of the imaginations of neurotic patients and patients with severe personality disorders are demonstrated and discussed.	2.479755851434276
Two clinical cases are described in detail which show the special elements of symbol formation on different levels of ego-structure.	2.1413621863110195
Then the most important results of the recent infant research and the research of attachment behaviour, especially those of the group of Fonagy, and their importance for the theory of symbol formation are discussed.	2.481955278961885
The theory of potential space is used as a base for understanding imaginative processes.	2.2373135879147465
General and special technical recommandations for the treatment of borderline cases with guided affective imagery are derived.	2.3719445496779046
Especially the relationship to the theories of Bion, Ogden and Winnicott is estimated.	2.0193283922046987
The situation of psychiatric patients in the Ukraine is determined by the financial and economic difficulties of this country.	2.3349688193255775
In the larger cities, so-called polyclinics take care of ambulant psychiatric patients.	2.18911316137523
However, no other social psychiatric institutions exist.	2.202362705149862
Here, the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in Kiev and Shitomir as examples.	2.004747262051756
Undertreatment is also a problem, because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the Ukraine.	2.4607171546056095
Import of new psychopharmacological agents is hampered by economical problems.	2.2098581048062673
Improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in Ukraine.	2.025978496517833
Renal lesions are frequently encountered in blunt pediatric abdominal trauma.	2.2767496046285807
In this retrospective study, we analyzed the incidence of renal trauma in these trauma patients to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were most predictive.	2.4611825687516484
From 1976 to 1996, 308 children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department.	2.224431796735741
In specific cases, IV urography, CT scan, and/or angiography were applied.	2.3886212301120575
We used the Organ Injury Scale (OIS) for classification of renal trauma into five grades.	1.9609521806835617
The result of a B-scan ultrasound examination is strongly dependent on the type of the used B-system, the chosen system parameters and the experience and critical analysis of the clinical investigator.	2.43305935970142
The estimation of quantitative acoustic parameters, independent of the type of the used B-system, is one way to overcome the subjective nature and the problems of the interpretation of B-scan images.	2.293867201374219
Results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented.	2.1568940193577224
329 persons were interviewed three times (quantitative study) and 20 persons conducted a semi-structured diary (qualitative study), covering in both groups a two-year period (from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement).	1.8933632639579938
They were asked about their subjective well-being (happiness, joy, satisfaction, stresses), their life situation and their personal, social and material resources.	1.9026675353877671
The results show that the transition to retirement brings with it gains (leisure time) and losses (financial, social status), but overall maintains a high level of well-being.	2.011437354100559
Specific analyses point out inter-individual differences, risk factors and resources, like a high level of trait well-being, health, social networks and an optimistic outlook.	2.0412717792838815
The diary analyses lead to specifications, more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects.	1.9574225952442559
Consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed.	2.2676010411128913
Intraoperative complications can be divided into three categories on the basis of the time of their occurrence: Group I - Problems associated with access; group II: introduction of the endovascular stent (a: release of the main segment, b: anchoring the second limb); and group III: incidence of primary endoleaks.	2.198168266471909
Interferon alpha and gamma have been used to treat several hepatic, hematological and oncological diseases for years.	2.178881109221835
Recently, interferon beta has been introduced as a therapeutic agent in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.	2.1473021827876924
A 41-year-old female patient with multiple sclerosis developed non-tender, palm-sized, cutaneous-subcutaneous, reddish infiltrates at the injection sites on her thighs after 8 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta injections.	1.917772015756462
Histopathology revealed a perivascular lymphoid infiltrate of the dermis and a subtle lobular lymphoid infiltrate of the subcutis.	2.005483533777979
Interferon beta therapy was discontinued for 4 weeks.	2.425870656941079
With topical corticosteroids, the skin lesions resolved.	2.6540590260798704
When subcutaneous injections were resumed at a reduced dose, only erythema around injection sites developed without induration or pain.	1.8861367712695256
Slight erythema and swelling at interferon beta injection site are frequent and rare cases of cutaneous necrosis have been described.	2.1024855997707323
However, no reports of large, painful, cutaneous-subcutaneous infiltrates after interferon beta therapy have been published.	1.9205221988227725
In adults, infectious spondylitis is a rare but severe disease, caused by a bacterial thrombus in tissue of reduced resistance.	2.322310490613264
In conventional radiographs initial findings are a narrowing of the intervertebral space, local osteoporosis and poorly defined erosive borders of the vertebral endplates.	2.1484122528682734
These changings can be found at least three to six weeks after the onset of disease.	2.7884483623738263
However, in Szintigraphy and MRT pathologic alterations are evident after ten to twelve days.	1.8490897189091595
Thus, early diagnosis and treatment becomes possible.	2.8210017070479565
In early stages of the disease a localized lysis surrounded by a reactive sclerosis appears in predisposed areas of the vertebral body (subchondral, anterobasal, ventral, central).	2.005906961594258
Apparently, a soft tissue tumor is associated.	2.6112923124707224
Sclerosis and reduction of the soft tissue tumor are the first signs of repair processes.	2.6430298253011184
After at least 12 weeks, computed tomography can reveal typical sintering of the vertebral body and occasionally the development of a bony sequester.	2.4383585196767563
In addition, MRT as well as CT can be helpful in the detection and localization of complications as abscesses or affection of the vertebral canal.	2.575294368834742
The tuberculous spondylitis can sometimes cause difficulties in differential diagnosis.	2.069624703450099
Clinical findings, affection of several vertebral bodies, large soft tissue tumors with appearance of calcification as well as not typical locations are strongly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis, but these findings are not specific of the disease.	2.0919016655230935
Degenerative disorders such as erosive osteochondrosis or changings due to chronic dialysis (e. g. amyloid or crystal arthropathies) may cause even more problems in differential diagnosis.	1.9447553510667375
Typical for a blastomatous process is the integrity of the interverebral disc space, which is a rare finding in spondylitis.	2.603430929394254
To show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot.	2.1831679141326767
We examinated 10 cadaver foots of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial 20 healthy patients with 10 to 20-MHz-probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region.	1.9068134118862186
Especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic (saving of expenses, lack of radiation, side-to-side comparison).	2.2170709571048586
An essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment (melanins).	1.9282329155092246
Toxicological studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration.	2.3591166973731634
As the available vocabulary for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the viewer, it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow objectivation of hair colour.	2.1962036264934404
The natural hair colour of 17 subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart (Wella, Darmstadt, Germany).	1.8454782724344225
Subsequently the colours of the hair and the samples of the hair colour chart used for comparison were measured by colorimetric analysis and the CIEL*a*b* values were determined.	2.16277941818758
The descriptive categorisation of the hair colours (e.g.	2.2819506519537334
blonde, brown, black) could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results.	2.013471414431519
Sometimes considerable differences were also found between the colour values of the natural hair samples and the specimens used for comparison.	2.262711171947913
When the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible.	2.6442145197187172
We measured the ventilatory pattern and additional work of breathing (WOBadd) at three different levels of inspiratory pressure support [IPS 5, 10, 15 mbar above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)] and in a new ventilatory mode, automatic tube compensation (ATC), in nine operative patients without lung injury nine patients ventilated for several following acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).	1.8306014348320887
Pressure support in this mode, i. e. airway pressure above PEEP, is equal to the actual flow-dependent pressure drop across the endotracheal tube (ETT).	2.066314706521968
Airway pressure rises at the beginning of inspiration and falls towards the end.	2.359821720187494
As the tube resistance of ETT seriously hinders expiration and can cause desynchronization between ventilator and patient, airway pressure is reduced below PEEP during expiration in the same way as it is increased during inspiration.	1.866528086553354
This mode could be best termed as "electronic extubation".	2.1310304851998483
The most striking difference between the postoperative patients and the ARI patients was their minute ventilation (17.8+/-1.85 l/min in ARI patients vs 7.3+/-3.1 l/min in the postoperative patients).	2.255284558098407
In the postoperative patients augmentation of IPS from 5 to 15 mbar induced a steady increase in tidal volume (VT) and a consecutive decrease in respiratory rate (rr) compared with ATC (VTATC,postop= 463+/-78 ml; rrATC,postop =16+/-4 min-1; VTIPS5,postop = 505+/-79 ml; rrIPS5,postop = 15+/-4 min-1; VTIPS10,postop = 562+/-86 ml; rrIPS15,postop =14+/-4 min-1; VTIPS15,postop=660+/- 151 ml; rrTPS15, postop = 12+/-4 min-1), whereas the augmentation of IPS of 5 and 10 mbar in the ARI patients could not compensate for the increase in rr and the decrease in VT, after switching from ATC to IPS (VTATC,ARI 724+/-308 ml, rrATC,ARI = 24+/-6 min-1; VTIPS5,ARI = 649+/-315 ml; rrIPS 5,ARI = 27+/-8 min-1; VTIPS10,ARI=653+/-353 ml; rrIPS10,ARI = 25+/-8 min-1: Even IPS 15 was not able to reestablish VT at the values observed during ATC (VTIPS15,ARI =680+/-312 ml).	1.783036828010953
During ATC WOBadd was small in both postoperative and ARI patients (WOBadd,ATC,postop = 93+/-36 mJ/l, WOBadd,ATC,ARI =116 +/-72 mJ/l).	1.9246553496057177
In the postoperative patients, an inspiratory pressure support of 5 mbar was not sufficient to compensate WOBadd compared with ATC.	2.125429301304049
However, IPS 10 and 15 mbar were able to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd.ATC5,postop WOBadd,IPS5,postop =189+/-77 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS10,postop = 55+/-30 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS15,postop = 21+/-11 mJ/l).	1.8605397618848054
In the ARI patients an IPS 5, 10 or 15 mbar was not sufficient to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd,IPS 5,ARI = 1126+/-262 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 10,ARI 863+/-253 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 15,ARI 763+/-298 mJ/l).	1.804452574533263
Under ATC, WOBadd was only 15% of WOBadd under IPS of 15 mbar.	2.0517295888865994
All but two patients were successfully extubated after the investigation.	2.508892439054768
These two patients were not extubated because they were dependent on an FIO2 >0.5.	2.2536573137117686
Our results strongly indicate that ventilatory dependence in ARI patients may be caused by the ETT rather than by mechanical dysfunction of the lung.	2.489125909155318
ATC is a very helpful mode to use in distinguishing between ventilatory failure caused by ETT and real ventilatory dependence.	2.1242432677678895
The preoperative localization of pharmaco-resistent focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance.	2.0561106809602796
In addition to conventional MRI diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HMR spectroscopy) can be useful for assessing the bilaterality of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	2.023234996862088
The technique and findings of HMR spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	2.42970584799003
The findings indicate that chemical shift imaging (CSI) investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery.	1.9136020785508618
This paper describes the conceptual considerations in planning and realizing an inpatient unit for traumatized patients.	1.9145810274216764
The different concepts of the dynamic of the traumatic disease and the aetiopathology of posttraumatic stressdisease (PTSD) are highly significant in regard to the realisation of differing concepts of inpatient therapy of trauma.	2.032193702557233
The utilisation of Konzentrative Bewegungstherapy (KBT) and Creative Therapy in our conflict- and solution-oriented analytic concept permits us to neglect a fictitious contradiction between traumaexposure and traumalimitation and a "potential space" (Winnicott) can be opened to the creative work with the patients.	1.732307828287911
This paper illustrates with some casuistic examples the utilisation of KBT in transforming the traumatic body-flashbacks into narrative memory-scripts, by the use of symbolizing processes.	1.880554228579321
In 55 consecutive patients with the same dual chamber pacemaker (Relay, Intermedics) and different pacing leads, the influence of different safety margins for pacing on battery current was investigated.	2.1665018661071542
2.8 +/- 0.9 years after implantation, atrial and ventricular pulse-width thresholds (tRS) (ms) were determined at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 V, and the charge delivered at threshold was telemetered.	2.0938751259863704
If tRS was <1.50 ms at 0.5 V, an amplitude of 1.0 V was programmed in the atrium and the ventricule; if tRS was <1.50 ms at 1.0 V, then an amplitude of 2.0 V was chosen.	1.7583570081821125
Two times the charge threshold (2x QRS), two times the voltage threshold (2x URS), and three times the pulse-width threshold (3x tRS) were programmed as the safety margins for pacing.	2.0665669410206466
With every safety margin, battery current (IRS) (µA) was averaged from 5 telemetric readings in D00 mode with 70 bpm.	1.8313564295507994
IBat was significantly lower with 2x QRS as compared with 2x URS (13.43 +/- 1.0 vs. 14.20 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (13.99 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.05).	1.9129408517842053
Pacemaker longevity derived from these current data was significantly longer with 2x QRS (112 +/- 8 months) as compared with 2x URS (106 +/- 9, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (108 +/- 8, p<0.05).	2.1122024841459255
If current consumption is compared intraindividually in dependance on the programmed amplitude, battery current is significantly lower at 1.0 V as compared with 2.0 V resulting in a mean reduction of 0.63 µA (-4.9%, p<0.05) and an average gain in longevity of 5 months.	1.955606793920337
This applies to every safety margin tested.	2.3751896671898005
Differences in battery current caused by the safety margins will translate into a greater gain in longevity in future pacemaker models with reduced internal current consumption.	1.9854552222956554
Any medical procedure must be legally authorized by the patient, giving informed consent.	2.4916771686273305
This prerequisite is based on the right to self determination.	3.2798841586845677
Otherwise a medical procedure is considered as physical injury.	2.486526434125805
Thus, the way, how a specific procedure is performed, predominantly depends on the patient's will.	2.4719028802042784
The attending physician's duty is to find out this will, which is especially important when old patients and patients incapable of giving valid consent are involved.	2.1446141427444094
Before the procedure the physician has to have a confidential talk with the patient.	2.485484413107014
He has to point out the best treatment possible considering the individual circumstances of the patient's life.	2.391767966952609
The physician has to find out, weather the patient is competent to refuse or consent to treatement.	2.3297172711910474
Furthermore the consultation is an opportunity to diminish the patient's fear and to increase his confidence.	2.0281396329920756
The main problem treating old patients is that they often lack the mental ability for appreciation of the nature of the situation.	2.089680890859748
One has to differentiate between the physiological mental decay and dementia or psychiatric diseases.	2.2792062588864526
In these cases a third party consent is necessary.	2.189674783012645
A brief discussion of the scientific accomplishments of German neurologists during this time is followed by a description of violations of ethical principles, exemplified by the human experiments of G. Schaltenbrand.	1.9750203189879474
The spirit of the age exerted a malevelent influence.	2.2317334415041135
A postal survey targeted at 1000 firms in the metal- and electronic working industry of Northrhine Westfalia was carried out by Sozialforschungsstelle Dortmund und Institute of geronotology to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement.	1.886958774387386
As the results show, firms in Northrhine Westfalia are willing to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve.	1.881587176175533
Firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement.	2.253124959164269
Therefore partial retirement is created as a so-called "blocked model".	2.4151295669824844
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients had a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implanted.	2.1976731949957675
Mean age was 64  +/-  9 years, 278 male and 62 female.	2.2384717935767218
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was in 57% of patients ventricular tachycardia, in 43% ventricular fibrillation.	2.0525720250032564
In 25 patients additional subcutaneous patch or array electrodes and in 2 patients additional epicardial patch electrodes were implanted.	2.0372624760553406
Implantation site was in 92 patients abdominal and in 248 pectoral.	2.164880482046985
Over a period of 7 years 34 lead-related complications occured in 33 patients (9.7%), after a median of 2 months after implantation.	2.1916635630434245
Diagnosis was made by routine chest x-ray in about 55% of lead-related complications, by clinical presentation (inadequate therapy, pain) in 24%, and by electrical parameters in 21%.	2.0519667931985484
In patients with an abdominal implantation site, lead-related complications occurred in 20%, in contrast to 6% in patients with a pectoral implantation site.	2.863146894686114
Regarding patients with pectoral implantation site, lead-related complications were observed in 12% of patients with a dual-chamber ICD vs 4% with a single-chamber ICD (p = 0.05), due to dislocation of atrial electrodes with dual-chamber ICD.	2.5480444371464617
There were no differences in clinical parameters between patients with pectoral vs abdominal and between single vs dual-chamber ICD.	1.982254965113498
Several new approaches are available for early defibrillation.	2.6594638485926643
One example is semiautomatic defibrillators used by the first arriving emergency staff.	2.1828102561072615
The recommendations for introducing emergency medical technician (EMT) defibrillation in Germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor-manned-ambulances or the experiences of the German multi-center-study.	1.9519807001881144
This analysis intends to contribute data to an EMT defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous-system.	1.9781414773378245
Methods: In a prospective study a EMT-defibrillation group (= DG) was compared with a standard group (basic life support by EMTs and defibrillation by emergency physicians) (= SG) and a control group (emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with EMTs) (= CG).	2.058069361246611
In the DG semiautomatic defibrillators from Laerdal (Heartstart 3000) were used.	2.033449523866178
Results: Over 13 months 43 patients were included, primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation (VF).	2.0922218839642044
Depending on the first arriving emergency staff the patients were allocated to the DG (n = 12), to the SG (n = 18) or to the CG (n = 13).	2.2063121055168846
DG and SG did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long-term prognosis (primary successful 8.3% vs. 38.9%, definite successful 0% vs. 27.8%).	2.0294503927980836
The primary survival rate in the DG was significantly lower than in the CG (8.3% vs. 61.5%).	2.396051308154109
In the long term survival rate there were no significant differences.	2.6358731562066953
In the DG significantly less patients received bystander CPR (8.3%) than in the other groups (55.6% and 69.2%).	2.1191535523205176
Neither the variable "witnessed collapes" nor "bystander CPR" had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study.	2.4519300711777396
Conclusions: A comparison of this study with American, European and German recommendations for EMT defibrillation programms revealed some deviations.	2.211438604337864
Bystander CPR seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician.	2.8489579055884096
A benefit of EMT defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our "rendezvous-system", possibly because the time interval was less than 4 min (3.5 min).	2.303626763328084
Since the result is in accordance with the German multi-center-study, a critical consideration of a EMT defibrillation program seems to be necessary in "Rendezvous-systems".	2.259637675068266
Ninety-two strains of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) from 80 patients of 31 hospitals in 11 federal states were analyzed.	1.808786350825665
They were primarily isolated in intensive care units (general, surgical, internistic, pediatric, oncological ones), but also in nephrologic/dialysis or neurologic/orthopaedic wards.	2.0250538454699605
A dominance of VanA type E. faecium strains was observed (n=81; 88.0%).	2.0125130679090373
In addition, strains of E. faecalis (VanA; n=4; 4.4%), E. faecium (VanB; n=1; 1.1%), and E. gallinarum (VanC1, n=6; 6.5%) were found.	1.9156719559284952
The 81 VanA strains of E. faecium possessed the following resistances to other antibiotics: erythromycin, ciprofloxacin (both 93.8%), ampicillin, oxytetracycline (both 88.9%), rifampicin (79.0%), trimethoprim/sulfameracin (61.7%), chloramphenicol (18.9%), fusidic acid (12.3%), quinupristin/dalfopristin (7.4%); gentamicin (46.9%) and streptomycin (37.0%), also together with ampicillin resistance (9.9-35.8%).	1.5181240863822105
In some of these VanA type strains resistance to teicoplanin cannot be completely expressed in-vitro.	2.118457728523608
Macrorestriction analysis of E. faecium outbreak isolates (VanA type) from hospitals in different federal states indicated an intra- and interhospital spread of a defined strain.	1.9481469490385814
However, heterogeneous plasmid and plasmid restriction patterns showed that these strains were not completely identical.	1.9165188401759539
The scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle, mostly associated with polytraumatized critically ill patients.	2.426285318885115
This case report of 3 patients shows the variety of possible injuries combined with SD.	2.2938321342481993
Diagnosis and therapy in such a rare trauma, which is most likely seen in specialized trauma centres are being described.	2.3463260042222793
The 3 patients are presented from trauma to management, with remarks to various possibilities in treatment.	2.1249570715788213
Reports of other groups include multicenter studies with small numbers of patients, making it different to look for homogenity or defining standards, whereas current guidelines are being mentioned, including remarks on the management of these mostly polytraumatized and vitally endangered patients.	1.8652783580734067
This is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56-year-old male.	2.3339643273092396
Recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis, as the patient could not remember any trauma.	2.6940318677320447
After performing MRI, a 12 x 5 mm signal-free zone showed up in the area of the lateral condylus femoris, which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed.	2.2011313900725122
The patient was discharged soon after without any complaints.	2.140783915098687
Many patients with acquired strabismus do not suffer from diplopia and confusion after an individually and age-dependent interval.	1.97767035170527
They inhibit the image of the deviated eye by binocular rilvary and particularly by the physiological ability to disregard visually disturbing stimuli.	1.9331052720414983
Red cells, platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma of a single donation contain leucocytes, causing a lot of side effects.	2.0510258895598694
Modern filtration- and apheresis-techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of <1x106 per unit.	2.285959178694165
The best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised prestorage-filtration.	1.9336456706800054
This is an effective method, to prevent cytokine-mediated and leucocyte-mediated febrile nonhaemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), to prevent a primary immunisation to leucocyte- and histocompatibility-antigens, to avoid transmission of viral infections by blood transfusion, e.g.	1.894629281998003
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and to exclude in special cases bacterial septicaemia.	2.434052875007415
The use of leucocyte-depleted blood components for special indications is meanwhile established.	2.00458763639163
Some European countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes.	2.0619529776167176
The authors recommend the general leucocyte-depletion of blood components considering the German medical law (AMG) and cost/benefit ratio.	1.8594146063575205
This study demonstrates on 309 psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy and followed-up 1 year after treatment that defensiveness, measured with validity scales of personality inventories MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gießen-Test, influences ratings (scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES) before and after therapy.	1.714460668295523
Patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up.	1.9009852631153363
The extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in frankness in these patients, indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales.	2.3774192085459966
Inpatient client-centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self-criticism and diminished it in the case of initial retentiveness.	2.3770271430182746
Introduction: Because of their frequency and consequences sciatica remains a demanding clinical entity with significant social and economical impact.	1.976561289449276
There is a high demand on therapeutic modalities, using folk medicine methods in the treatment of orthopaedic  diseases.	2.5026201993333217
No data is available on the usefullness of methods like natural herbs in combination with acupuncture.	2.353295162118528
Aim of our study was to present data on the effect of acupuncture and cytokineinhibiting natural herbs in sciatic pain.	2.467063174645229
We compared these  results with nerve root infiltration by local anaesthetics and corticosteroids in our  orthopaedic outpatient clinic.	2.0301997567338215
Materials and Results: 278 patients with chronic pain for at least 3 months were observed.	2.3809192435449433
All three therapeutical modalities showed improvement of pain scores.	2.202414797783624
Sole Mepivacain-HCl treatment had significant less pain reduction compared to the other treatment modalities.	2.300772908600004
Conclusion: According to our results acupuncture in combination with herbs and  steroid nerve blocks appear to be an effective and thus recommendable conservative  therapy in cases of sciatic pain.	2.4616007571479894
Taking into account that patients increasingly prefer ethnomedical modalities of treatment our study gains importance for practising  orthopaedists.	1.9031871499377977
This paper concerns advances in the integration of psychotherapy in psychiatric education and clinical practice and whether they go along with increasing research activities.	2.090893370407108
To find answers, a survey on psychotherapy research was carried out in all German psychiatric hospitals and departments by means of a questionnaire.	2.2477986186337224
The results indicate that psychotherapy research is done nearly exclusively in university hospitals.	2.1401714434855914
About half of them had already published psychotherapy studies and two thirds of them are presently carrying out studies, mostly including prospective, randomized clinical trials.	2.1216561571535406
These studies cover the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders: substance abuse, schizophrenic and affective disorders, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive and personality disorders.	1.9553922401078567
To improve psychotherapy research conditions further, efforts are necessary to increase scientific exchange, financial support, and the integration of institutions outside the universities.	2.2438522589418386
There is little to suggest that the course of preeclamsia can be substantially affected by drug treatment.	2.4326493636747624
The vast majority of randomized studies do not indicate beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria, fetal heart rate abnormalities, abruptio placentae and the incidence of preterm birth.	2.0828476135433065
There is also no definite effect on the development of superimposed preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, renal failure or eclampsia.	2.3755386163601235
Moreover, blood pressure lowering agents fail to improve uteroplacental perfusion but may have adverse effects on fetal growth.	2.0962111887984087
Antihypertensive treatment is only indicated in severe hypertension ( > 170/110 mm Hg) to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage.	2.3527438173275868
Dihydralazine injections may result in reduced placental blood flow and fetal distress.	2.436957362566456
Oral nifedipine offers some advantages in view of more potent vasodilator actions on uterine and fetoplacental vessels and a lower incidence of fetal distress.	2.030776205460329
Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism of eclamptic seizure is cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant ischemia.	2.1738769149073143
Cerebral vessels are particularly sensitive to magnesium, which works by reversing cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant improvement in blood flow.	1.9410456768070765
Controlled trials have shown magnesium to be superior to both placebo and phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia.	2.2520097012834395
Furthermore, magnesium has been found to be more effective than diazepam and phenytoin in preventing recurrence of seizures in women with eclampsia.	2.1406594273076127
Also the neonatal outcome favors magnesium, which is now generally accepted as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.	2.585105435204974
Baker's cysts were treated operatively in 19 patients in the Department of Traumatology of the University of Cologne from 1988 to 1997.	2.6118876516768714
The subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography (follow-up: 95 %).	2.648093518622887
All patients were examinated before surgery, sonography and X-ray of the knee were performed.	2.517978096498061
We differentiated between the congenital primary cyst (39 %), and the secondary form, which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion (61 %).	2.72301390235984
Arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of Baker's cyst.	2.673850684187153
Postoperative complications were two reinterventions due to one hematoma and one effusion.	2.096943586282927
Patient's evaluation of operation result was "excellent" in 61 % and "good" in 39 % of cases.	2.1485305741107967
All knee joints had a full range of motion.	2.6211483327478686
There was only one case of a recurrent cyst.	3.046743654326841
The primary form of Baker's cyst has always to be extirpated, according to our clinical experience.	2.1973813548424705
The extirpation of the secondary Baker's cyst and the relevance of arthroscopy and treatment of the basic disease have to be discussed.	2.7350851061409576
In median avcuate ligament syndrome, compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.	2.184416050019917
A lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment.	2.428867391007774
Depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways, the symptoms vary considerably.	2.440579919814554
We report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two-vessel involvement.	2.0740117684441914
In such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit.	2.239617814967923
Usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient.	2.2486572519560353
Bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow.	2.170183286823282
The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique.	2.279619886820768
However, the expertise required is a major disadvantage.	2.377514643014624
Recently, methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available.	2.0707474415580704
The use of an antigen-capture assay for the detection of histidine-rich protein 2, an antigen specific for Plasmodium falciparum, forms the basis of the ParaSight-F (Becton Dickinson) and the ICT Malaria Pf test (ICT Diagnostics).	1.9360340250471648
Parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another immunographic dipstick assay developed by Flow Inc.	2.3289461309912847
These currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and specificities of 90-100%.	2.2729630469330915
A decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low parasitemia.	2.791197193349506
However, false-negative  results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities.	2.7123887484102487
Purpose: Discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes.	2.442945260638396
There is no information about the frequency of nerve lesions after revascularization of the lower limb.	2.7291932926127336
Methods: Between 1992 and 1996, 436 patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization, including 147 cases of deep revascularization, 127 supra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses, 116 infra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses and 56 femoro-crural bypasses.	1.6878367554933036
Mean patient age was 70.5 +/- 5.8 years; 182 patients were female and 254 were male.	2.0052136383053742
There was a 38% rate (166/436) of reoperation.	2.0020762674253927
All patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation, including the methods of Weber and Moberg.	2.100375593320303
Results: We found eleven patients (4%) with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation.	2.52353575479154
Conclusions: Peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15% of our patients on discharge from hospital.	2.385789048449376
They had mainly dysesthesia and hypesthesia but no kind of motor dysfunction.	2.0043925679152
In our opinion, detailed preoperative information is very important because of the risk of sensitive nerve lesions.	2.5395921745717085
Classic and HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) are predominantly found in male Caucasians.	2.115854503670012
It is unclear why KS is so rare in women.	2.1687059272044755
At the Department of Dermatology, University of Frankfurt, epidemic KS was diagnosed in 299/751 (40%) male and 5/72 (18%) female HIV-infected patients.	2.047945700392659
To detect common parameters regarding immunodeficiency, hormonal disturbances, abnormalities in clinical course, or sexual practices, data of eight women with KS (five HIV+, three HIV-) were compared.	1.954794580951703
In HIV+ women KS is more aggressive than in HIV- women and more aggressive than in HIV+ men.	2.0981224887242695
Early and frequent visceral involvement and no preference for the lower extremities are found.	2.2852448041799054
Compared to HIV- women with KS, HIV+ women are generally younger (mean age 38 vs 71 years) and significantly immunodeficient (reduced absolute CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio).	1.9135685829734854
All women with KS investigated for sexual hormones (7/8) showed abnormalities: 7/7 had low oestrogens, 4/6 low LH and 3/5 low progesterone.	1.8550844340615797
Controls (n=11, HIV+ without KS) showed a clear trend for higher serum levels of sexual hormones, but the difference was not significant.	2.156511422266119
Although different reasons for low levels of oestrogens (drug abuse, marasmus, menopause) must be considered, the lack of oestrogens seems to be a common finding in HIV+ and HIV- women with KS.	2.3104783700143674
There was no correlation between sexual practices (anal or oral-faecal contacts) and the manifestation or aggressiveness of KS.	1.9939547433490288
The aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement (AVR) due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired LV systolic function prior to surgery.	2.3566918749161654
74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (29 female, 45 male, mean age 66  +/-  18 years) were divided into 2 groups according to LV ejection fraction (EF): Group 1 with EF > 50% (n = 40); Group 2 with EF <= 50% (n = 34).	2.0838722460028594
Furthermore, patients were differentiated into a group A without (n = 53) and a group B with aortic regurgitation (<= II °, n = 21).	2.233830357196092
All patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 month after surgery.	2.4600200218249837
There was a significant decrease of LV enddiastolic and endsystolic valume indices following AVR in group 2 and group B.	2.0018656361971496
Patients with preoperatively lower EF (group 2) showed an increase in LV ejection fraction from 39  +/-  10% before AVR to 47  +/-  11% after AVR (p < 0.001), whereas patients with preoperative normal EF (group 1) showed a significant decrease in EF (from 62  +/-  8% to 57  +/-  10%, p < 0.05).	2.296821501880729
Also patients with combined aortic valve disease before AVR had an increase of EF after surgery (from 45 %plusmn; 14% to 56  +/-  14%, p < 0.03).	2.066844935779416
There were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and LV posterior wall thickness in group 1 and group A, whereas a significant decrease of LV anddiastolic diameter index was noted only in group B.	1.9601466513812502
In conclusion, patients with impaired LV function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after AVR, while patients with normal LV function presented a slight decrease of EF.	2.1683834718478048
There was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status.	2.427225746180634
Cardiomyocytes lose the ability to proliferate after birth.	2.5809403377673656
Subsequently, irreversible cellular damage, e.g., during myocardial infarction, causes loss of functional properties and cell replacement by fibrotic tissue.	2.137050450751834
It is, therefore, not surprising that cell replacement strategies such as cardiomyocyte transplantation in damaged myocardium or scar tissue has gained widespread interest.	1.943573174173059
In other species such as mice, rats, and dogs, the technical feasibility of skeletal myoblast-, satellite cell-, and fetal cardiomyocyte engraftment into normal and diseased myocardium has been demonstrated by simple injection methods.	1.852060062650982
Repeatedly, it has been shown that transplanted cells may survive for weeks within host myocardium and build intercellular connections such as grap junctions and desmosomes.	2.050316272453853
In contrast, grafthost connections have not, as yet, been convincingly demonstrated.	2.0115839369364554
Hypothetically, cell transplants might exhibit the following functional properties: stabilization of diseased tissue to prevent structural remodeling; carrier for recombinant proteins, growth factors or drugs to induce molecular alterations of host myocardium; and improvement of regional and global myocardial function due to active contractility.	1.7335034941557121
However, clear evidence of coordinated contractility of transplanted cells, and, thus, of a clinically relevant therapeutical use of cardiomyocyte transplantation as a replacement strategy for damaged host cardiac cells, remains to be demonstrated.	1.9827396003289073
Concomitant with advances in medicine, involving the development and use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, organ / stem cell transplantation and pre-existing illnesses such as AIDS, the frequency of fungal infection has increased dramatically.	2.177134449339524
These factors determine the susceptibility of the lung for an acute or chronic course of disease.	2.4157835605005604
Purpose: We evaluated the speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) at the os calcis as an indicator of osteoporosis and observed the age-related changes in ultrasound values in normal women.	2.0123695551932745
Materials and methods: BUA and SOS were measured in 236 women using the "Achilles" densitometer (Lunar, Madison, Ohio).	1.7905239135815234
From the BUA and SOS values the BUA/SOS Index ("Stiffness" Index) is calculated.	1.9359961799108878
We investigated 55 female patients with osteoporosis (aged 43-85 years) and 181 healthy women (aged 20-80 years).	2.043213457163639
Results: Ultrasound values for women with osteoporosis were significantly lower than those for the normal control group.	2.2552145152221827
The Z-score compared with young normals was higher for the BUA/SOS Index (-3.1) than for BUA (-2.5) and SOS (-3.0).	1.7852708355445253
At a BUA/SOS Index of 68 the sensitivity was 85 %, and the specificity was 77 % for patients with osteoporotic fractures.	2.401597582620562
We found a significant decline with age in SOS (r = -0.55), BUA (r = -0.50) and BUA/SOS Index (r = -0.57).	1.9172775752977322
Conclusion: Ultrasound bone densitometry at the os calcis can be used as a screening test in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	2.572323616616451
Because of demographic development and the progress of medicine, the number of patients who are not able to give their consent is increasing.	2.7364135782832926
In practice, we make do with the presumed consent of the patient or, for procedures that can wait, with the consent of legitimate family members.	2.125946616177677
An initiative action is suggested by physicians and hospitals that should reduce this gray zone and the forensic risks drastically.	1.9559040039231328
A number of studies has shown a significant relationship between life events/life conditions and depression.	2.1334594447887834
However, there is only a small number of studies investigating the effect of life events/life conditions in patients with severe depression from the endogenous subtype.	2.7912976372798846
The present study examines the significance of the patients' life events/life conditions for the two year outcome of the illness in a prospective study with assessments every three months.	2.583148849579671
Patients are compared to healthy controls with regard to the period three months prior to the admission to the hospital at the index episode.	2.518196128110001
The results confirm the importance of life events and life conditions for the long term outcome of depressed patients with endogenous subtype respectively severe major depression in-patients.	2.3607429060707052
Relapsers show considerably more undesirable life conditions than non-relapsers three to six months prior to their relapse.	2.056318932565458
Depressed patients indicate significantly more undesirable life events and life conditions and fewer desirable life conditions in comparison to the control group for the time span three months prior to their hospitalisation.	2.215808333416978
Since the availability of protease inhibitors in 1997, there has been a great change in antiretroviral therapy but also new long term side effects have emerged, mainly metabolic changes such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterinemia and hyperglycemia.	1.9464213942914612
Besides, fat redistribution has been observed.	2.2836445916526547
Fat wastes in the face and limbs but accumulates in the adipose tissue of the dorsocervical and abdominal region and the breasts.	2.05892196470782
The mechanism of these changes remains unclear.	2.5164161859294336
For therapy a protease inhibitor free therapy or lipid lowering drugs may be tried.	1.9853111571639883
29 of our 224 patients developed lipodystrophy.	2.388887386780676
27 of these patients had been treated with a protease inhibitor (17 patients with indinavir); 2 of the patients had never received protease inhibitors.	2.626073511328562
Background: The Low-Vision-Enhancement-System (LVESR) is the first binocular optoelectronic rehabilitation device with variable focus distance.	2.0198682092913267
DNA-cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the WHO-classification.	2.7657750204502496
In this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three recurrencies were investigated.	2.1349411479050358
In all cases the histological type and WHO-grade and the Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index were determined.	1.8933103185955298
DNA cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on Feulgen-stained preparations, and the following parameters were calculated: stemline ploidy, 5c-exceeding rate, and 2c-deviation index.	1.9923928249573226
There is a world-wide renaissance of neurosurgical treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD), based on substantial progress in basic sciences.	1.911537076271986
A model of parallel motor circuitry has identified potential targets for lesioning by clarifying the pathophysiological role of the basal ganglia in PD.	1.9647995119127226
The internal globus pallidus (Gpi) is an essential player as it connects to thalamocortical projections and can be disinhibited by overactivity of the nucleus subthalamicus (Nst).	1.9509484992561592
Lesioning of these targets has been successful in MPTP damaged primates.	2.123046869126717
There is clinical use of destructive as well as restorative and stimulative technics.	2.695227884137055
Pallidotomy and thalamatomy have evolved by the use of better neuroradiological and electrophysiological targeting.	2.40252174089449
The first technic is used for treatment of rigidity, hypokinesia and dyskinesias, the latter one has proven to be efficient for tremor.	2.2470525207161733
Dopaminergic reinnervation and increased dopaminergic output of the striatum has only been seen after transplantation of fetal cells; this method however carries immunological and ethical problems.	1.9223364516054398
The continuous high frequency stimulation of basal ganglia is the newest technic; it is highly adaptable to the patient's need and carries a low morbidity profile.	1.9169443067862806
The stimulation of Nst and Gpi are proposed for dyskinesias and on/off phenomena.	1.9003601423636807
Animal research further focuses on xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent precursor cells.	1.956983745364425
- In summary neurosurgical procedures seem to be verey promising; however longterm comparison studies are needed to define the best (combination) treatment(s) for the future.	2.2012564038349036
Concepts of documentation rely not only on the contents required and technical demands, but the procedures covered and in medical applications especially security aspects are also matters of critical concern.	2.017252956288275
Even though the need for effective documentation (i.e., adequate in content, availability, feasibility and easy to retrieve analysis) is not a question, tasks and aims (for example, quality of patient care) deserve attention and establishing efforts have to be analyzed regarding their structural and personal prerequisites and implications before particular tools for documentation can be developed.	1.9699761510614031
The Medtronic Thera/Thera-i (and Kappa 400) pacemakers utilize a mode switching algorithm that switches from the DDD/R mode to the DDIR mode in the presence on an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	1.7806322932532876
To accomplish this, the pacemaker keeps track of a mean atrial rate (MAR) which is a weighted index of the atrial rate.	2.1924938126443947
Once the MAR is greater than the programmed mode switch rate the pacemaker mode switches to the nontracking mode.	1.9251487776875458
Additionally, the algorithm provides a long PVARP and a rate adaptive (RA) AV interval.	1.9972919968556064
These not only help ensure that a wide range of atrial rates will be detected, but may also limit the time the patient tracks at the upper rate before mode switching.	2.0491139152976534
In order to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, the Thera-i provides detailed diagnostics which provide information on the date, time, duration, and rate of the mode switch episodes.	2.2790459823155023
Additionally, more detailed beat-to-beat information is provided for each episode which can help determine its appropriateness and can assist in making programming changes.	1.9757980097346821
There is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases.	2.5137726759563424
For dermatological patients such data are not available.	2.4672737522891213
In early spring 1998 we studied the psychological changes in 247 hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the Ruhr University Bochum.	2.0766073126151654
We found the prevalance of psychological alterations ranged between 25,9% and 31%.	2.0530732778710683
The prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological, cardiological or neurological patient populations.	2.0349119437926517
Surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or angiological diseases.	2.427593816985484
These results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated.	2.0863025288626478
In an analysis of 3,838 restrained car drivers, the proportion of acceleration related injury of the cervical spine increased from under 10 % in 1985 to over 30 % in 1997.	2.114622629537294
These injuries occurred mainly in the case of head-on or multiple collisions.	2.4915476062352506
Letters were sent to 1,136 of the injured persons, and of the 138 patients who returned the questionnaires, 121 (88 %) were still suffering from their symptoms.	2.061709251755294
It was a question of pain (74 %), tension (6 %) and stiffness (5 %) in the head (27 %), neck (55 %) and shoulder (8 %) area.	2.4306470042257877
The duration of the complaints was the longest after multiple collisions.	2.2264570657194462
In addition to a slight influence of the accompanying injuries on the duration of complaints, the individual constitution seems to be an important determining factor.	2.5994867419658387
In order to resolve the difficulties of conducting of this retrospective study, prospective studies are necessary which include documentation of diagnosis, treatment protocols, duration and type of complaints.	2.1125667638345265
Large B-cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non-Hodgkin-lymphomas (30-40%).	2.60947043300378
They are characterised by an aggressive clinical course.	2.427388823941874
These lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma.	2.23110141819841
In addition to primary nodal, a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common.	2.0953253911043572
The neoplastic cells, even within one given case, show a broad morphological spectrum.	2.117439027785759
Several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large B-cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group.	2.382982008207527
This fact has been taken into account by the new WHO classification of malignant lymphomas.	2.3786576448721624
There are two groups identified, that of the variants and that of the subtypes.	2.509036241416873
The various variants (centroblastic, immunoblastic, anaplastic, T-cell/histiocyte-rich) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical, immunophenotypical and genetic findings.	1.73835102116393
In contrast, the primary mediastinal, the intravascular, the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities.	2.014425129709705
A number of recently described large cell lymphoma types, i. e. plasmablastic, ALK-positive and primary gastric, are included in the classification, their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion.	2.0080176493063218
In the presented study, knee joint proprioception of 43 patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated.	2.5307000760351914
We tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test.	2.073938195510494
Additionally, all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage.	2.379229274407651
The patient group showed significant deterioration of angle reproduction capability (13.2  °  +/-  6.1  °) compared to the control group (7.8  °  +/-  2.8  °).	2.0969220943765525
After applying an elastic knee bandage, the angle reproduction capability significantly improved to 9.2  °  +/-  4.5  °.	1.9778478535791697
Proprioception of the contralateral, noninvolved knee joint in the patients (11.6  °  +/-  6.3  °) was worse compared to the control group.	2.3841832722687744
Applying an elastic knee bandage did not significantly improve the proprioception of the uninjured knee joint.	2.125809326433518
Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men.	2.7064324121034553
It is associated with a two-fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers.	2.557191293418156
The relative inefficacy and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies.	1.8694628244036455
Ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two alternate strategies: ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	1.9706202827583261
It has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus.	2.156548212006985
These ectopic foci can be mapped and ablated, thereby removing the substrate for initiation of atrial fibrillation.	1.964153637781768
Most often, these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins.	2.44031409910857
A challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study.	1.8295518049421646
To sidestep the need of mapping, pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions.	2.0036772238104663
In patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation, efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	2.025952383637222
Strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant wavelets requiring a critical myocardial mass to perpetuate.	2.1446284500075365
Several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative compartmentalization of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation.	1.8460483336131503
Currently, attempts were made to reproduce the surgical technique using transveneous, catheter-based approaches.	2.096464075544335
Though our knowledge of ablation techniques and technical prerequisites is continuously increasing, the difficulty to produce complete linear lesions in the left atrium and local thrombus formation at the ablation line are problems that are still not solved.	2.0051031502201706
Using a time-budget method in a 3 year longitudinal study with a control group design, substantial reductions in the engagement of non-obligatory instrumental, social, and leisure activities could be found in a group of mildly to moderately demented patients.	2.061956503408698
Controlling these changes for differences in baseline paramters, the dementia-specific reduction was about 1,5 hours compared to a non-psychiatric control group.	2.24071964962788
These clinically relevant changes in activity levels underscore the importance of these activity domains with regard to the development of diagnostically useful indicators at the early stages of dementia.	2.478425244742939
Time-budget methods seem to be particularly useful to close the diagnostic gap with regard to the assessment of everyday competence indicators especially at early stages of the dementia illness.	2.348250774412687
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease with different etiological, morphological, functional, clinical and therapeutic aspects.	2.377210371010091
Recent investigations indicate that HCM is considerably widespread in the population (1:500).	2.016696700785322
The causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities (mutations).	1.9526576743085322
Depending on the clinical aspect, the complaints, and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results, we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management.	2.3851644924586215
Atrial fibrillation is in 20-50% the most frequent dysrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and a possible cause for hemodynamical complications and prolongation off the medical treatment in patients.	2.3719155404734953
Therefore, the effect of -blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial.	2.350588517741648
200 patients after CABG were randomized in a drug and control group (average age 63.2 years, 154 male, 46 female).	2.1053259517801464
Patients of the drug group (n=100) were treated with metoprolol (1mg/kg/BW) beginning on day one after operation, whereas patients of the control group (n=100) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial fibrillaton.	2.4419421801529193
ECG, blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations were measured regulary until the tenth day after surgery.	2.3198918289230908
Reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction (< 30%, SA- and AV-block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol.	1.9743762518980699
There were no significant differences between the patients of drug and control group with respect to age, sex ejection fraction, previous medication, number and type of bypass grafts, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and perioperative ischemic events.	2.1986236581150047
However, a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups, 4 patients of the therapy group (4%) in contrast to 37 patients of the control (37%) developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period (p<0.0001).	2.600133830650473
Both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by 1.5 days (control group: 9.83 +/- 2.88 days; drug group: 8.42 +/- 2.81 days), which was statistically significant (p<0.05).	2.0769732770944676
All patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable sinusrhythm, whereas 7 patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation.	2.348253657169468
The difference was statistically significant as well (p<0.01).	2.199154788570346
Neither typical side effects of metoprolol, nor AV-blocks, bradycardia (f<60/min) or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed.	2.067784991546363
The conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol/day after coronary artery bypass surgery, which can reduce the incidence of SVA as well as the hospital stay statistically significant.	2.425240155271183
Especially by using the "Functional Muscular Diagnostics" described by Janda specific muscular imbalances can be found.	2.1008366840907944
The method is easy to apply and should be used during and before the championship season.	2.520482310369996
Background: Angiotensin converting  enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) alter the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldesterone-system, which regulates the angiotensin II synthesis.	2.065327059428685
Angiotensine II is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor.	3.1633957974280706
ACE-inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the WHO-guidelines.	2.803421320628018
The experiences concerning the use of ACE-inhibitors in pediatric patients are  limited.	2.724971656563321
The frequency of side-effects are not known on a sufficient scientific basis.	2.4000491963784145
Evoked potentials (EP) are a valuable tool when assessment of neurocritical care patients is impaired by loss of consciousness and lack of co-operation.	2.1982317025691107
Different modalities of short latency EP can be applied to evaluate sensory, auditory and visual systems.	2.13193041810016
Paclitaxel, a potent anti-tumor agent, shifts the cytoskeleton equilibrium towards assembly of altered and extraordinarily stable microtubules.	1.8335734373676522
These cellular modifications lead to reduced proliferation, migration, and signal transduction.	2.2026311134050043
It is highly lipophilic, which promotes a rapid cellular uptake, and has a long-lasting effect in the cell due to the structural alteration of the cytoskeleton.	2.476535636503779
This makes paclitaxel a promising candidate for local drug delivery intended to address the proliferative and migratory processes involved in restenosis.	1.8581741152048736
In this article, results of our in vitro and in vivo studies with paclitaxel are presented.	2.2024992488946284
Cell culture experiments with monocultures of human arterial smooth muscle cells as well as cocultures with human endothelial cells showed that paclitaxel leads to an almost complete growth inhibition within a dose range of 1.0-10.0µmol/l, even after a short (20 min) single dose application.	2.056259164592673
Tubulin staining and electron microscopy enabled visualization of paclitaxel-induced vessel wall alterations.	2.104758134529619
In the rabbit model, locally delivered paclitaxel resulted in reduced neointima formation and enlargement in vessel size; in the pig model, however, after stenting, this inhibition was not significant.	1.9312502447204396
Both reduced proliferation and enlargement in vessel size contribute to a preservation of vessel shape and are likely to be caused by a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton, which is also supported by vascular contraction force experiments.	2.2042068049475843
Atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases, with a still increasing incidence.	2.6820566418795755
Although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood, a variety of triggering factors are known.	2.4559605686344486
The following case report describes the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in a 2-year-old boy in whom both IgE-mediated allergic reactions and psychological factors were involved in triggering and maintenance of skin lesions.	2.1964478560356184
This demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be.	2.2725363451923926
Identity development in adolescence may act as stressor triggering juvenile psychotic episodes.	2.030283607813029
A model is being presented stating that self development in subjects with high vulnerability for psychosis leads to the establishment of an "imaginary self" consisting of phantasies and fictions without taking into account facts and social realities.	1.826952168402206
The "imaginary self" stabilizes irritating self deficiencies, thus leading to a vulnerability for depersonalisation and identity diffusion during actual turmoils of adaptation.	1.8536455964664815
Biomaterials are defined as non-living materials which are used in interaction with biological systems.	2.279570415534578
Especially in the field of urology, biomaterials are applied in urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and as cosmetic prostheses.	2.08951326302771
Biomaterial-tissue interaction is caused by the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial, its degradation, and the resulting protein denaturation.	2.7044907978695747
General requirements include biocompatibility and functionality and the avoidance of carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic, and allergic reactions.	1.9492453268095395
This ist most important when there is permanent contact between urine and epithelial tissue, which may lead to biofilminfection and incrustation.	2.3014733860529977
Continuous modification of known materials, inauguration of new materials, as well as the possibilities of tissue engineering will determine their development in the years to come.	2.300082908972616
Hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently.	2.7647037898773035
In this paper, under the premise, that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right, the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method.	1.8343398262641837
It is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient.	1.9766867068658913
First, a series of diagnostic, structural, motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed.	2.116078246711975
Second, the moments of a capacity for cohesion and aspects of social relatedness are considered as helpful tools for a formulation of an indication.	1.9221275836038882
As cohesion - according to group treatment outcome research results - has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance, in the context of group psychotherapy, the quest for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions.	2.135058203124317
The conclusion is that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, would preferably be indicated for those patients who suffer from constraints of emotional competence as stemming from developmental deficits.	1.9464508442468318
Purpose: To evaluate method- and user effects as well as the required time in the determination of left- and right ventricular ejection fractions in comparing manual and semiautomatic border detection of the endocardium.	2.2013881651641802
The diagnosis of urinary tract infection in renal transplant patients is important because unrecognized bacterial infection may lead - in the worst case - to graft loss.	1.99936571667479
Between January 1995 and January 1997, we therefore obtained bladder catheter urine samples in 31 female allograft recipients when voided urine samples repeatedly showed pyuria (>=10 WC per microscope field (x40)) and significant bacteriuria (>=;105/ml) combined with vaginal contamination (plenty of squamous epithelial cells, mixed bacterial growth).	1.6699232668889372
Results: In 55 % (17/31), diagnosis of urinary tract infection was confirmed by single bladder catheterization; in 26 % (8/31), urinary tract infection could be excluded, and in 19 % (6/31), bladder colonization without pyuria was found.	2.1716560444105686
Thus, 45 % of the patients with abnormal voided urine samples did not need antimicrobials.	2.6333168571129324
After single dose antibiotic therapy with 500 mg Ciprofloxacin, given immediately after catheterization, no infectious complications occurred.	1.9709819628021366
Diagnostic single bladder catheterization is a simple, safe and - compared to suprapubic aspiration - barely invasive method for the diagnosis or exclusion of urinary tract infection in female renal transplant patients with higher risk for complications due to an acute bladder infection and non-conclusive voided urine samples.	2.1718195095210118
Most people with the Metabolic Syndrome die from thrombotic complications superimposed to degenerative arterial vascular lesions, mostly myocardial infarction.	1.933078572097175
Type-2-Diabetes is a risk factor per se for such complications, but often clusters with dyslipoproteinemia, hypertension and obesity.	2.1364580317563733
This is referred to as "Metabolic Syndrome" and often operates on a genetically programmed susceptibility which accelerates the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in front of a much wider diabetes specific cardiopathy.	2.0772404918352656
From a pathophysiological point of view none of these associated risk factors explains the pathogenetic series of events leading to the precipitation of an occlusive thrombus at sites of complicated coronary plaques.	1.9359547453209505
In patients with the Metabolic Syndrome the coagulation system is switched towards a prethrombotic state, involving increased plasmatic coagulation, diminished fibrinolysis, decreased endothelial thromboresistance and predominantly platelet hyperreactivity ("diabetic thrombocytopathy").	1.7093659371035705
Some of these factors are associated with an increased coronary risk (e.g.	2.3023303487874025
fibrinogen, PAI-1, platelets), but are also directly linked to the pathogenesis of "atherothrombosis".	2.866274679169368
Altered cardiac remodelling together with adhesion and coagulation mechanisms appears suitable to explain decreased functional performance of infarcted organs, decreased success of acute (reduced fibrinolytic response, no reflow phenomenon) and longterm intervention strategies for vessel patency (PTCA, CABG) in Diabetes.	1.6892995912917963
Glucose adjustment alone will not adequately neutralize these complex mechanisms, but in the situation of myocardial infarction eumetabolization with parenteral glucose-insulin-potassium infusion appears mandatory similar to non-diabetics.	2.0040661409320464
On the longterm a multidimensional interventional repertoire is required particularly in patients with the Metabolic Syndrome including antihypertensive, antidyslipoproteinemic and antithrombotic drugs, customized according to the individual patients needs as assessed by early diagnostic measures ("early secondary prevention").	2.034546982493963
The indication for operative treatment in spondylolisthesis results from pain, progressive sliding and, in up to 60 % of the patients with progressive dislocation, from radicular malfunction.	2.371056167879267
The posterolateral fusion in situ is a safe procedure, but the deformation remains and in spondyloptosis plastic deformation of the fusion mass can lead to further dislocation.	2.281756544125127
With the external fixator as an instrument for reduction and the internal fixator for stabilization the reduction of even serious spondyloptosis and the recovery of a normal spine alignement and posture is possible, with an acceptable neurological risk.	2.129083134230554
Therefore a concept of treatment is suggested, which as a rule is aiming at the anatomical reduction of the dislocated vertrebra beside stabilization and nerveroot decompression.	2.070798031064824
Depending on the extent of the slip, reduction and stabilization is to be performed in one, two or three stages.	2.6585211061262557
An anterior or posterior fusion is sufficient in grade I dislocation.	2.3041793725451094
In grade II-V a combined posterior and anterior surgical proceedure is recommended.	2.101099073268661
Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate a modified technique of interskalene brachial plexus anaesthesia (ISB) and postoperative catheter analgesia for shoulder surgery.	1.9774735830595278
The original method described by Winnie bears some rare but life-threatening complications (inadvertent subarachnoid or intra-arterial injection, pneumothorax).	1.9217657659331897
Objectives: Due to its low solubility and negligible metabolism, desflurane is assumed to be especially suitable for application by low-flow anaesthetic techniques.	2.1672897056112688
The aim of this clinical investigation was the development of a standardised dosing scheme for low-flow and minimal-flow desflurane anaesthesia.	2.4323093268225104
Methods: One hundred six ASA status I-II patients were assigned to six groups according to the duration of the initial high-flow phase, fresh gas flow, and fresh-gas desflurane concentration.	2.266188609133382
The median age, height, body weight, and constitution of the groups was comparable.	2.2263465745472844
After an initial high-flow phase using 4.4 l/min, the fresh gas flow was reduced to 0.5 l/min (minimal-flow anaesthesia) or 1.0 l/min (low-flow anaesthesia).	2.29064343260463
Inspired nitrous oxide concentrations were maintained at 60% to 70%.	2.1937349767350947
Using different standardised schemes of vaporizer settings, inspired desflurane concentrations were applied in the range from 3.4% to 8.7%, i.e., between 1 and 1.5 MAC.	2.0850761498372017
Inspired and expired desflurane concentrations were measured continuously by the side-stream technique and recorded on-line.	2.1370355697530474
Venous blood samples were taken immediately prior to induction and 45 min after flow reduction for measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) concentration).	1.9272707060238055
Results: In the 10- to 15-min initial phase during which a high fresh gas flow of 4.4 l/min was used, the inspired desflurane concentration reached values in the range of 90%-95% of the fresh gas concentration.	2.160695941829749
In low-flow anaesthesia this concentration could be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting, whereas in minimal-flow anaesthesia with flow reduction the fresh gas concentration had to be increased by 1% to 2%: The quotient calculated by division of the inspired desflurane concentration by its fresh gas concentration (Q=CI/CF) ranges between 0.65 and 0.75 in minimal-flow and between 0.80 and 0.85 in low-flow anaesthesia.	2.0122764339453423
If use was made of the wide output range of the desflurane vaporizer, the inspired concentration could be increased rapidly by about 5% in 8 min, although the flow was kept constant at 0.5 l/min.	1.9685197285664657
Compared with its value prior to induction (2.13 +/- 1.05%), the COHb concentration decreased statistically significantly by about 0.7% during the 1st hour of minimal-flow anaesthesia (1.42 +/- 1.01%).	1.9010720400468013
In no case was a COHb concentration observed that exceeded threatening or even toxic values, although the soda lime was changed routinely only once a week.	1.9576424439573925
Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic properties of desflurane, resulting in especially low individual uptake, and the wide output range of the vaporizer facilitate the use of low-flow anaesthetic techniques in routine clinical practice.	2.4455900332864946
Even in minimal-flow anaesthesia, the duration of the initial high-flow phase can be shortened to min.	2.227748579507488
If the flow is reduced to 1 l/min, the inspired desflurane concentration achieved in the initial high-flow phase can be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting.	2.119176087101842
In minimal-flow anaesthesia, however, with flow reduction to 0.5 l/min, the fresh gas concentration has to be increased to a value 1%-2% higher than the inspired nominal value.	2.552521621529817
Due to the wide dialling range of the desflurane vaporizer, the amount of vapour delivered into the breathing system can be increased to about 110 ml/min even at a flow of 0.5 l/min.	2.1071847149810936
The large amount of agent that can be delivered into the system even under low-flow conditions, together with the very low individual uptake, results in a time-constant that is sufficiently short for the clinically required rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentrations.	2.126373303306525
The short time-constant of low-flow desflurane anaesthesia improves the control of the anaesthetic concentration.	2.618390620607468
If all measures are taken to safely avoid inadvertent drying out of the soda lime, there is no evidence that low-flow anaesthesia with desflurane is liable to increase the risk of accidental ca	2.4812055168080662
Arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis.	2.36602977329742
Specific complications are rarely documented in literature.	2.458763273491765
The perforation of an arterial Port-a-cath followed by duodenal fistula is an uncommon complication of regional hepatic chemotherapy.	1.9967499144658631
Besides systemic disorders caused by the chemotherapeutic agents, such as vomiting, sickness, or gastritis and duodenitis, gastroduodenal ulcers can occur as a local complication of treatment.	2.1514919285512275
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery or occlusion of the port device are the most common reasons for withdrawal of treatment in our series.	2.4944536034503604
Based on our experience and the case report of a duodenal fistula we recommend angiography of the port system prior to each cycle of chemotherapy.	2.201624723644172
Background: Coenesthesias can be defined as disorders of body perception or body hallucinations, projected in different parts of the body.	2.0665476156341964
Patients complain of intractable pain or dysesthesia.	2.2907591985878577
These symptoms are reported even from organs where we usually have no perception.	2.0524465960007223
Coenesthesia must be regarded as a symptom that can be observed in various psychiatric diseases, e.g., schizophrenia.	2.6697351817526513
However, in rare cases coenesthesias can be documented in neurological diseases, e.g., intracranial tumors or infections.	2.1578120787836106
Therefore, accurate assessment of possible differential diagnoses is important.	2.3303814566838432
In late stages, coenesthesias can easily be recognized because of their "bizarre" character.	2.1154565203276015
They frequently undergo operations because of their great suffering.	2.382453906203927
The drug treatment of first choice is neuroleptics, but the results are unpredictable.	2.7600756956251176
Question: What risks do different forms of immunosuppression (azathioprine, Cyclosporin, azathioprine/Cyclosporin plus steroids) represent in pregnancy for the mother and fetus after kidney transplantation?	1.877236475661143
Retrospective analysis of 40 pregnancies and deliveries.	2.412453652730824
Investigation of abortion -, premature birth rate, fetal retardation, malformation, hospitalization, modus of labour, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal mortality, hypertonia, preeclampsia, anemia, kidney function, rejection crisis, mechanical compression, kidney function after 1 and 5 years postpartum.	1.7407796629049612
Recommendation guideline: preconceptional time (contraception) and intensive care in pregnancy.	2.3128388312984347
The risk of pregnancy is justified if the presuppositions are correct and the woman would urgently like to have a child.	2.0281910099781415
Studies on the everyday life of the elderly often deal with visible behavior.	2.1503519992124747
In this study, the subjective experience of the everyday living environment was investigated, paying special consideration to the role of mobility impairment.	2.222107562120304
Two approaches, one oriented toward the subject's experience of the home environment, another oriented toward the environmental specifics of the individual's favorite place, were employed.	1.8906832416812882
Is the experience of living at home different for individuals with various levelsults were found in the experience of cognitive, biographical, and spatial dimensions of the living environment.	2.11675256010988
Similarities were found in the experience of emotional, social, and behavioral dimensions of one's home.	2.4670404308647518
Competence loss played an important role in how the subjects experienced living at home, yet even the mobility impaired experienced their home as a environment which could be shaped.	2.000504545057442
The environment-oriented approach showed that the favorite place of mobility impaired persons was characterized by higher spatial density.	2.1884076680542535
Finally, an examination of four home environment profiles using cluster analysis illustrated the connection between both person- and environment-oriented approaches and offered insights into a transactional perspective of person and environment.	1.757576145986605
Even though the subjective experience of one's home environment is not easily quantifiable in terms of maintaining everyday competence, it nonetheless imparts meaning to the elderly person's daily life.	1.886134493833786
The main advantage of the bilateral medial rectus faden operation (posterior fixation suture) for the treatment of essential infantile esotropia is the low occurrence of delayed consecutive exotropia.	2.0992549071262094
Nevertheless, this unwanted complication also occasionally occurs after a faden operation.	2.020834720367829
We report the rare development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma involving the minor salivary glands in the buccal mucosa of a 78-year-old female.	2.0982549853898
Tumor presented as a small asymptomatic left buccal mass.	2.2908001766948227
The initial dominant component of the neoplasm was a pleomorphic adenoma, while the minor component was a myoepithelial carcinoma.	2.267665239790804
Recurrences of tumor after 2 and then 5 years were excised.	2.2793889493623967
Histopathological examination of the last tissue removed showed a pure myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands without evidence for a pleomorphic adenoma.	2.442515947577002
The clinical features, therapy, diagnosis, histopathology and literature are reviewed.	2.2356679580915135
The purpose of this prospective study was to determine concomittant lesions of glenohumeral dislocation and their correlation with the outcome, to determine the influence of various stabilizing operation techniques on the outcome.	2.5540506292466754
106 shoulders [104 patients, 81 men, 23 women, mean age 36 (16-83) years] operated because of shoulder instability after at minimum one shoulder luxation between 1988 to 1995 were evaluated 3 years (0.8-8 years) postoperatively using Constant score.	1.8419229619719166
Preoperative arthroscopy was performed to document intraarticular lesions.	2.6171119364777615
There were 7 reluxations (5 because of a new accident), mostly after Putti-Platt procedures.	2.2047698611461555
The average modified Constant Score was 66 (10-85) points (maximum 85).	2.0734490954922222
29 patients (27%) had less than 60 points, mostly because of pain and restriction of function, and were evaluated as poor.	2.2639966682863855
Lesions of rotator cuff, long biceps tendon and subscapularis tendon had a bad prognosis.	2.0530472947006233
The severity of arthroscopically found lesions correlated with the outcome.	2.34521947797021
Operations with shortening of subscapularis tendon or using a bone graft gave bad results.	2.0550320318558195
Anatomic reconstruction of the labrum-ligament complex in combination with a plasty of the extended capsule gave best results.	2.3256501398927574
Preoperative arthroscopy can determine the extent of different lesions after shoulder luxation which influence the outcome and is useful to select the optimal operation technique.	2.184488342044389
Prenatal determination of fetal blood groups by DNA amplification today is possible for Rhesus D, eE, cC, Kell (K1/2), Duffy (Fya/b) and Kidd (Jka/b).	1.7254778176184782
Current assays using multiplex PCR and at least two specific primers as well as an intern control offer a diagnostic power of more than 99%.	2.3346738305864303
In all pregnancies complicated by irregular blood group antibodies, blood group typing in amniotic fluid allows to reduce the number of invasive procedures.	2.0718575046528667
PCR typing is recommended in all cases with a heterozygous father and an increased antibody level or suspicious findings during ultrasound evaluation.	2.2508213520083893
Adjuvant therapy with interferon for malignant melanoma causes neurotoxic side effects such as depression.	2.143579853957938
The biochemical mechanisms are unknown.	2.5187624283217267
We report two cases with both depression and amnesia.	2.169488326471133
Molecular and epidemiological studies have confirmed that human pathogenic papillomaviruses (HPV)types 16 and 18 are causally involved in the developement of carcinoma of the cervix.	2.04246037315732
This statement is also true, albeit with reservations as yet, of other so-called high-risk HPV types, such as HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56 and 58.	2.0864567177169673
Around 500,000 women throughout the world become ill with carcinoma of the cervix every year, and 1-4% of all younger women have a precancer of the cervix uteri.	2.232412189516849
This knowledge of the viral origin of anogenital neoplasms has not yet been exploited for primary and secondary prevention of these illnesses, however.	2.409764439953183
This is mainly because infection with genital HPV types is very prevalent in young women but seldom leads to carcinoma.	1.8539038246687238
In this review, therefore, the most important epidemiological data available on cervical carcinoma and its preliminary stages are analysed with reference to an association with HPV.	2.3499152765600932
In addition, the molecular biological data on HPV as it relates to anogenital carcinogenesis are presented.	1.8828745414480055
In conclusion, the significance of HPV for the prevention of carcinoma of the cervix is discussed.	2.340071544642399
We report the case of a 43-year-old woman who had a cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior myocardial infarction.	2.272235301188131
Her husband and a general practitioner living in the neighborhood initially performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation.	2.1669127559523287
A prehospital emergency physician found ventricular fibrillation when he arrived after 20 minutes.	2.018601086946545
Therefore, the patient was carried to our clinic under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.	2.5118906766177385
A cardiologist was informed with radio signal.	2.2533888560310618
Percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (pCPS) was implanted in the emergency department after 100 minutes of cardiac arrest.	2.26412847324219
After stabilizing the hemodynamic situation by pCPS (4-5 l/min) it was possible to transfer the patient to the catheterization laboratory.	2.4375100060715593
Angiography revealed proximal occlusion of a dominant right coronary artery.	2.2454980449603843
After successful angioplasty it was possible to reestablish stable sinus rhythm by single defibrillation.	2.189075582165798
By use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) the flow rate of pCPS was reduced every two hours.	1.9740000186930013
After 10 hours of support pCPS was explaned.	2.2320820138563784
IABP was needed for three days.	2.590811842834334
The patient was discharged from hospital without any relevant neurological deficits after nine weeks.	2.019443339613869
By using pCPS it is possible to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice.	2.137408833770309
The use of pCPS in resuscitation is indicated in circulatory arrest if further therapeutic options seem promising.	1.9862508453008203
Defects of the frontoorbital complex subsequent to extensive tumor surgery or severe trauma often result in aesthetic and functional disharmonies.	1.9260631004005273
The long-term results of rehabilitation related to different materials and techniques are the subject of this study.	2.7273311445875734
From 1974 to 1996 altogether 127 patients with bony defects of the orbit and/or the skull base underwent surgery.	2.545388650317836
All patients' data were documented prospectively from 1984 onwards.	2.1647140236917735
The results following reconstruction with autologous calvarian transplants in 52 patients were compared to those of a control group which received iliac bone or PMMA implants.	2.246405422066348
Eighty-one bony defects (64%) resulted from tumor resection; 37 patients (29%) suffered from the effects of trauma.	2.185287559908715
In 67 cases (53%) reconstruction was performed primarily, in 51 cases (40%) secondarily.	2.235874821907847
Free or pedicled soft-tissue transplants were necessary in order to separate the orbit and the neurocranium in 26% of the defects.	2.4224582752618784
On the other hand, small, isolated defects of the orbital roof (7%) were left without any reconstructive procedure.	2.082571071281399
Contrary to the iliac bone grafts, the calvarian transplants resisted secondary resorption.	2.1118932935810473
Postoperative infections appeared in two cases; loss of transplants was avoided entirely in the group of calvarian reconstructions in contrast to the alloplasts.	2.373703138755738
The selection of a suitable donor site area and rigid fixation with microplates led to excellent esthetic results even in cases with large defects.	2.1142775905315694
Within inpatient psychotherapy traditionally different therapeutic approaches are combined.	2.426115555216526
Usually verbal interventions of different orientations and settings (e.g.	2.0230600909851884
individual and group therapy), nonverbal procedures (e.g.	2.151948664865817
music and art therapy) and bodyoriented techniques are included.	2.338170237385704
The combinations is merely additive, integrated or eclectic.	2.112024964191535
Little is known about the reciprocal interrelation of such combinations.	2.2449044908150357
We report an 18-year old woman with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and normal intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels.	2.1993025105571165
The reason for this rare biochemical presentation are possible biologically active amino-terminal parathyroid hormone polypeptide fragments not detected by the widely used two-site immunoradiometric parathyroid hormone assay (PTH IRMA).	1.7332525479532745
Diagnosis and therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism therefore should not exclusively rest on the finding of hypercalcemia coupled with an elevated iPTH level.	2.1672681786611325
Viral hepatitis belongs to the most important infectious diseases worldwide.	2.7086951128148615
High endemic areas of viral hepatitis are Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Near, Middle and Far East.	1.8131482685142573
Viral hepatitis is also very important in health care workers.	2.4798987145599387
Today viral hepatitis can be differentiated from type A to type E (G) based on immunological and molecular assays.	2.1047855008657725
While enterally transmitted hepatitis type A and type E only induce acute and rare fulminant disease, hepatitis type B, C and D often induce chronic progressive disease including liver cirrhosis with typical complications due to the portal hypertension and with a high rate of association with the development of primary liver cancer (HCC).	2.1642525793163476
This review focusses on viral hepatitis-related surgical problems, including liver transplantation.	2.0078939266786393
Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy (HDP) are one of the most frequent causes of maternal death and perinatal mortality.	2.221236792621358
However, chronic hypertension without complications has a more favorable prognosis than preeclampsia.	2.1314132978357145
Apart from a familial predisposition, mutations of various genes may also be responsible; among these, APC resistance is of particular clinical significance.	2.126892558145045
The insufficient endovascular invasion of trophoblast in the spiral aterioles is still considered to represent the pathogenetic basis of preeclampsia.	1.9292473848969207
Increased lipid oxidation, deported membrane components of syncytiotrophoblasts, and increased invasion of fetal cells in the maternal circulation triggering immunological reactions are discussed as the causes.	2.024450751530126
The result is an endothelial imbalance between vasoconstrictory-aggregating and vasodilatatory-antiaggregating compounds.	1.8489445091532712
The results of studies on the relevance of NO synthase are controversial.	2.3136423655265475
Currently, neither reliable methods for the early detection nor certain preventative measures to avoid the disease are available.	2.2523930488106125
Intensive care monitoring and therapy are essential for pregnant women with severe HDP.	2.400058639177721
The obstetric procedure depends on the severity and dynamics of the disease as well as the state of development of the baby.	3.3557808466197416
When the pregnancy is continued defined guidelines for its termination for maternal or fetal indications must be taken into consideration.	1.8435534755056588
After delivery, the mother must be intensively monitored for at least 24 to 48 hours (postpartal eclampsia/HELLP syndrome).	1.896503368212237
The risk for recurrence of the preeclampsia is between 20 and 26 % or when it occurred in the second trimester up to 65 % while that of HELLP syndrome is between 3.5 and 24 %.	2.043059259655063
Acanthosis nigricans is a hyperkeratotic mucocutaneous eruption of heterogenous etiology which is characterized by hyperpigmentation, velvety cutaneous thickening, intensified skin markings and development of verrucous excrescences typically involving the intertriginous areas.	1.8409960474901974
Malignant acanthosis nigricans is most often associated with an abdominal adenocarcinoma frequently unresectable at the time of diagnosis.	2.493605536449608
We report on the rare association of acanthosis nigricans with a transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.	2.033440822013586
Symptomatic treatment with topical calcipotriol significantly reduced the hyperkeratotic and papillomatous skin changes.	2.074985254418287
The goal of this evaluation study is to analyze the effects of a new gerontopsychiatric institution, the gerontopsychiatric center (GC: a combination of a home-based outpatient service, a day-hospital and a consulting office for elderly with mental disorders) on the reorganization process of the treatment system from intramural toward extramural structures, as experts of the government of the FRG have been demanding for a long time.	2.0513379114697283
Based on data of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies two regional catchment areas - the city of Bielefeld (without GC, control region) and the district of Gütersloh (with GC) - are compared and analyzed, whether changes within the gerontopsychiatric system (subsystem A), the system of general medical treatment (subsystem B), or within the elderly care system (subsystem C) occurred.	1.9949463967291623
Concerning subsystem A the results are that the GC has a strong impact on the intended shift from intra- to extramural structures, without selecting patients by diagnosis nor by severity degrees of their mental disorders in extramural treatment facilities.	1.847585003557246
The home-based outpatient treatment is especially successful for elderly with a functional psychic disorder.	2.2010376810653853
These patients had the highest scores in improvement of psychiatric symptoms as well as in reduction of their self-care deficits within one year Effects of the GC on subsystem B were evident soon after its establishment, for example, by the increasing cooperation between the gerontopsychiatric health services and general hospitals in the region with GC, in which (hospitals) two fifths of all clinical gerontopsychiatric patients with a mental disorder as the main diagnosis (ICD-9) are treated.	2.136873505365601
An effect of the GC on subsystem C is possibly the fact that in its region the rate of direct transfers of patients from the clinical gerontopsychiatric department into homes for the elderly is significantly lower than in the region without GC.	2.3500012514540183
In the field of psychoneuroimmunology it has become obvious that the immune system is governed by multiple influences from the central nervous system.	2.18142030630599
One approach to verify these interactions can be seen in stress research.	2.360073424508335
While the phenomenon of stress-induced changes in immunological processes is widely accepted, more recent studies focus on possible moderators and mechanisms of these responses.	2.0283605006294563
Within this research strategy it became evident that catecholamine increases upon stress are of a major importance for the frequently observed mild leukocytosis.	1.9927461912336222
The present study was conducted to investigate whether the often observed stress-induced increases in the number of peripheral lymphocyte subsets depends on the amount of epinephrine or norepinephrine release.	2.4698543678843783
Moreover, the question was addressed whether high or low catecholamine release is related to subjective ratings on discomfort.	1.9900417059181394
Using a "public speaking paradigm" we were able to replicate previous findings of high increases in the absolute number of CD8+ and CD56+ cells in peripheral blood.	1.9772106483886358
Moreover, when dividing subjects into high and low catecholamine responders, the amount of change was significantly larger in catecholamine responders irrespective of whether norepinephrine or epinephrine was used for grouping the subjects.	1.8805552881618395
However, high and low catecholamine responders did not differ with respect to subjective ratings on discomfort.	2.3915314117760698
The data are discussed with respect to underlying mechanisms in catecholamine-induced lymphocyte migration and possible reasons for the mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of stressor efficacy.	2.0395865583750723
We report a locally recurrent retiform haemangioendothelioma (RHE) on the right great toe in a 40-year-old woman.	2.132709367697469
There was a secondary soft tissue lesion on her right lower leg.	2.1479996509496115
Histologically, primary lesion, local recurrence and the secondary soft tissue lesion (soft tissue metastasis?)	2.2378170181858366
Long, arborizing, neoplastic blood vessels were lined by CD31 and factor VIII-positive, monomorphic endothelial tumour cells; focally solid tumour areas, papillae and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature B and T lymphocytes were noted.	1.7072902377647545
The concept and the group of low-grade malignant vascular neoplasms is discussed, with special emphasis on inclusion of RHE in this category.	2.3818788465728082
HMSN is a hereditary symmetric ascending neuropathy of the peripherial nerves.	2.1110085636643774
Several cases of HMSN with motility disorders of both eyes have been reported in the literature.	2.1668058487462956
We describe a patient with HMSN type 1 and an incomplete peripherial 3rd nerve palsy of the right eye.	2.319059969793204
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of developed unilateral oculomotor disorder in a patient with HMSN.	2.0596357593703347
A 34-year-old male (190 cm/100 kg) was scheduled for surgery of the nasal septum.	2.3284012711665794
He had had uneventful anaesthesia for appendicectomy 14 years earlier: following 600 mg thiopentone, 180 mg suxamethonium and up to 2 vol.% halothane for 20 min had been used and no symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (MH) were recorded.	1.8106750092775066
Following oral premedication with 2 mg flunitrazepam at 7.00 a.m. anaesthesia was induced with a priming dose of atracurium at 8.45 a.m. followed by 0.2 mg fentanyl, 500 mg thiopentone, and 100 mg suxamethonium.	1.884148517228765
Endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily [9], and the patient was ventilated manually in a semi-closed circle system until spontaneous ventilation resumed.	2.291525920043202
Enflurane (1.5% for 5 min, 1.0% for 10 min, and 0.8% until the diagnosis of MH was suspected) was given in 33% O2/66% N2O.	2.1751492065035287
Seventy minutes after induction it was noted that the spontaneous respiratory rate and minute volume had risen continuously from 10/min and 6 l/min, respectively, to 20/min and 12 l/min.	2.1699006995799257
Attempts at deepening anaesthesia with repeated doses of fentanyl up to a total dose of 0.95 mg failed to reduce the hyperventilation.	2.2064166723615197
In spite of a high fresh gas flow of 6 l/min and assisted manual ventilation, the FIO2 started to fall from 0.34 to 0.28 at 10:20 a.m.	1.9638088745893176
The O2/N2O ratio was changed to 1 : 1, but the FIO2 remained at 0.3.	2.3430558458662225
MH was suspected, enflurane was discontinued, and an arterial blood gas analysis was done (Table 2).	2.31665527539476
When marked acidosis and hypercarbia were found, dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg was given, the operation was terminated, and the patient's trachea was extubated and he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for 24 h. Vital signs were stable (Table 3) and no further complications were observed.	2.182982252201049
The patient did not mention pain or uneasiness postoperatively.	2.1176096618557696
About 6 months later, a muscle biopsy was done according to the European MH Protocol [5] and the patient was found to be MHEh.	2.6814694387953786
In this case five main reasons for the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis must be considered (Table 1).	2.1393898143526906
Firstly, hypoventilation does not seem to be reasonable as the patient was ventilated with 8 to 12 l/min, which is within the range of 80 - 120 mg/kg - min.	2.639794003679892
Secondly, we can exclude shock and hypoperfusion because the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate (within 65 - 90 beats/min), his fingertips and skin were well perfused, his body temperature was 37  °C, and there was no sign of muscle rigidity.	2.064306335269093
Thirdly, a defect of the CO2 adsorber as well as CO2 admixture to the N2O and O2 ventilation gases can cause hypercarbia.	2.2312767859162275
We use two absorbers in sequence of which one is changed every day, and found neither a change in colour of the indicator nor an abnormally raised temperature of the absorbers [11].	1.9152326232459782
A postoperative check of the ventilator showed no defect in the O2/N2O supply and a correctly functioning anaesthesia apparatus.	1.9367039775276427
A malfunction of both CO2 absorbers resulting in intraoperative hypercarbia could not explain a postoperative mixed acidosis lasting for more than 6 h. Anaesthesias performed at the same time using soda lime from the same canisters were totally uneventful.	2.0543036467615083
It is concluded that the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis were caused by hypermetabolism.	2.1063806920922747
A thorough postoperative examination by an internist did not reveal any thyroid, pulmonary, endocrine, or circulatory reason for our intra- and postoperative findings.	2.0462618248168147
Iatrogenic factors like superficial anaesthesia or systemic side effects of adrenaline admixture to local anaesthetics can cause hypermetabolism without striking clinical signs, but they do not cause mixed acidosis lasting longer than 6 h (Table 2).	1.990966382329287
The most suitable explanation in this case is an abortive form of MH.	2.323723857866323
Introduction: Avoidance of extracorporeal circulation during beating heart surgery (OP CAB = Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery) for aortocoronary bypass grafting (ACBG) is gaining increasing importance in modern cardiac surgery.	1.760085075814017
With the development of new mechanical stabilization devices, the revascularization of the posterior wall of the heart and the distal rith coronary artery became feasable.	2.3627005329611435
Especially high-risk patients with multiple risk factors for open heart surgery will profit from this approach, because the negative effects of the extracorporeal circulation are avoided.	2.565880747167869
Although dementia is described as one of the constituent characteristics of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), alongside gait disturbances and urinary incontinence, there is a rather limited number of controlled studies concerning neuropsychological deficits in the disease.	2.2373121970842997
A wide range of psychopathologically relevant symptoms have been described, but the common features of most cases include mental and motor slowing, apathy, emotional indifference, anosognosia, memory and attentional impairment.	1.984002642841698
A number of other functional deficits such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, acalculia, apraxia can also frequently be found.	1.828568028938872
Some emphasis is put on the work of J. de Mol (Brussels) which appears to be most important for the study of neuropsychological symptoms in NPH patients.	2.1937335288749766
The methodological standard of a number of studies has been found to be rather low, and yet a sound neuropsychological investigation may be of utmost importance for the diagnosis and neurosurgical outcome assessment.	2.5835645753289977
Concerning morphological correlates of the functional deficits in NPH, various hypotheses have been formulated, but it is argued that symptoms can neither be described as predominantly "diffuse" in nature, nor can they be reduced to unilocular dysfunctions.	1.9319441102632935
Recommendations for future research strategies are formulated.	2.6351284060320697
Up to now there are no published results of therapy of paraphilia (Pedophilia, Sadism) and sexual aggressive impulsiveness with LHRH-(luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) Agonists in the Germanspeaking countries.	1.7443544739112005
In this report we describe 11 patients which were treated with the LHRH-Agonist Leuprolide Acetate in a period of 12 months.	2.3247507395554536
The patients showed no tendency of sexuell aggressive behaviour and reported an evident reduction of penile erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexual deviant impulsiveness and phantasies.	1.7064213148990441
One patient died from suicide.	2.589117430595308
In combination with other treatments LHRH-Agonist seem to be a very promising alternative to cyproterone acetate and its possible carcinogene effects.	2.2450573606328623
Aim of the study: To investigate the long-term effect of TNFR55-IgG1 in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis refractory to multiple previous DMARD treatments.	2.4879480521161232
Methods: Between 1994 and 1995 we recruited 80 patients for two double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials.	2.0761059857943236
All patients were treated for 2-30 months with a glycosylated fused protein consisting of two human p55 TNF receptors linked to a human IgG1-Fc.	1.9322526249724168
The dose range was 2.5-100mg/month given i.v.	1.9630707329898311
with cumulative doses from 40-940mg.	2.345261446851793
All patients were followed-up prospectively for 24-36 months after initiation of therapy.	2.2204748901759754
The evaluations included a 48 swollen and tender joint count, ESR, CRP, RF, ANA, ENA, and safety parameters at 6 month intervals.	1.6957257475668162
In addition, pharmacokinetics, TNF, and anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection.	2.10081296505289
Results: Data from 80 patients are available representing an experience of more than 170 patient years;  11 patients are still being treated.	2.1930836421126942
Predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol.	2.2510957939707197
Six patients died  (1 during treatment, 5 in the post-treatment follow-up).	2.6952814902968796
All deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post-surgery septic arthritis 6 months after the last dosing (during vacation in another country).	1.9398281092285672
Anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half-time.	2.3111623045132847
Shifts in the TNFR55-IgG1 glycosylation pattern affected pharmacokinetics and efficacy.	2.1564459439487513
A lupus nephritis occurred 18 months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive RA (ANA and dsDNS positive already before TNFR55-IgG1 initiation).	1.9473158771081978
Conclusion: Treatment with TNFR55-IgG1 is safe and efficacious over the long-term in patients with severe refractory RA.	2.6708529080273196
For both VFR and as IFR flight, visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot.	2.1077992027262473
The new possibilities for change of refraction by means of corneal refractive surgery have led to an increasing demand from pilots for these new methods.	2.2264380474860377
Can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes?	2.455958373917753
The valid regulations for medical standards of pilots, as well as the future international regulations such as JAR and ICAO, are explained in this respect.	2.072346767104565
A report is given on the work of the Advisory Board of the German Federal Government Air Traffic Authority and on the cases treated so far and their outcome, and recommendations are expressed.	2.173648947726295
Concerning the legal situation and clinical experience, advice for pilots, aviation medical examiners and ophthalmologists is given.	1.8770972270259862
Persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders, especially hypospadias.	2.057853293208104
Inadequate activity of the müllerian inhibiting factor, in addition to fetal testosterone deficiency, is responsible for this syndrome.	2.3756851472038467
The etiology, diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed.	2.250635023869084
A complex case of penile-scrotal hypospadia, hypoplastic prostate gland, testicular ectopia and retrovesical cyst is presented.	1.7784809355071685
The official German guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called Robert-Koch-Institut, twelve years ago.	1.8312544226935996
The recently published official "guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	1.646547633273601
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official German guidelines.	1.8326580419224672
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia.	2.2563971962175793
At present, the importation into Germany of life-threatening and highly contagious diseases such as pneumonic plague and Ebola is unlikely, but cannot be ruled out.	1.8227826430195477
In spite of the extreme rarity of these diseases, guidelines are necessary to prevent the spread of these agents in case of their importation.	2.4436358758422396
In Germany, marked regional differences exist with respect to the development of emergency regulations and the availability of specialized centers for diagnostics and therapy.	2.415918511897801
A federal framework is missing.	2.4646906339183574
A concept is presented here in which the capacity to respond is substantially augmented with limited additional cost through inter-regional cooperation using existing infrastructure and federally standardized procedures.	1.8300035175893437
The therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than 30 years.	2.2585183522600114
A total of 83 patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as ingle-centre, long-term open (12 months) clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid ester preparations Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm.	2.1823393125598676
The antipsoriatic effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear, with a mean reduction of 76% in PASI.	2.498456753616991
Adverse events in were noted in 62% of the patients (mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints).	2.4790049622520094
These were dose-dependent and decreased in frequency in the course of the study.	2.959812988217256
No severe adverse events occurred.	2.4878218019166156
We believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy-resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long-term application.	2.6330827199512825
Background: Because retinal necrosis syndrome seldom occurs, we present our results of silicone oil tamponade for associated retinal detachment.	1.9815576419826422
The eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions.	2.490198284959286
Swelling - often oedematous - is a frequent symptom.	2.452149799585082
This publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short characterisations of possible causes.	2.0506250615764303
The subjective complaints of the patient charts (pain, pruritus) are shown to be important criteria for orientation.	2.6945698723776754
Special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling.	2.01188596347173
A 74-year-old man suffered from symptoms of a left upper lobe pneumonia.	2.520114127885427
Additional retrosternal masses were proved.	2.501054698013855
Progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy; infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen.	2.7012250526346655
No germs could be identified.	2.6698592676623707
Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy showed no pathological findings.	2.3698410480749668
His general health became worse, and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of "wandering pneumonia" with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism.	2.372065265115504
Autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland.	2.002643878618188
General manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow.	2.1077667371466977
The unusual constellation of clinical findings similar to colliquating pneumonia results in secondary infection due to tumorous pulmonary infarction.	1.9039688457767645
The difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms.	2.243048541099993
Therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of CT, MR, and angiography is very important.	2.4772546891654517
Definition of the problem: Is it the brain that makes a human being a person?	2.1070617663067943
This anthropological question has been raised because of the findings of modern human brain research, and there are severe ethical consequences anew: If the appropriate anthropological answer is yes, then all invasive research would be problematic, because one would touch the basis of human essence.	2.0038478048444333
The problem is that the two major philosophical paradigms that offer an answer to the anthropological question, dualism and monism, have opposing concepts.	1.844556421511244
Arguments: This paper argues that the error of these two paradigms is that they understand the human body and the human mind as 'res' - as things.	2.052403555168982
The explanation of the human being as an interactive unit of body and mind is impossible in both paradigms.	2.19586993460201
A third anthropological view that tries to make that understandable is the anthropology of the Hebrew Bible.	1.8514386015773907
It does assume the category 'thing' while speaking about humans, it presumes the category 'aspect'.	1.793781130341376
There is no Hebrew word for 'mind' in contrast to 'body' or vice versa.	1.9183860923379745
The biblical language only knows terms for the unity of human beings seen under a certain aspect.	1.9526456146085838
Conclusion: Here, the body and thus the brain are important and necessary condition for human essence, but this is not a sufficient explanation for the human personality.	2.3264501222768494
Invasive research on the human brain is here neither generally forbidden nor tolerated - one has to demonstrate in every single case whether the planned operation touches regions that are crucial for the personality of the human subject.	1.9774537083976558
Introduction: In recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement: hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation.	2.0124998338125364
While the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell counting, the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately.	2.23116334688169
In the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation.	2.1317785272175644
A 50 year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical infraclavicular blockade of the plexus brachialis (VIP).	2.1326521571740438
Postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia, which resolved completely after treatment.	1.9499979475171723
The blockade of the plexus was performed correctly, failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded.	2.0301244570004826
Therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the VIP, which might occur despite correct technique, and requires that the patient be informed of this eventuality.	2.219885972871463
Nevertheless, the VIP is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet.	2.2183263313463684
The risk of a pneumothorax is about 0.2 to 0.7%.	2.3497131284769863
The routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine.	2.2668290271572866
New trends in perinatal medicine, aiming at more individual and self-determined pregnancy and delivery, are realizable because of the safety provided by ultrasound.	2.1119047773288226
Often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations, but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy: early detection of fetal viability; intrauterine localization of the pregnancy; exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy; later in pregnancy, confirmation of appropriate fetal growth, position and localization of placenta site.	1.9020137255821057
In addition, the development of close mother-child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact.	2.1382090536577674
These aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child.	2.102670556969336
For routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children, sonography, voiding cystogram, IV pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available.	2.0378586414743616
Furthermore, often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed.	2.119236322595522
However, the significance of retrograde ureteropyelography in the world literature remains controversial.	2.178830325598226
Therefore, we reviewed the records of 41 children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department.	2.0926892581382974
In 9 children the ureter was visualized by IV pyelogram, voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography; a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in 21 children before pyeloplasty in the OR.	2.0759960791970866
In 11 children the ureter was not visualized preoperatively.	2.2107700399722
Retrograde ureterography neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique.	2.138591958240338
In the children where the ureter was not visualized preoperatively, no ureteric abnormality was found in association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction.	2.17114877760713
Hence, we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary, provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation.	2.14990911370715
We report on a patient with multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma, whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis.	1.9405081465202443
Spontaneous remission of the tumour, which has now been maintained for over 2 years, the change from the primary monomorphological fibrocytic appearance to a polymorphological histiocytic picture with multiple fat-storing giant cells, and the lacking demonstration of specific cell organelles finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed.	2.1879299433020485
In children with horseshoe kidneys Wilms' tumors can be observed 2 to 8-times more often.	2.12314751232746
Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue.	1.9982249895216686
We report about a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms' tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications.	1.9374266973883587
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross-section imagings.	2.1610739559023373
Both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms'tumor.	2.4790947296913113
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technic based on the idea of biological tissue healing.	2.676126585251881
External gene segments are transferred to cells that overexpress growth factors locally to achieve this effect.	2.0227692470691876
The influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature.	2.2340772036521024
Experimental data demonstrate that defect healing in bone can be accelerated by the application of different cytokines in vivo.	2.248192139331299
Gene transfer is a promising, new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade.	2.145222943226023
Biomechanical investigations of the mandible are difficult to perform due to a variety of conditions involved.	3.016812001516988
For the appropriate reconstruction of biomechanical properties, a geometrically correct body model has to be established which fits to complex in vivo conditions.	2.0974550272981816
The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of finite-element models (FEM) for the assessment of mandibular deformation under mechanical loading.	2.2055972826682035
Explanted human mandibles (n = 5) were investigated by strain gauges to determine the individual strain distribution under mechanical loading.	2.3332589905832513
FEM analysis based on a computed tomograph (CT) was performed and the results were matched with the test data.	2.7316553474985263
Our study demonstrates only minor interindividual differences in the strain distribution for each load studied.	2.1408527377243356
The mechanical response in terms of deformation was found to depend mainly on gross geometrical properties and to a minor extent on the various other variables.	2.233436636419199
At all positions the maximum principal strain was tensile, the minimum principal strain was compressive, and the absolute strain values were correlated with the magnitude of the applied force.	2.1879402609595635
CT-based FEM analysis revealed the utility of mathematical models to approximate simulated data our experimental results.	1.895758138515033
Hence, FEM analysis is a non-invasive tool in the prediction of biomechanical behaviour of individual mandibles and therefore may help in trauma reconstruction and treatment planning.	2.288684693968441
Acrodysostosis is a rare syndrome characterized by growth retardation and peripheral dysostosis.	2.560590988211221
70% of affected patients exhibit mental retardation.	2.529978415955368
Inheritance occurs in an autosomal-dominant pattern.	2.675359607598656
The genetic defect is not known.	2.663017115652435
Therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are based on the high number of non-resectable cancers, the high relative radioresistance and the high distant metastases rate.	2.8086667962253817
Even in curatively resected carcinomas, a locally effective treatment modality is needed because of the risk of microscopical residual disease in the peripancreatic tissue.	2.264233533427048
The efficacy of radiotherapy is dose dependent.	2.3300531396413557
Based on an analysis of published data a dose of more than 50 Gy is recommended, resulting in a high morbidity rate with external beam radiotherapy alone.	2.6070775197940828
The use of intraoperative radiotherapy allows locally restricted dose escalation without increased perioperative morbidity.	1.9783724145290633
In adjuvant and in primary treatment, local tumor contol was improved (70-90 %).	2.1077045468724496
With palliative intent, pain relief was obtained rapidly in over 60 % of patients and led to improved patient performance.	2.244753296533493
As a result of the high distant metastases rate, even in curatively resected carcinomas, the overall prognosis could not be significantly improved.	2.447498770945177
Further dose escalation is limited by the increasing incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (20-30 %).	2.379414716210954
Malignant tumors of the head and neck region are amongst the six most often occurring tumors of the body.	2.581295287760879
They can be associated with the different anatomical compartments as well as different histologic types.	3.0087712470582617
The way of tumor spread of these malignancies depends on their histologic type and on the region.	2.348581806778796
These compartments can be separated into the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the hypopharynx.	2.5128213496491916
Most of the malignant tumors belong to the squamous cell carcinomas, other histologic types are depicted less frequently.	2.1555291983026397
The histologic types of the other groups which are seen more often comprise of lymphomas and adenoidcystic carcinomas.	2.1069304009814926
The undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx is supposed to be a special type of tumor.	2.8783474269910765
The malignant tumors of the pharynx can also involve all three compartments.	2.487804029813695
Beside these tumors, malignancies of mesenchymal origin can also be delineated.	2.3784570968849668
While there are quite a number of reports on vascular injuries complicating hip arthropasty by acetabular component screw fixation, retractor tip pressure or extruding bone cement, the incidence of deep femoral vessel injuries in operative fixation of proximal femoral fractures is comparatively seldom described.	1.8877626245482717
We report on two patients with per- and subtrochanteric femoral fractures who sustained injuries of deep femoral artery branches during the implantation of a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and a dynamic condylar screw (DCS), which resulted in a massive thigh hematoma and a fist-size pseudoaneurysm respectively and necessitated surgical intervention in either case.	1.9612089008098248
We blame these vascular injuries on the pressure of Hohmann retractors exposing the femoral bone or on the drilling of boreholes for plate attachement.	1.8458416847895562
After discussing various operative procedures, we conclude that intramedullar implants are safer than plates with regard to potential vascular complications.	2.1519797287345885
The meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, and the subsequent radioactive fallout did not cause any acute radiation sickness in Germany.	2.0492203487243286
In our study we analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of CLP newborns in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR).	2.0129709357081675
In contrast to the Federal Republic of Germany an ongoing malformation register for CLP newborns had existed in the former GDR since 4 July 1967.	1.8304142430621893
Environmental data were collected from national and international environmental authorities and atomic energy agencies.	2.222707701239143
Population statistics were taken from the statistical yearbook of the former GDR.	2.32116226088913
During a 10-year period from 1980 to 1989, the average number of CLP newborns in the GDR was 1.88 per 1,000 live births.	2.1481111038228757
A significant prevalence increase was recorded in 1983, 1987 und 1988.	2.0661702114115346
In comparison to the mean rate in the period from 1980 until 1986, 1987 demonstrated an increase of 9.4%.	2.351464300695666
Regional prevalence increases were seen in the three northern districts of Schwerin, Rostock and Neubrandenburg, where the radioactivity measurements in general showed higher levels of the radionuclides caesium-137 und strontium-90 than in other districts.	1.9288812034847809
Owing to the comprehensive malformation register for CLP patients in the GDR, this is the first study for Germany, analyzing the CLP rate before and after the fallout in Chernobyl.	2.157853415235376
The results support the allegation of the influence of radiation-induced increase of CLP newborns after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	2.220505002028839
The median survival time for patients with disseminated malignant melanoma is 5-7 months; it is still not really known whether therapeutic measures prolong survival.	2.241555439585541
The aim of the present investigation was to identify patients with prolonged survival in stage IV disease and to analyse the possible impact of therapy on the course of the disease.	2.1897648695988647
in the Department of Dermatology, Benjamin Franklin University Medical Centre at the Free University of Berlin, 263 patients with were diagnosed as having stage IV melanoma and enrolled in a computer-based registry between 1970 and 1993.	1.81408215023733
In 89 cases systemic medical mentous treatment was given and 111 patients underwent surgery and/or radiation therapy.	2.3063932929004163
There were 48 patients who received both systemic and local therapy.	2.4843101783561257
On the other hand, 111 patients received no treatment.	2.0945334068488504
Twenty two patients were identified survived longer than 24 months (median survival time 33 months).	2.4145019585504506
None of the patients who had received no treatment survived for 2 years or longer.	2.6518178234301995
The 22 patients with prolonged survival were treated by multimodality included 16 who had received both systemic treatment and surgery and/or radiation, while 3 had had only systemic drug therapy and another 3, only local treatment.	2.1676408536505014
Twelve of the 22 patients became tumour free after their initial surgery or radiation.	2.0421400958099523
Active therapy in disseminated melanoma with reduction of tumour mass by surgery and radiation and with systemic medical treatment may lead to prolonged survival in a considerable percentage of patients.	2.1718327687921413
Background: The use of intravenous heparin is essential for the treatment of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction.	2.9682967197948265
A significant rebound of thrombin generation within 6 to 10 hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported.	2.0307156724707913
This time window is clinically critical as the incidence of recurrent ischemia peaks in this period.	2.3085371705349136
It has therefore been recommended to gradually taper heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly.	1.9385252987437904
However, it is not known which dosing procedure is useful and whether it definitly reduces thrombin rebound.	2.321536064756763
The use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human integument is discussed with reference to the literature.	2.2568672904714475
The epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural, functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers.	2.1456971192839385
The actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed.	2.1197272032684196
Practical difficulties are emphasized: in particular, the conditions required for use of porcine skin in experimental research, the most suitable breeds, and restrictions on biological interpretation of the results.	2.1737967509402507
Laparoscopic procedures have attained increasing importance in the diagnosis and therapy of carcinoma of the cervix in recent years (Table 1) [34].	2.8320308914588406
Laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortal lymphadenectomies are therefore performed to assess the operability of carcinoma of the cervix and for its staging.	2.203829966697004
In the case of primarily operable tumours, paraortal and pelvic lymphadenectomy is carried out by a laparoscopic procedure, and when the lymph nodes are negative nodes and there is no intra-abdominal metastasis the lymphadenectomy is combined with laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy.	2.0930508949986626
If laparoscopy discloses positive lymph nodes, debulking can be carried out and the patient can be referred for radiotherapy.	2.442813078048304
In addition, laparoscopic procedures, even in combination with radical cervicectomy for early invasive carcinoma of the cervix, can mean conservation of the patient's fertility.	2.366801446573616
In the case of primarily inoperable tumours laparoscopy can be used to assess the lymph node status and the intra-abdominal tumour spread and to classify the patient's condition as potentially secondarily operable or inoperable.	2.24842537813998
In addition, in the case of primarily undertreated patients whose carcinoma of the cervix has been diagnosed incidentally in preparations of tissue examined following hysterectomy, posttreatment in the form of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopically assisted colpectomy can be performed.	2.038786679578565
The efficacy of buprenorphine in opioid dependent patients (n=20) was compared to methadone maintained subjects (n=20) in a randomized comparison trial.	2.329545476708139
Sublingual application of buprenorphine as an alternative synthetical opioid is being compared to methadone during a 24 week study period.	2.092335510660213
A trend (p=0.06) could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of 63 mg oral applicable methadone (racemat of L- and D-methadone) in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7,3 mg buprenorphine (sublingual tablets).	1.9523243552342615
The dropout-rate of 11 subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout-rate of 5 in the methadone group.	2.4459454705349177
The result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid (p=0,04).	2.27235863895202
Nevertheless, efficacy of buprenorphine in maintenance could be demonstrated in the remaining subjects, and further studies with higher daily doses and a higher number of subjects have to be performed.	2.3747007397449424
In patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, surgery is a technically difficult procedure.	2.094279498627986
Whereas those rare forms of localized pleural mesotheliomy are being detected incidentally and can be cured by complete resection, most patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma present with an advanced stage of disease.	2.0730167058443634
Most of these patients survive less than 12 months irrespective of the treatment modality.	2.717055493175937
In IMIG stages I and II, extended pleuropneumonectomy followed by chemo- and/or radiotherapy is recommended.	2.4869193791452187
For this subset of patients, a median survival time of between 20 and 30 months is reported.	2.481856154832151
Pleurectomy and decortication are recommended as palliative surgical strategies against pleural effusion.	2.1361968996098253
In patients with technically inoperable infiltration of the thoracic wall, irradiation is helpful; sometimes partial remission and relief of pain can be achieved by chemotherapy.	2.1393437888646996
Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) registers the magnetic field generated by the fetal heart.	2.0148586436685565
In contrast to the fetal elctrocardiogram, fECG permits non-invasive registration of fetal heart activity and documentation of all parts of the PQRST-wave-forms from the second trimenon onwards.	2.030617409003217
This facilitates the determination of cardiac time intervals and establishment of reference values for different stages of pregnancy.	2.269227058862366
We examined 53 women in 104 recordings from the 10th week of gestation onwards (1 to 10 recordings per individual).	1.9032094142862903
The fMCG (37 magnetic channels, sampling rate 1024 Hz, bandwidth 1-200Hz) was recorded non-invasively over the mother's abdomen in a magnetically shielded room.	1.698496781475923
Registration of fetal heart beats was generally successful from the 20/21th week of gestation onwards.	2.141005179724004
In a few cases, fetal heart beats could be registered as early as in the 16th week.	2.2789676888927306
Cardiac time intervals and amplitudes of fMCG increased concordantly with fetal growth.	2.044538583285458
Mean P wave duration increased from 31 to 49 ms (p < 0.05), PQ interval from 95 to 107 ms (n. s.) and QRS duration from 36 to 52 ms (p < 0.01).	1.8554830480808744
The mean amplitudes of the P and R waves also increased.	2.116500326812172
To demonstrate imaging findings in inflammatory diseases of the pharynx and possible complications.	2.4908338056012593
The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint.	2.4337709654605892
In all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in 111 patients (79,3%) we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results.	2.1517999999412996
All in all we have found complications in 14 patients.	2.2837654794677515
In 4 cases we have seen a delayed wound healing, in 2 cases a superficial infection, in 3 cases a deep infection, in 3 cases a neural damage and in 2 cases a phlebothrombosis.	2.1334080794960992
Our study show, that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy, exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the portals.	2.243955897689677
The use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate.	2.424410155563189
Airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise.	2.8007236295460167
This very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 dB sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries.	1.911033243077576
We report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation.	2.1606468017712865
The 24-year-old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000- to 6000-Hz range and in the deep-frequency.	2.243858915868583
The possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic.	2.0149646930808425
The incidence of primary malignant neoplasms of the pleura, the pericardium and the peritoneum in Germany has been rising since about the mid-1980 s. A continuing rise is expected until about 2020, predominantly due to the peak of asbestos processing in Germany between 1965 and 1980.	1.8184416491831314
About 90 % of the mesotheliomas stored in the files of the German Mesothelioma Registry in Bochum are asbestos related and therefore possibly due to occupational exposure that may be compensated by the professional associations.	2.0253815818830616
More than 500 mesotheliomas annually can be diagnosed in the German Mesothelioma Registry.	2.551237877226763
In this first part of the series on mesotheliomas, current concepts on etiology and pathogenesis as well as diagnostic procedures and standards are discussed.	2.580170750353082
At the present, specific chromosomal or genetic defects that constantly give rise to a mesothelioma are not known.	2.0238056004854843
The initiation and progression of malignant mesotheliomas is a highly complex mechanism that is based on individual genetic alterations.	2.2429297329305276
A reliable diagnosis is the basis for therapeutic, prognostic and medicolegal conseques; in general, it can be achieved by thoracoscopic inspection with selected biopsy.	2.3117085000449493
Surgery may gain a more important role in the therapy of malignant tumors of serosal membranes not only in palliative, but also in potential curative approaches if the diagnosis can be made at earlier tumor stages.	2.387417600174578
Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10%.	2.710564964105793
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs more frequent (85%) and more severe compared to lower gastrointestinal bleeding.	2.11391606653869
The medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source.	2.9777578683647867
Prognosis and mortality are dependent on intensity of bleeding, reflected by clinical signs such as shock, hemoglobin level, transfused blood units, hematemesis, presence of comorbidity and age of the patient.	2.025140284778221
Furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality.	2.8951727995172587
Therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding.	2.647240988041111
Joints are innervated by nociceptive nerve fibres (nociceptors), which are only activated by tissue-damaging stimuli.	2.1836796783113277
This activation causes pain in conscious humans.	2.3006707803743387
The sensory terminals of many nociceptors in the tissue are sensitized by inflammatory processes.	2.088121758926787
Under these conditions, normally innocuous and non-painful stimuli are sufficient to activate nociceptors and to elicit pain.	1.9858635385661818
The effect of inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and prostaglandins is important for the process of sensitization.	2.246544719113751
In addition to their sensory function, many nociceptors have an efferent function.	2.0805546680077454
They evoke a neurogenic inflammation by the release of neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide into the tissue.	1.9033887392329072
The efferent function of nociceptors contributes to the generation of inflammatory lesions of the tissue.	2.4562941024322287
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone (AAA bone) is prepared from cortical bones of human organ donors.	1.8354816587082203
AAA bone possesses osteoinductive properties as it delivers BMPs from its bone matrix.	2.0288861537061984
Within a prospective study, 37 cranial defects were reconstructed using AAA bone implants over a period of more than 7 years.	2.4736772437897687
The patients were followed-up at standardized intervals.	2.3867084988394875
Roentgenographic assessments and bone scintigraphies revealed osseous integration and remodelling of the AAA bone implants.	2.082495233533113
In one quarter of the cases re-entry was performed 10 to 18 months after the cranioplasty (removal of osteosynthesis material, recurrence of tumor).	2.1571143421763774
All nine AAA bone reconstructions showed bleeding surfaces and bony integrations.	2.0505172093029946
A bone biopsy was taken from the center of one of these AAA bone implants and this showed new bone formation originating from the surface of the implant.	2.339853489979095
In one case an AAA bone implant was lost due to infection.	2.027157073177886
This is noteworthy as in approximately one third of the cases the bone implants were in direct contact with the frontal sinus.	2.460168304216823
The clinical results clearly emphasize the therapeutical benefit of AAA bone for cranioplasties.	2.009030316458143
Large AAA bone chips from human skull bones facilitate the reconstruction of the skull's convexity, especially when sterolithography-based operation planning is performed.	1.9857191051724894
Saphenous vein harvesting remains a 20 % source of morbidity in patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting.	2.1702502770399055
In an attempt to reduce the complications associated with this procedure, minimally invasive video-assisted vein harvesting is propagated.	2.3910025626528113
The technique uses currently available endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the great saphenous vein with two limited incisions.	1.840340273192361
The dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches by clips.	1.9136297647522793
The vein is removed for reverse arterial bypass grafting or dissection is completed for an in situ bypass procedure.	2.0302095024544276
Initial experience with ten patients undergoing peripheral bypass procedures showed a mean vein-preparation time of 60 min.	1.9758516826164916
Two of seven in situ bypass procedures were complicated by side branch damage controlled through longer skin incision.	1.9144691692733158
After a mean follow-up of 12 months, all bypasses are patent.	2.669209948870813
Obstructions of the nasolacrimal duct occur frequently (70%) in term newborns and are symptomatic in 6%.	2.001706114033413
The reason is an incomplete canalization and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period.	2.2541220085497033
A persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of Hasner in combination with a proximal valvelike obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation.	1.9706832371457168
We describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress.	2.074549769945158
The recognition of a medical discipline on a European level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the European Union.	2.0250286268954865
With supreme effort, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the EU reached this goal in 1989.	2.1312896372859247
The UEMS - Section of Stomatology and Oromaxillofacial Surgery - became the forum for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and officials of the European Commission.	1.855740388064918
Thanks to its activities, oral and maxillofacial surgery is now recognized as an independent specialty with about 3800 specialists in 11 European countries.	1.961385179258034
A biatrial pacemaker was inserted in a 68-year-old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs based on a sick-sinus-syndrome and concomitant interatrial conduction delay.	2.0590882838922733
One electrode positioned in the right atrium and another electrode located in the coronary sinus were connected to a dual-chamber pacemaker.	2.304809385292877
The electrode in the right atrium was connected to the atrial channel, the electrode in the coronary sinus to the ventricular channel.	2.3484240588949254
The pacemaker was programmed in DDD-mode with an AV-delay of 30 ms.	2.1379185136951095
Under a chronic antiarrhythmic medication with 160 mg sotalol per day there was no evidence for recurrent episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias in the patient's history, 24-h-Holter-ECG, nor in the memory of the pacemaker during a follow-up of 8 months.	2.190308731717778
The AB0 blood types, first discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped with the PCR method of Lee and Chang [6].	1.8515104069465718
Using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after digestion with restriction endonucleases, visualized by silver staining on a polyacrylamide gel.	1.6994471155608915
With the method of Lee and Chang [6] only the nucleotide positions 261 and 703 are considered so that out of 280 individuals 10 (3.57%) showed differences between the AB0 genotype and phenotype, because it was not possible to differentiate between A and 02 alleles.	1.9100370767315207
Based on the one experience and the information that is available in the literature indications for ankle arthroscopy are given, surgical equipment, patient placement and surgical technique of different procedures are described.	2.240914410330926
Finally the results and possible complications are presented.	2.6638678657681085
Removal of loose bodies as well as synovectomies in case of an acute infection or rheumatoid arthritis are good indication.	2.707074687542992
Arthroscopic treatment of anterior pathology in the athletic ankle need a thorough diagnostic work-up; the results of the treatment do not always meet the expectations of this especially demanding population.	2.2754257363801655
Cartilage treatment is technically possible, however, long term results are still missing.	2.870838553766249
This is also true for the treatment on osteochondritis dissecans.	2.767820341339428
In patients with degenerative joint disease arthroscopic debridement can only lead to a temporary benefit.	2.2734008541043136
Arthroscopic assisted arthrodeses (AAA) is technically demanding, but can serve as an excellent alternative to conventional open techniques.	2.2780504319761614
The complication rate in ankle arthroscopy is high compared to other joints, which is especially true for neurologic complications and postoperative infections.	2.222463178911785
This should be addressed when performing the informed consent.	2.125138027694372
Recent prospective randomised trials dealed with the optimal extent of surgical resection as well as with preoperative therapy modalities in pancreatic, rectal and breast cancer.	2.128400294095266
Total mesorectal excision remarkably changed surgery for rectal cancer.	2.2030722489880685
Rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer could be significantly reduced by preoperative irradiation.	2.3698902129476576
In advanced rectal cancers curative resection and sphincter preservation seems possible due to multimodal preoperative therapy.	1.8816089794161774
It has been demonstrated that in appropriate cases breastpreserving resection is comparable to mastectomy with respect to overall survival.	2.3416128492302035
Up to now it is not quite clear if sentinel node sampling is equivalent to routine lymphadenectomy.	2.0713638286006915
Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy breastpreservation rate is significantly higher, but survival is not significantly increased.	2.178069138292904
Introduction and Methods: A 0.5 T open-configuration MR system allows free access to the patient via a 58-cm-wide opening on both sides of the machine.	2.0297943796776017
A newly developed system for needle guidance enables the examiner to perform biopsies in combination with real-time imaging and to position laser fibers in the human body.	2.1119485596069554
For imaging, a 2D gradient echo sequence is used (TR 19 ms, TE 9 ms, flip angle 30  °, FOV 24 x 24 cm, slice thickness 10 mm matrix 256 x 128).	1.6598165035543522
The acquired images are displayed on two LCD screens localized within the MR system, thus allowing an interactive needle guidance.	1.9140329290784264
This procedure is illustrated by a case report.	2.6023891255349336
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are established drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure and hypertension.	2.509629842112464
There is mounting evidence to suggest that ACE inhibitors may be used for different indications as well.	2.304574803011866
The rational for the use of ACE inhibitors is to block the vasoconstrictive effects mediated by angiotensin II.	2.268897434852413
The hemodynamic profile of ACE inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the degredation of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide (NO).	1.8384864194098374
Thus ACE inhibitors may be successful in preventing the negative effects of vasoconstriction on regional circulation.	2.1130069552201354
Since vasoconstriction, particularly of the mesenteric vasculature appears to be largely mediated by the renin-angiotensin-axis, ACE inhibitors are assumed to be effective in treating or avoiding gut mucosal hypoperfusion.	1.9819361994942344
The critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is still a major therapeutic challenge.	2.2902356344157493
Intravenous preparations of ACE inhibitors may broaden our therapeutic armamentarium for these patients.	2.2595142206847902
However, several questions about the exact mechanisms of ACE inhibitors, such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose, are still open.	2.407701647865683
Moreover, further work needs to be done to definitely determine whether ACE inhibitors may be helpful to prevent or treat (micro-) circulatory catastrophe in these patients.	2.0126774688098066
The pharmacologic properties of ACE inhibitors provide an exciting stepping stone for future research in this field.	2.175770249809254
Hypoparathyroidism (HP) results from deficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, pseudohypoparathyreoidism (PHP) results form decreased PTH action on its target organs.	1.7231846124880528
Between May 1996 and 1999, a total of 186 endoscopic spinal operations were performed to treat unstable injuries and pathologic fractures.	2.2345299561496375
The operative spinal interventions followed the classic sequence of excision of part of a vertebral body, partial replacement of the vertebral body with bone harvested from the iliac crest, and implantation of a titanium plate to stabilize the part to be fused.	2.052420195885214
In 62% of these cases we performed primary dorsal straightening with a fixateur interne.	2.2367424167325427
The serious complications were aortic leakage and deep infection in the area of the graft and the implant, each of which occurred in 1 case.	2.368784043504541
Comparisons with the literature showed approximately the same rate of spinal complications as with open surgery, while the rate of morbidity connected with the surgical approach was reduced to a third in the patient population treated endoscopically, with correspondingly positive implications for the postoperative analgesic requirement and for convalescence.	2.257743582666926
Various risk scores have been developed for the assessment of operative risk in cardiac surgery.	2.7597724985384864
Although risk stratification has been acknowledged as a useful tool to analyze trends in therapy and changes in patient populations, its relevance in assessing the indication for surgery has been questioned.	2.2279975830652745
It was the goal of this prospective study to compare 6 common risk scores with regard to the predictive value for mortality in individual patients.	2.35207633098
Between September 1998 and February 1999 all adult patients undergoing heart surgery were prospectively scored according to the following scores: initial Parsonnet, Cleveland Clinic, French, Euro, Pons, and the Ontario Province Risk score.	2.0204332885549143
Early lethality was assessed within 30 days postoperatively.	2.314340975444999
Follow-up was completed in 504 patients.	2.3120717267214013
With the exception of the Ontario Province Risk score, lethality in the high risk group was overestimated by all scores, whereas lethality in low to moderate risk groups was underestimated by several scores.	1.8540727945581728
Mean scores of surviving and deceased patients showed a broad overlap with high standard deviations.	2.2045797117429653
Preoperative risk scores are effective tools for stratification of patient populations and the analysis of surgical outcome.	2.2617345368994166
With the aid of risk scores, operative risk can be sufficiently predicted for patient populations or subpopulations.	2.1716776008064413
The Euro score best predicted the outcome of our patients.	2.7017646805874462
However, when the indication for surgery is to be determined in an individual patient, risk scores should be only considered as an orientation in the decision process.	2.4582328504243613
Background and objective: A complicated course of erysipelas is not uncommon.	2.101179570888447
Bullous, haemorrhagic, necrotic and purulent lesions may be encountered.	2.0665824928682888
Today no reliable data exist as to which constitutional factors renders a patient at risk for developing complicated erysipelas though several risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, are often suggested.	2.0345124045148086
Based on the analysis of patients with erysipelas at the Department of Dermatology in Graz, factors determining the risk for complicated erysipelas should be identified.	2.4194269140007516
Patients/Methods: In a retrospective case-control study clinical data sheets of 766 in- patients treated at the department were evaluated with respect to the course of the erysipelas and with respect to potential risk factors.	2.508230308789242
Results: General risk factors for local complications were location at the lower extremities, pre-existing hepatic or renal disease, hyperuricaemia, and diabetes mellitus.	2.2782385998436077
Hepatic and renal disease and - to a lesser extent - diabetes particularly predisposed for bullous and haemorrhagic lesions, while vascular occlusive disease enhanced the risk for ne- crotic lesions.	1.861546078675245
Conclusions: Location and hepatic and renal disease are the most important risk factors, while diabetes is probably of less significance than previously suggested.	2.447140814391376
Patients with end-stage liver disease frequently develop combined coagulopathies due to increased procoagulant and fibrinolytic turnover as well as thrombocytopenia.	2.2358831121705895
This substitution commonly follows standard rules based on the assumption that 0.5 - 1 IU of a coagulation factor or inhibitor concentrate given per kg body weight will increase its endogenous activity by 1%.	1.982563410426111
We set out to investigate the validity of this standard regime in patients with end-stage liver disease scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation.	2.563721255424997
Fifty-one adult patients were prospectively studied.	2.458469131642088
In 37 patients with antithrombin III (AT III) activity <70%, an AT III preparation (Kybernin, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was given preoperatively (mean dose 2616 +/- 207 IU) following standard calculations in order to increase endogenous activity to 80%.	1.8488149746367106
Twenty-seven of the patients had chronic hepatic failure (CHF group) with histologically proven cirrhosis and 10 had acute hepatic failure (AHF group).	2.1627980945416416
Blood samples were drawn prior to a 15-min infusion of AT III concentrate and 30 min thereafter.	2.0993875829126156
In 14 patients with prothrombin time (PT) <40%, AT III levels had been corrected earlier during the clinical course to achieve activities >70%.	1.9402159547639994
Prothrombin complex (PPSB, Beriplex, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was substituted (mean dose 2304 +/- 289 IU) to increase procoagulant activity to PT >60%.	1.7378020820678612
Blood samples were drawn in the same fashion as in the AT III group.	2.447249999240895
The amounts of AT III and PPSB concentrates ( AT III, [IU/kg];  PPSB [IU/kg]) required to increase AT III activity and PT, respectively, by 1% were calculated.	2.1251811784579657
Standard calculations for AT III substitution indicated AT III recovery in all 37 patients who received AT III concentrate.	2.023200427606693
However, there was a statistically significant difference between patients with CLF and ALF.	2.593620850086667
In patients treated with PPSB concentrate,  PPSB was 1.6 U/kg ( +/- 0.2 SEM) for both CLF and ALF groups.	2.07177645374828
In patients with end stage liver disease standard rules for substitution with AT III-concentrate are adequate only for patients with CLF.	2.1148150015273353
In patients with ALF higher AT III doses are required to achieve the expected effect on endogenous AT III activity.	2.0025977277405898
Procoagulant activity, as reflected by PT, can be increased by 1% when 1.6 IU/kg PPSB concentrate is given.	2.152232284860163
An increased volume of distribution and increased turnover may explain the poor recovery of AT III activity in the ALF group, indicating that the dose of coagulation concentrate should be estimated against the background of the patient's clinical symptoms and diagnosis.	2.0698367492568837
Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis.	3.516863806699955
Rapid exhaustion and reduced exercise tolerance leads to difficulties in maintaining a normal daily life for many patients.	1.89613527164818
A sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time.	2.2684954147806025
Both occasions were associated with menstruation.	2.6096551826776255
Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in the tracheal secretions once.	2.349226066105745
Discussion: The etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described.	2.5482909918385577
The toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 acts as a superantigen in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	2.0410825294860095
This case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar immunopathogenetic process.	2.196652313961163
Porokeratos of Mibelli is a rare inherited disorder of epidermal keratinization, whose pathogenesis is not fully understood.	2.281973144493105
The common clinical feature is a erythematous plaque surrounded by a hyperkeratotic border.	2.045471525759177
The histopathologic hallmark is a parakeratotic cornoid lamella.	2.1739658713156302
An unusual case of porokeratosis gigantea, a morphological variant of classical porokeratosis of Mibelli, is reported.	1.8845040102957766
The pathogenesis, taking in account especially the clonal hypothesis and premalignant nature of porokeratosis, is discussed.	1.874518743271325
With the introduction of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines.	2.266151144177408
We report two cases with high-dose usage and dependency of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	2.301918969835024
Both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occuring during a depressive episode.	1.9694518231136222
While one patient had a polysubstance abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient.	2.4968944497488
Thus, it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	2.6631452952383468
Considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	1.9403678510613247
Fractures of the proximal radius in children may lead to deformities of the radial head and functional disturbance of pro- and supination.	2.500255208558833
However, traumatization is not only caused by the injury itself, but may also occur secondary to surgical reduction, manipulation of fracture fragments and excessive physiotherapy.	2.2072273339755166
In a prospective long-term follow-study (2-20 years after trauma) of 38 children with displaced proximal radius fractures we found functional disturbances in 11 % of children only.	2.129360755739542
These were not caused by radial head deformities, which were present on 83 % of follow-up radiographs.	2.5157059752055897
Functional impairment was mainly seen after open reduction or secondary growth disturbances.	2.218250666432279
On follow-up radiographs all conservatively treated fracture angulations up to 60  ° had corrected themselves spontaneously.	2.242594472916881
In view of the high complication rates after open reduction and the poor functional results, as well as the inconvenience for the pediatric patient and the economic aspects, we recommend a primary conservative treatment concept of proximal radius fractures in children.	2.434062419224723
Patients who have undergone cardiac surgery with use of extracorporeal circulation frequently reveal marked hypovolaemia in spite of a highly positive fluid balance.	2.076637799675504
This is thought to be due to transient microvascular damage and extravascular fluid shift.	2.3785296024755493
Further volume replacement to achieve haemodynamic stability in the postoperative period may cause fluid overload and congestive heart failure.	2.0855885431783667
The present study was designed to investigate whether this fluid overload could be avoided by using a hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution (group I: HHL, 10% hydroxyethylstarch 200/0.5 in 7.2% saline) instead of two different standard colloid solutions (group II: HA, 5% albumin; group III: HES, 6% hydroxyethylstarch in 0.9% saline).	1.8028409698546166
Purpose: The temporomandibular joint is a place of motion where release of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces cartilage destruction via production of nitric oxide (NO).	1.9979795321566858
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous passive motion in the form of cyclic stretch on the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).	2.0382518439153743
Methods: Articular chondrocytes were harvested from rabbit cartilage slices and cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.	1.81398641162294
Subsequently, cells (105/ml per well) were transferred to Flexercell plates, grown to 90% confluency, and subjected to one of the following regimens: (1) no mechanical strain (10 Hz, 20% elongation rate); (2) rhIL-1 (1 ng/ml); (3) mechanical strain; (4) mechanical strain and rhIL-1.	2.225569745991477
The cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged on microscope slides in a cytospin centrifuge.	1.831316545557094
The presence of iNOS was determined by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using polyclonal rabbit anti-iNOS as primary antibodies, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as secondary antibodies.	1.7065180588497877
Diaminobenzidine was used as substrate for HRP.	2.5130943285506175
Total NO production was spectrophotometrically measured in the supernatants of cultures using Greiss reaction.	1.951759702166561
All experiments were done in triplicates and the statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t-test.	2.1471067547640676
Results: Cells with treatment 1 and 3 did not exhibit presence of iNOS.	2.3120389331424716
IL-1-treated cells in group 2 exhibited intense peroxidase staining.	2.7040864518109555
Cells in group 4 exposed to IL-1 and mechanical stress showed staining with considerably less intensity.	2.1053988232725755
Control cells treated with normal rabbit IgG as a primary antibody did not exhibit peroxidase staining.	2.1695518622414998
The data were further confirmed by measurement of statistically significant differences of NO levels in supernatants assessed in the four different treatment groups.	2.0312237054113313
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that continuous passive motion exerts anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes, downregulating the quantity of iNOS -positive cells.	1.965045440368153
Since NO acts as an intracellular, transcellular, and cytotoxic molecule, it has a basic importance for proper post-traumatic and postoperative TMJ function as well as the course and therapy of inflammatory TMJ diseases.	2.272761875409422
Recently, we presented an implantable piezoelectrical hearing aid transducer.	2.1278178915224384
Its characteristics make it suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	2.68360389191998
The transducer transmits micromechanical vibrations instead of sound into the hearing organ.	2.0331212823694766
Efficiency of the transducer implant was investigated in ten cat ears.	2.4512590511162364
BERA responses were recorded following stimulation of umbo, long incus process, stapes head, stapes foot plate, and vestibulum.	1.8590371160428276
By comparing the acoustical and mechanical threshold, a correlation was found between the stimulus level of acoustical and mechanical stimulation.	2.074573823714306
An electrical transducer voltage of 1 Vrms* was equivalent to sound-pressure levels between 100 and 128 dB SPL at the tympanic membrane.	1.8723614103822201
To judge hearing impression, stimulus-dependent latencies of the early acoustically and mechanically evoked potentials (waves P1 to P5) and their thresholds were analyzed.	1.9242143318477414
After coupling the piezoelectrical transducer to the long incus process, latencies corresponded well to stimulation.	2.061355003284498
They were almost completely similar when the equivalent sound-pressure level of 100 dB SPL was achieved by the transducer voltage level.	2.0326944385873245
Pyoderma gangrenosum was first described in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.	1.9811070796529553
Nevertheless we found some illustrations in an atlas on dermatology, published by Marie-Nicolas Devergie in the first half of the 19th century, which appear to be pyoderma gangrenosum.	2.0090443793149295
In addition to discussions of typical syphilitic affections of the skin, Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" includes illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which appeared unexpectedly after local and systemic therapy with mercury.	1.7675495555425145
Devergie interpreted those enlarging ulcers as a side effect of mercury therapy.	2.2378242957825876
Thus we were able to find evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum more than 100 years before first description in 1930.	2.2030039043100897
The etiology of this clinical picture is still unsettled.	2.430938731812074
The favorite postulate has been a bacterial genesis which was the subject of numerous publications until the 1960s.	2.253810338741924
Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by progressive autonomic failure with cerebellar, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs.	2.0387122314576955
In MSA patients laryngoscopy often reveals unilateral or bilateral abductor vocal fold palsies.	1.9906524899627638
However, assessment of sites of obstruction and their severity is needed.	2.1145925751341497
We report our clinical experience in managing a 56-year-old, obese male MSA patient (1.76 m height, 100 kg weight, BMI 32.3 kg/m2) who was admitted for evaluation of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness.	1.9745846106813907
Endoscopy while awake demonstrated an incomplete abductor vocal fold palsy.	2.1644039390121734
Polysomnography confirmed heavy snoring with arousals (11.1/h) and an RDI of 1.4/h.	2.062129833655175
Sleep efficiency was low (51.9%) due to long intermittent awake periods.	2.1257682916549023
Sleep videoendoscopy of the upper airway proved the entire pharynx to be open during REM and non-REM sleep.	2.2670732338876416
During inspiration fluttering movements of the vocal cords caused the snoring.	2.2683155849599617
This was regularly terminated by arousals.	2.331310521886811
The further treatment is discussed.	2.6584720363259993
In general, glottic snoring without daytime stridor is rare and has only been described in MSA patients.	2.1126944456467314
However, certain of these patients will also be pharyngeal snorers.	2.60881379948648
The source of the sound and site of obstruction can only be diagnosed by sleep videoendoscopy.	2.376573117257439
Introduction: Homografts for valve replacement are indicated in acute valve endocarditis.	2.2408511403857703
It is assumed that they possess anti-infective properties.	2.0614399866298667
Homografts are an established indication in aortic valve replacement.	2.522465870540141
We present our early results with homografts for mitral valve replacement in acute endocarditis.	2.0415660865010246
The surgical management of enlarged inferior turbinates has been actively debated for more than a century.	2.0702342365638993
The second part of this review decribes the following techniques: laterofracture, submucous turbinectomy, concho-antropexy, partial turbinectomy, anterior turbinectomy, inferior turbinoplasty, total turbinectomy, and vidian neurectomy.	1.7573329242636855
Indications, advantages, disadvantages, complications, and controversies of each treatment modalitiy are reviewed and discussed.	2.0492075278010975
Total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed.	1.9633079103675954
Acute oxalosis is an important disorder causing serious abnormalities.	2.569688932088895
Furthermore, chronic asymptomatic intestinal oxalosis may turn symptomatic by a superimposed major load of oxalate.	1.912147837185253
Acute oxalosis results in acute renal failure; in addition oxalate-induced angiopathy may be associated with necrosis of affected tissue.	2.153882725306257
The diagnosis of acute oxalosis requires a demonstration of oxalate crystals in the urine and in other affected tissues.	2.0085744672055825
In terms of therapy, hemodialysis should be used promptly in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and a worsening of the renal function.	2.36673382965758
In cases of a secondary chronic intestinal oxalosis prophylactic measures such as maintaining an elevated urinary flow rate and prescribing oral calcium supplements will be helpful.	1.8657027812934024
Generalized granuloma annulare is a rare variant of granuloma annulare affecting the trunk and extremities with a multitude of lesions.	2.3075947103965873
In contrast to localized granuloma annulare, generalized granuloma annulare occurs in older patients, shows a stronger association with diabetes, and is characteristically chronic.	2.1058987360638204
Like our 55-year-old patient, most patients present with papules and annular plaques; less often, macular or non-annular lesions may be encountered.	2.1229538820664744
Instead, there are diffuse dermal, band-like or nodular aggregations of histiocytes intermingled with some multinucleated giant cells and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the periphery.	1.8912931382587994
Because of its special characteristics, it has been suggested that generalized granuloma annulare might constitute a separate disease entity and that it should be classed among the primary cutaneous histiocytoses as a diffuse dermal histiocytosis.	2.0089297673812525
Using immunohistochemistry to determine the macrophage phenotype of the lesional histiocytes, we have shown that generalized granuloma annulare is not a cutaneous histiocytosis.	2.5977814223422686
Neither MS-1 high-molecular-weight protein, a new specific marker for cutaneous non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses, nor CD1a, the well-known marker for Langerhans cells and Langerhans cell histiocytoses, is expressed by the lesional histiocytes of our patient.	1.877659879316849
In contrast, the antigen expression pattern was diagnostic for non-infectious granulomas and was highly similar to that in localized granuloma annulare.	2.0602724181991166
The aims of the study were: (1) to predict reversal time from intensive atracurium blockade; and (2) to determine the optimal time of neostigmine administration during recovery from atracurium blockade, i.e., the time at which the administration of neostigmine results in the shortest total recovery time (time from administration of last supplemental dose of atracurium to train-of-four [TOF] ratio 0.70), and at the same time results in the shortest time from administration of neostigmine to TOF ratio 0.70.	2.306291003784967
The spontaneous and neostigmine-facilitated recovery in 52 healthy women anaesthetised with thiopentone, fentanyl, droperidol, and nitrous oxide was followed.	1.870586013966212
Post-tetanic count (PTC) of TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve and mechanomyography were used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission.	1.9759310217163846
The neuromuscular blockade was induced with atracurium 0.6 mg/kg and supplemental doses of 0.15 mg/kg were given when the first twitch response in the TOF (TH1) had recovered to 20%.	2.0943173579889827
Neostigmine 0.036 mg/kg body weight was given at different levels of neuromuscular blockade to 37 of the patients.	2.565293940267475
Multiple regression analyses including pre-reversal time (time from administration of the last atracurium dose to neostigmine administration), PTC, weight, and age of the patients suggest that pre-reversal time is the best predictor of reversal time: reversal time=27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time [min]; (SEE=6.0 min).	1.9564433167583113
If pre-reversal time is unknown, PTC can be used: reversal time=24 min-(4.5xln PTC) at time of reversal); (SEE=6.8 min).	2.059594312365475
Total recovery time was 47 min (SEM=2.0 min, n=15) in the patients allowed to recover spontaneously, and 29 min (SEM=1.2 min, n=29) in the patients reversed by neostigmine; the difference of 18 min (SE diff 2.0 min) was significant (P<0.0005).	2.139378901328791
The level of blockade indicated by PTC (1 - 24) at the time of reversal had no influence on the total recovery time.	2.503782403008655
The spontaneous recovery times from reappearance of TH1 and TH1=10% to TOF ratio 0.70 were 29.2 min (SEM=1.7 min) and 24.4 min (SEM=2.6 min), respectively.	1.8816363387749364
The results suggest that pre-reversal time is the strongest predictor of reversal time when neostigmine is administered during intense atracurium blockade.	1.8648261288490395
To achieve the optimal time-saving effect, neostigmine must be given 18 min (the time saved by giving neostigmine) plus 7 to 11 min (needed for neostigmine to reach its peak effect), giving a total of 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70.	1.8866683308391636
As TH1 is between 1% and 10% 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70 is reached during spontaneous recovery, the optimal level of neuromuscular blockade for neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade is when TH1 is between 1% and 10%.	1.789712900271197
Reversal time can be predicted as 27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time (min), and the optimal time of neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade appears to be when TH1 is 1% - 10%.	2.2515229994777397
A seminar for hospital physicians in management positions (Württembergische Verwaltungs- und Wirtschaftsakademie, Stuttgart) in October 1994 illustrated the immediate relevance of W. R. Bion's book Experiences in Groups and Other Papers, published in 1961.	1.6131847296698727
The aim of this article, recalling Bion's experiences in groups by presenting in seminar's leadership principles, is to show how these experiences can be applied to an understanding of the individual.	2.1543909645671295
If continuous seizure activity lasts longer than 5 minutes generalized tonic-clonic seizures require prompt treatment, if significant morbidity and mortality are to be avoided.	2.0474396020511096
The mortality varies (mean: 20%) depending on patient age and etiology.	2.116769543159225
Control of status epilepticus is achieved by benzodiazepines in about 80% of cases: Lorazepam is recommended due to its longer-acting effects on the central nervous system.	2.167399719478037
To maintain the anticonvulsive effect phenytoin is usually administered intravenously.	2.094018324324322
Fosphenytoin (not approved in Germany) has advantages over phenytoin, because it can be given three times more rapidly and produces fewer side effects.	2.125366076735181
The IV use of valproic acid in status epilepticus seems to be promising, but needs further evaluation.	2.16242846824108
There is no generally accepted treatment protocol for the therapy of persistent seizure activity lasting more than 60 minutes (i. e., refractory status epilepticus).	2.0835049828060623
Usually phenobarbital, or general anesthesia with thiopental or pentobarbital are treatment recommendations.	2.0549164411432423
In recent reports, the administration of midazolam or propofol proved to be effective and well-tolerated.	2.663664965311318
Since the life span of our society is increasing and the expectation of high functional demands is growing more and more older people take part in sports activities emphasises the necessity of early diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions and their correct treatment.	1.9430530695165062
The goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology.	2.254754496343621
New arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further.	1.949614664661366
In cases of large and complex cuff tears the surgeon can individually select an adequate reconstruction procedure which includes anatomical-, partial-, tendon-transfer and muscle-transfer repairs.	1.7601263991899367
In cases of irreparable tears with cuff-tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered.	1.8358694096330934
Based on clinical, radiological and arthroscopic findings we developed algorithms that will lead to the best suited procedure for a given lesion.	2.317339419046168
Almost all patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experience symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation during the course of the illness.	2.2320349584894696
These symptoms can develop  years before death and may severely affect quality of life.	2.1467744553291337
Non-invasive intermittent home mechanical ventilation (HMV) via mask is a possible palliative measure for  these symptoms, which is not often used in  Germany.	2.184372158132161
We report on our experience with HMV in 24 patients with ALS.	2.545293893246751
Our data show a good palliative effect in 17 of 24 treated patients.	2.222962039877735
Severe complications did not occur.	2.391895464312694
The mean ventilation time at present is  14 months.	2.1606120280569847
Available options and their  consequences need to be discussed in detail with patients and relatives before HMV is  initiated.	2.3648981709791816
Most studies, however, included variable follow-up intervals, neglecting the dynamic cell loss over the course of time.	2.723684343776325
The aim of this study was to perform endothelial cell evaluation 5 years after penetrating keratoplasty using two different storage methods.	1.9620777205897153
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is generally associated with ulcerative colitis (UC).	2.057583426040347
The disease typically progresses slowly, but ultimately, and leads to cirrhosis, liver failure or bile duct cancer.	1.966184340195317
At the present time, there is no effective treatment for PSC, although preliminary data show encouraging results after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid.	2.274066807456722
However, there are no data concerning the delay or prevention of progress of the disease with this drug, because follow-up time is not yet long enough.	2.4980086413563005
Isolated bile duct strictures should be treated endoscopically.	2.693437258972263
The possible effect of proctocolectomy on the course of PSC is controversial.	2.4110571904016993
Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for PSC in its final stage.	2.604974318843343
The 5-year survival rate (89 %) is significantly better than after transplantation for other indications.	2.1559717444531765
Patients with ulcerative colitis have to be followed up by lifelong colonoscopy.	2.6244421021561233
Although the course of UC after transplantation is mostly asymptomatic, these patients are at higher risk for colorectal cancer.	2.4421000632763055
On 3 June 1998 a high-speed train (Inter City Express, ICE) collided with a bridge at a speed of 200 km/h.	1.8463362627566522
The bridge collapsed and the rear wagons of the train were pushed into it with the power of the rear engine.	1.914394926942748
The accident caused 101 deaths and 103 injuries.	2.204793666957952
Four minutes after the accident the alarm was raised, and 16 minutes after the accident the first doctor was on the scene, arriving from Celle, approx.	1.9621320669355862
Severe complications after chiropractic treatments rarely occur.	2.262958810709566
They happen mostly when manipulating the atlantoaxial and the craniovertebral articulations or when not attending to the contraindications like partial dislocation and hemivertebra.	1.741948820036858
Therefore, x-ray pictures from the part of the vertebral region to be treated are inevitable and likewise the medical scientific associations demand them uniformly to minimize the risks.	2.292830424840155
Nevertheless, our case-report shows also inconspicuous radiological findings do not exclude local tumor infestation of the bones with possible deleterious results for the patient treated by the chiropractor.	1.94686687879019
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with the electron microscopy; cytoplasmic inclusions may be detected histologically.	2.080024243284752
Further useful diagnostic tools are the identification of the cowpox/catpox virus by PCR or in cell culture as well as serological tests to detect virus specific antibodies.	2.304247015073379
We report the development of typical skin lesions of a cowpox/catpox infection in two female patients who had contact with cows or cats.	2.272569543560691
Recent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are also discussed.	2.888503135338553
The laboratory findings of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets are signs of an acute pregnancy complication often associated with abdominal pain and intrauterine growth retardation.	2.1508075896661443
A high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed.	2.2475136382832597
The high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade.	2.206599966881371
However, the fact that HELLP syndrome can also occur for up to 1 week post-partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question, in particular, since there is a high rate of hemostasiological complications after cesarean section in acute HELLP syndrome.	2.1349428583951964
Because of the correlation of complications of HELLP syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia, the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features.	2.403055807764249
The results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in HELLP syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept.	1.9142817068101454
Innervation of the head and neck differs from other regions of the body in certain respects.	2.6494903618458627
In particular, besides the external cuneate nucleus, thick-calibre neck muscle afferents project directly, to the vestibular nuclear complex.	1.8321865737700456
This projection is most prominent in segments C2 and 3 and is sparse or absent in more caudal segments.	1.9625336136021254
Proprioceptive input via indirect spinovestibular pathways is also most prominent from C2 and 3 compared to more caudal levels.	1.9205596604024897
Likewise, thin calibre, mainly nociceptive afferents from cervical segments are channelled via the parabrachial nuclei in the rostral pons to limbic structures different from the targets of thoracolumbar afferents.	1.6986836440664137
It is tempting to consider these neuroantomical peculiarities relevant for the pathogenesis of the puzzling symptoms after whiplash injury.	2.13862290401822
In some recent German textbooks of pain management there is maintained that psychological dependence to opioids in pain patients is not a real problem.	2.0171780331683267
The evidence for this statement is reviewed.	2.396640681752232
Real bone tumors are rarely encountered in the daily routine of radiological practice.	2.374696746971847
Therefore, for a general radiologist there is no need for a specialist knowledge on this field.	2.6241325200329433
However, he should be able to distinguish benign from malignant lesions in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies.	2.404072262609747
A systematic approach towards osteolytic lesions, e. g. according to the classification of Lodwick, is mandatory.	2.4543700977841314
CT and MRI are indicated to clear up the anatomy in areas of superposition artefacts in conventional radiology and to determine the inner structure of a lesion, e. g. fatty tissue, liquid/solid.	2.1195938863629227
This paper highlights the advantages and disadvantages and the cost-effective use of the imaging modalities including scintigraphy in the diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor-like lesions.	2.6621741775904675
Guidelines for the management of bony lesions will be given in detail.	2.524658082683754
The option and necessity for a specialist second opinion is emphasized.	2.249879389497618
During routine middle ear surgery prototypes of implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducers were coupled to the ossicular chain of 28 patients.	2.0569614257461155
Pure tone thresholds in a broad frequency range (250 Hz-8 kHz) and perception of music were the basis of psychoacoustic evaluation of the transfer properties of the prototypes in this human study.	2.2203646914335193
The piezoelectric transducer reached an equivalent transducer sound-pressure level of up to 145 dB SPL and frequencies of 10 kHz.	1.9998667177019966
The dynamics for music reached 32 dB, which was identical with the results of the preoperative investigations using hi-fi headsets (33 dB).	2.278678010310699
The study is the basis for realizing a piezoelectric transducer designed for routine clinical implantations.	2.3268777678976407
The transducer is thought to be part of a totally implantable future hearing aid for rehabilitation of moderate and severe sensory neural hearing loss predominantly in the middle and high frequency range.	2.194045813824674
Background: Baker et al.	2.5088122178783983
used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty for the first time.	2.3585095296973
The ultrapulse CO2 laser provides a sophisticated instrument that makes more application alternatives possible in ophthalmology.	1.9277201409287352
Several investigations prove that monaural acoustic deprivation induces detrimental changes in the auditory pathway.	2.2300785561949334
So far the major interest focused on degenerative processes on the deprived side, while effects on the contralateral untreated side were not taken into consideration.	1.929874345890111
This ontogenetic study investigates effects of early monaural acoustic deprivation on the functional development of the acoustically evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) in the Mongolian gerbil.	2.1778466972030834
Young gerbils were deafened by a single intracochlear application of neomycin sulfate.	2.057607727358719
The ABR development on the contralateral side differed in a late developmental period from that of normally hearing animals.	2.082983066173274
These changes persisted until adulthood.	2.4165529599669524
Between day 55 and day 90 a significant 5 dB decrease of the ABR thresholds and a significant shortening of the interpeak latency II-V occured.	2.038212342394707
The results confirm that a complete monaural deprivation during the sensible or critical period leads on the contralateral side to plastic or compensatory changes in the auditory brainstem.	1.9700978481548
There are estimated to be 20 million people blinded by cataracts, 80-90 % of whom live in rural areas of developing countries where expert surgical resources are scarce.	1.8086161537762513
The majority of all cataract operations are still intracapsular extractions (ICCE).	1.93714872023317
Aphakic correction using spectacles is problematical in developing countries.	2.147002099068256
This study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of multiflex open loop anterior chamber intraocular lenses (AC IOLs).	2.102621978231731
Dorsal fusion with the internal fixator has become the standard treatment of instabilities and deformities of the thoracolumbar spine.	2.2465379589704146
With our new device, the modular spine fixator (MSF), which has been specially designed for short-distance instrumentations, we have increasingly been treating unstable injuries of the thoracolumbar spine by one-level stabilization.	2.120507865696022
Prerequisite is an accurate evaluation of the indication, including CT and MRI to assess the involvement of the intervertebral disc and the ligamental structures.	2.8418607430839296
The operative technique differs in some details from the procedure in moremulti-level instrumentations, especially concerning the application of the pedicle screws.	2.0660334668628884
The instrumentation is always combined with posterior allogenic bone grafting.	2.189384638775135
Since the beginning of 1993 we also perform anterior autogenic transpedicular bone grafting.	2.1204557409202143
Between Januar 1991 and July 1995, 57 one-level stabilizations with the MSF were performed.	1.994822280286235
Of the 57 patients operated on 39, 27 men and 12 women, with an average age of 41 years, have had a clinical and radiographic follow-up examination so far, on average, 27 months after the accident.	2.4137710990879264
Seventeen patients were completely free of pain and 17 patients (were only) sensivite to weather changes or had minor pain during great physical stress.	1.984069386516896
Five patients had pain even during slight physical stress or at rest.	2.0980034657656748
The preoperatively measured Cobb angle was 15.1  ° on average, after the operation 5.2  °, and at the time of the follow-up examination amounted to 8.1  °.	2.418440990430959
Only five minor complications have been seen.	2.603164153570805
No implant fatigue failure has been noted in this series.	2.2943423042464755
We derive from these results that, for correct indications, one-level stabilization can be performed successfully and should be firmly established in the operative treatment of unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.	2.4622044101982388
Between May 1995 and March 1996 we were able to diagnose and remove glomus tumors of the left nasal cavity from three female patients.	2.4036609275055723
Ages of the patients were 9, 36 and 74 years.	2.9048690225387737
All patients suffered from a frequent epistaxis and all were extremely sensitive to the slightest nasal touch.	2.124646800510042
One patient reported breathing difficulties due to nasal congestion.	2.134519167147634
Examination revealed a tumor that filled the entire nasal cavity.	2.271972208794161
The method of choice in treatment of these tumors is surgical removal.	3.067449810081922
Hemangiopericytoma, non-chromaffin paraganglioma,  hidradenoma, cavernous hemangioma and nevus cell nevi have to be excluded by histology and immunohistochemical techniques.	2.1399369898964857
From a clinical perspective the bleeding  septal polyp (granuloma telangiectaticum sive pyogenicum sive pediculatum) has to be considered because it often comes from Kieselbachi's plexus, has a mushroom-like appearance and bleeds slightly.	1.8496023566207613
Background: Gynaecological surgery including laparoscopy is frequently associated with PONV.	2.1998140548605103
Therefore, choosing an anaesthetic with only little side effects in operations eligible for outpatient surgery is at least as important as applying anaesthetics that enable fast-tracking.	1.9193569760417726
The reliability of continuous fibreoptic oximetry in cerebral venous blood and its correlation with intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures (pressure-volume curve) were examined in an experimental porcine study.	1.9441964137802281
In a population-based study of 110 women between 53 and 82 years of age (mean age 64.5 +/- 7.9 years) static posturography data were compared to functional items of gait and balance in common geriatric mobility scales.	1.9168641777082303
Posturographic data of double-stance with eyes open and eyes closed (DSEO; DSEC) did not differ from those of a group of healthy women previously tested for intact nervous system function.	2.028613323479072
The total neuromuscular score - roughly corresponding to the well-known Tinetti score - did not correlate to the posturographic measures.	2.0985760193198733
DSEC correlated with the items "rapid walking" and "single-stance left leg".	2.36082930156844
Age, vision, and neuropsychologic test results correlated with DSEO, "rapid walking", "single-stance right leg", "single-stance left leg", and "walking a figure eight".	1.8484796519979185
Multiple linear regression confirmed the impact of age, vision, DSEO, and DSEC on "rapid walking" with a 34% variance explanation.	2.0515312775226713
When used in older women living independently in the community, parameters of static posturography reflect to some extent the functional disabilities of gait and balance.	1.944745392249423
The ocular surface epithelia with the tear film as a unit provide clear vision and comfort and serve as the first line of defense.	1.938382331797752
It is important to understand how ocular surface health is maintained and how ocular surface failure occurs.	2.050678873742582
Furthermore, it is timely to summarize new information concerning action mechanisms and clinical uses of amniotic membrane transplantation for ocular surface reconstruction.	1.9701836481478792
When appropriately processed and preserved, amniotic membrane as a native matrix can be used as a graft to restore conjunctival surfaces following removal of lesions such as pterygium, tumor, scar, symblepharon, and conjunctivochalasis.	1.8523249534394954
It can also be used as a graft to restore corneal surfaces suffering from limbal stem-cell deficiency.	2.1864959047441856
For partial limbal deficiency, amniotic membrane alone is frequently sufficient, while for total limbal deficiency it needs to be combined with limbal stem-cell transplantation with or without corneal transplantation.	2.003075831983855
When used as a graft or patch, amniotic membrane can facilitate healing of persistent corneal ulcers and recurrent corneal erosion and reduce corneal haze following keratectomy.	1.8629054699303116
Reported data indicate that amniotic membrane transplantation facilitates rapid healing with recovery of a normal epithelial phenotype in the epithelium and reduces inflammation, vascularization, and scarring in the stroma.	1.8973404494101527
Purpose: Evalution of MRI in radiotherapy of humeroscapular periarthritis.	2.4154274438630505
According to the recommendations of the German Ophthalmological Sociaty (DOG), PRK in myopic patients between -1.0 dpt and -6.0 dpt is a scientific acknowled treatment.	1.8757739013523356
The risks of the treatment, however, increase in myopia above -6.0 dpt.	2.7512359161707862
Introduction: Improved socio-economic conditions have led to an increase of adult height during the last century.	2.6841717796171274
If excessive height is regarded as a serious psychological handicap, final height can be reduced by early and high doses treatment with sexual steroids.	2.1324432244774028
This therapy influences pubertal development and growth of healthy adolescents.	2.1990707239683376
For that reason patients should be carefully selected, taking into account the benefits and possible side effects.	2.3136159823943827
Colour measurements were performed on powdery substances of whitish to slightly yellow colouring (cocaine samples of different composition) in order to give an unequivocal optical description of the samples and relate them to control samples.	2.046745838396042
The measurements were carried out with a spectrophotometer (Carl-Zeiss-Jena GmbH, MCS 400) using a halogen bulb as light source (standard illuminant D65).	1.7710824452223095
Colorimetric classification was made on the basis of the CIE-L*a*b*-values.	2.170242019641506
The examination showed that specimens of similar or different chemical composition which could not be distinguished macroscopically revealed characteristic differences in the CIE-L*a*b*-measures.	1.9805685378953608
The method gives a first clue for orientation within a few minutes when comparing substances in specimens of different origin.	2.0375245214683435
Eighty-five patients with grade 2 or grade 3 sprains of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint were evaluated clinically and radiographically 32 months after injury.	2.0856905542944495
Group I included 34 patients with grade 2 sprains (Tossy II) and group II included 51 patients with grade 3 injuries (Tossy III).	2.085607916188415
In group I, 15 patients were treated surgically (group I a) and 19 patients were treated conservatively (group I b), while in group II, 41 patients were treated surgically (group II a) and 10 patients were treated conservatively (group II b).	2.6351187372670326
At surgery open reduction and transarticular fixation of the AC joint with Kirschner wires was performed.	2.366924804262361
Conservative treatment included the initial use of a sling or a knapsack bandage and early performance of range-of-motion exercises.	2.11928815864181
Shoulder function was assessed according to the score devised by Constant and Murley.	2.4763320336188883
In both groups, 97 of 100 possible points (minimum 72, maximum 100) were obtained after conservative and after surgical treatment.	2.0115717859917446
Nine of 10 patients (90%) with grade 3 sprains (group IIb) had more pronounced displacement and increased mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle after conservating treatment.	2.22070341727503
After surgery, dislocation and increased horizontal, mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle occurred in 18 (44%) of 41 patients with grade 3 sprains (group II a P<0.0001).	2.245982341552746
However, these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	2.201747213310836
At follow-up there was a significant increase in degenerative changes seen on radio-graphs (P<0.035) in all patients.	2.2682928980003942
Again these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	2.3230296249345948
More degenerative radiological changes were observed in patients who had undergone surgery (P<0.003).	2.5848561335978046
Patients with grade 2 sprains were more frequently restricted in sporting activity after surgery (P<0.05).	2.054791124931199
Patients with grade 3 sprains who were treated surgically complained of pain more frequently (P<0.01), and they returned to work later than patients who were treated conservatively after grade 3 sprains.	2.5850390583179284
An additional rehabilitation program guided by a physiotherapist seemed to have no impact on the functional outcome.	2.225106052103452
A total of 56 patients were treated by surgery.	2.870537353396437
Among these patients 11 complications occurred, requiring five additional surgical procedures.	2.062678645844698
Among 29 conservatively treated patients, only in 1 patient did subacromially located arthritic changes of the AC joint have to be removed.	2.5056436158000075
Various therapeutic modalities such as antihistamines, intralesional injection or topical application of corticosteroids, etretinate, UVB irradiation and dermoabrasion have been employed with variable success.	1.8375457629798373
Recently, in a few case reports authors have observed encouraging beneficial clinical effects by using topical dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).	1.9641120276883708
In our study 10 patients with either MA or LA or biphasic amyloidosis were treated with a 50% solution of DMSO in water.	2.184840069221028
9 of them showed marked clinical improvement at the end of 6-20 weeks of treatment.	2.4676039449814167
Degranulation and depletion of the mast cells by DMSO is the most probable explanation for the rapid improvement of itching beginning within the first week of therapy.	2.3582835743268764
Remarkable flattening of the lichenoid papules which was obtained within 11 weeks of treatment is interpreted as a result of the improvement of itching and the related scratch effect.	2.3873328041494486
Histological examination after treatment revealed no disappearance of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis.	2.15504395884208
In the follow-up period relapses of itching and papules were observed.	2.361457399976379
Therefore further studies are needed to find out the optimal procedure of therapy.	2.5621468024880416
As early as 1974, Brian advocated the prone position for ventilated patients [5].	2.0607968382429003
He suggested that this position might enhance ventilation of the dorsal parts of the lungs, thereby improving oxygenation.	2.381822292474644
These considerations have been confirmed by several experimental and clinical studies [1, 6, 13, 17].	2.40816731384428
Better secretion removal, decreased intrapulmonary shunting, and an increased FRC are thought to be responsible for the observed improvement of oxygenation.	2.3607291953902005
However, the prone position never became very popular in the clinical treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	2.1844668214210463
Routine performance of thoracic CT scans in ARDS patients demonstrated preferential distribution of pathological densities in the dependent lung areas.	1.96075632525506
The prone position therefore could possibly benefit these patients, as shown by two recent studies [8, 11].	2.3527312663528335
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position on gas exchange and thoracic CT findings in multiple-trauma patients.	2.107261490255669
Seven ventilated intensive care patients with severe ARDS (Murray Score >2.5 [9], Quotient >0.7 [4], mean airway pressure >18 cm H2O, thoracic CT scan showing dorsal atelectases) were included in the study.	2.059854091715101
Patients were turned from the supine to the prone position at 12-h intervals using an air-cushion bed (Mediscus, Austria).	1.8518153008335525
Redistribution of dystelectatic or atelectatic dependent lung areas was verified by means of repeated thoracic CT scans (Figs.	2.217707190697783
The patients were intermittently turned for 6.5  +/-  1.1 days.	2.0769487412533674
The course of gas exchange is shown in Figs.	2.3158170696140985
Initially, improvement of the respiratory quotient could only be achieved during prone positioning, from the 2nd day in the supine position as well.	2.434570933115929
No significant changes in cardiovascular parameters could be observed.	2.354820348502399
Control thoracic CT scans showed uniform reduction of atelectases in dependent lung areas (Figs.	2.126622142805373
The inspiratory fraction of oxygen could be reduced significantly as of the 2nd day (Fig.	2.2210893778539864
Constant levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume were associated with decreasing mean and plateau airway pressures (Fig.	2.012867572048403
Repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position produced long-lasting improvement of arterial oxygenation, which persists up to the end of the weaning process.	2.355927626215285
This is in good accordance with other studies [1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17], however, this is the first study to report an observation period of more than 6 days of repeatedly turning the patient.	2.4032851903984223
These positive effects on gas exchange can be attributed to sudden improvement of the ventilation-perfusion ratio within the lung areas that become dependent after turning to the prone position.	2.0428326232621696
Due to reduced hydrostatic pressure [11] and relative hyperventilation [7, 16], previously collapsed alveoli are recruited in the lung areas that become non-dependent after turning to the prone position.	1.7849765833754967
After a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin, a 63 year old patient developed right-sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia, septic-toxic circulatory failure, and thrombocytopenia.	1.9500055783633452
Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT) type II was diagnosed.	2.154024758029437
Because of contraindications against thrombolysis a cava-filter was implanted, heparin therapy was stopped, and anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin was started.	1.86393875271095
Inspite of this, an arterial thrombosis of the A. femoralis superficialis developed and had to be treated surgically.	2.6056161229164227
From this time on, no further thromboembolic complications were noticed.	2.2131352950014396
Overlapping coumarin therapy was begun.	2.530070837153862
Due to ubiquitous coumarin-necrosis, rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy.	1.7503848073048982
A second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin-necrosis without the need for re-operation.	2.044216498525409
Subsequent coumarin-therapy, which was gradually increased over two weeks, was without further complications.	2.3795975772221647
Thus, hirudin appears to be a new and safe alternative to a therapy with the heparinoid danaparoid in HAT type II with fulminant thromboembolic complications and especially in coumarin-necrosis with critical septic-toxic circulatory failure and DIC.	2.0235073739646254
A prospective process-analysis evaluating organizational, medical and medical-technical alterations and real-time-documentation during out-of-hospital resuscitations (n=71) was performed due to the definitions of the "Utstein-Style".	2.0285806419642913
The gaseous radical nitric oxide (NO) is catalyzed by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by one cytokine inducible form (iNOS), which becomes active only within hours after the inducing event, and by two constitutively expressed forms, endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS), which are regulated by the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+.	1.8397902045556684
Brain nNOS is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons, which are all excited by glutamate via the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which controls a Ca2+ channel.	1.8028153195698886
After its diffusion into the extraneuronal space, NO may activate in neurons, which as a rule do not stain for NOS, soluble guanylyl cyclase and formation of cGMP as an intracellular messenger.	1.733959923961327
Beyond that, NO is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation.	2.134186587639803
NO as a nitrosylating agent enhances disulfide bonding of vicinal sulfhydryl (thiol) groups of the redox modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex and thereby down-regulates its Ca2+ channel activity.	1.7062197560647427
Histochemically studies have revealed the presence of large number of NOS containing neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of hypothalamic nuclei.	2.1916388395445954
Numerous studies conform to the view that NO participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes, especially of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurosecretory system.	1.9954181687043957
The redox-modulatory site of the NMDA receptor appears, therefore, as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	2.1077663970718588
Moreover, glucocorticoids augment neuronal excitotoxicity by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake.	1.9750303333778043
In attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with NO, it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox-environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of NO, acting either as a transmitter or neuromodulator or, in the worst case, causing neurodestruction.	1.9378040700025743
It seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs oxidized thiols within the central nervous system influences neuronal excitability, with NO working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition, which may alter acutely or chronically, among others, the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system.	1.7940588383844642
Purpose: To study early and late findings of macular retinal thickness in patients with hypotony following filtering procedures.	2.3475476408960074
Even in the era of coronary stenting, acute coronary artery occlusion continues to represent a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).	2.0095714408045438
Despite application of heparin and aspirin, abrupt vessel closure still occurs in 2-8%, depending on the definition applied.	2.25468580529189
Especially patients receiving PTCA for acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for abrupt vessel closure.	2.302384862539713
The formation of an intracoronary thrombus plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abrupt vessel closure.	2.3210062664375792
Dipyridamole induces dilatation of coronary arteries and prevents platelet aggregation by a mechanism that differs from that of aspirin.	2.089207621938257
The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adjunctive local intracoronary therapy with dipyridamole could reduce the incidence of coronary artery occlusion following PTCA.	2.5024129924923186
Secondary endpoints were defined as myocardial infarction, necessity for bypass grafting, and death.	2.2574653375054266
The intravesical instillation of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) in cases of relapsed superficial bladder cancer is an acknowledged kind of prophylaxis.	1.9380487969912747
It is uncertainly up to now whether a verification of the immune systems competence is necessary.	2.2547058955794648
The recommendations in this problem are very different.	2.404126365013794
In conclusion to the recent literature we think that a verification of the immune system before BCG installation in the urinary bladder has not a prognostic value.	2.0466888522541984
Additionally, the legal obligingness of this immunotest is doubtful.	2.061327835810422
There is at the moment no consensus on the aetiology of discoid meniscus.	2.3174446890405855
According to Watanabe three types can be differentiated: the complete form, the incomplete form and the hypermobile Wrisberg form.	2.031298763015198
Discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment.	2.169445259272402
Partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form, while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice, since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible.	2.4184428228912176
A fourteen years old girl showed the classic signs of acrocephalosyndactyly I: dysostosis craniofacialis with hypertelorism, exophthalmus, strabism, amblyopia and cleft palate as well as syndactyly of the fingers and toes.	1.9388968572319736
The feet showed on both side a 6  cm long horny band.	2.098916247237718
Since the twelfth year of life, she had suffered from papulo-pustular acne with many comedomes.	2.14777374094288
Her menstruation started one year later.	2.6046005358310707
At time of her birth, her father was 54 years old, and her mother 36 years old.	2.0664351680135344
Two elder siblings are healthy.	2.459318423493887
The inheritance of acrocephalosyndactyly I is usually autosomal dominant, but sporadic cases are frequent.	2.031692489490544
Objective: Cognitive dysfunction is a known problem after operations and may be especially relevant in the elderly.	2.284857575921105
The aim of this international multicentre study was to investigate short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients and to elucidate the relevance of hypoxaemia and hypotension as causative factors.	2.2497945739986713
Autosomal recessive inheritance, intrauterine growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, distinct facial dysmorphism, psychomotoric retardation, and often uncharacterized eczematous skin lesions distinguish the rare Dubowitz syndrome.	1.7421971510223166
Here a pair of monozygotic twins with Dubowitz syndrome and clear-cut atopic eczema is presented.	2.0434351188486026
Humeral shaft fractures can be treated either conservatively or operatively.	2.6246687541587272
Plating of the humerus is the established operative method, but recently interest has also been focussed on intramedullary nailing.	2.1967051121738894
Fifty-nine cases of humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (Seidel/Marchetti-Vicenzi/Prévot) from January 1991 to December 1995 (44 fractures after trauma, 11 pathological fractures, 3 pseudarthroses, 1 re-fracture).	1.7419525261976725
Closed reduction in 55/59 cases.	2.3825719006951473
One infection (soft tissue); 2/48 pseudarthrosis (indication for nailing: pseudarthrosis!).	1.9702057119550047
No iatrogenic palsy of the radial nerve.	2.7411512364034576
Functional postoperative treatment in all 44 cases of humeral fractures after adequate trauma.	2.147772718821786
One poor functional result: periarticular ossification after retrograde nailing, possibly connected with long-term respiratory treatment after trauma.	2.1727982431799964
Treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary nailing is favoured in our clinic (low complication rates, excellent or good functional results, limited approaches, small scars).	2.0435372905645397
All other fractures of the humeral shaft can be treated by each of the implants used in our clinic.	2.901935371420239
Pathological fractures are an excellent indication for intramedullary stabilization.	2.3769753845735107
These patients benefit from stable fixation without intense surgical trauma.	2.1573957233544645
Pseudarthrosis, according to our limited experience, seems to require plating plus bone grafting.	2.25139671508456
Plating is also recommended if revision of the radial nerve becomes necessary.	2.3366615240852573
2-4 % of vascular injuries need operative reconstruktion.	2.692214479109908
In polytraumatized patients the rate is even 10 %.	2.4244298799666084
Arterial vascular repair should precede venous reconstruction and orthopaedic stabilization due to limb threatening ischemia.	1.9321694452337028
Penetration or blunt vascular trauma result either in acute blood loss, ischemia or compartmental compression.	2.0673682885370614
Reperfusion syndrom leads to vital threat of patient.	2.293520182337908
Clinical assessment, measurement of limb pressures using a Doppler device and use of duplex ultrasonography are reliable adjuncts in the rapid evaluation.	1.9985386617233791
Arteriography is rarely indicated and should be spared for patients with abnormal physical examination.	2.683191440677211
Vascular repair include direct anastomosis or lateral suture repair mostly combined with primary shortening of the extremity.	2.134950205968115
In most cases autogenous vein graft is required.	2.1927269169033363
Rethrombosis, arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysms are possible complications.	2.232543080134531
Stabilisation of the fracture has priority over vascular reconstruction.	2.581249109591458
The initial steps to success are surgical debridement, adequate bony stabilization mostly by external fixation, revascularisation of vascular injury, immediate fascial decompression and early soft-tissue reconstruction.	1.8921077113810394
The best results are obtained when a multidiciplinary approach is used combining expertise in orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.	2.024932627080343
In secondary prevention, statins are cost-effective and even more cost-effective than other lipid lowering drugs.	2.1712696527953295
Statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris.	2.681962362772855
For secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, statins should be administered generously.	2.38789323074183
In primary prevention, statins are effective but not cost-efficient.	2.1992778500025323
Unfavorable results have to be expected especially in premenopausal women, younger patients, and in those with a low risk factor profile.	3.0187013059691443
For population based primary prevention, only dietary measures can be advocated; however, apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven.	1.9889569722836034
Preventive measures have their own prize; in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it.	2.0773436918945944
Therefore, such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the "direct" medical costs.	2.2617895512978192
Furthermore, successful prevention of coronary heart disease leads, due to life-prolongation, to an increase in people out of work and in disabled patients due to age and/or disease.	2.442766541241275
Therefore, an increase especially of the "indirect" costs for unemployment, pension, nursing homes, etc.	2.161738340277788
Background: There are three fields where the the biochemical cardiac markers creatine kinase (CK), its isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), myoglobin, and troponin can play an important role: (1) the primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (2) identification of patients suffering from unstable angina with minor myocardial damage (MMD) and consecutively increased risk for major cardiovascular events, and (3) assessment of coronary reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis.	2.0261426485832876
MRSA/MRSE infections are a major problem in hospitals and although in orthopaedic units the incidence is low awareness of this problem is necessary.	2.173133972026185
Once a MRSA strain has been isolated the strict use of the hygiene precautions has to be applied to avoid epidemic spread of the strain.	2.4072631152059762
The patient has to be isolated.	3.1000499362996794
The staff has to use gloves and gowns whilst treating the patient.	2.0638368221079073
A antimicrobiel hand wash solution has to be used after taking off the gloves and before leaving the isolation room.	2.1559821741136482
Patient and staff have to be informed about the pathogenity and the way of infection spread so that infection precaution rules are fulfilled.	2.206728711561022
Antibiotics should only be used in clinically well defined cases and the overall use of antibiotics should be reduced to lower the incidence of MRSA/E isolates.	2.521689261173292
The problems of an MRSA case and its successful treatment are demonstrated.	2.1522309656858223
A microphone constructed for implantation in the posterior wall of the auditory canal and a piezoelectric transducer serving as the main components of an implantable hearing aid were temporally implanted in five patients during middle ear surgery under local anesthesia.	2.0784841478801597
The microphone was positioned beneath the skin of the auditory canal such that it completely covered the microphone membrane.	2.005357600372376
The vibratory element of the transducer was coupled to the malleus in four patients with normal ossicular chains and directly to the stapes in one patient with missing incus.	2.2065115690720223
The microphone and transducer were electrically connected with an external battery-driven signal amplifier.	2.0099022541603344
Speech material and music were presented in the operation room at a sound level of 65 dB SPL under free-field conditions.	1.952988997837895
The patients had to estimate the quality of speech, music, and their own voice as well as the effects of bone-conducting noises.	2.7622426534235665
All patients were able to hear with the system.	2.3473823514266483
An intraoperative talk without vision contact was possible without any problems, as was understanding of numerals ("Freiburger Zahlentest").	1.8885919353867087
Perception of music was judged as "clear and undistorted with all broadband component."	2.003333557580594
The estimation was also valid for one patient with a sensorineural hearing loss.	2.454017052748032
One patient declared the music to be "a little of unnatural."	2.504670298347181
Bone-conducted sound was estimated as normal in two patients, better than without an implant in one patient with sensorineural hearing loss, and "somewhat metallic" in another patient.	2.2200154913321684
An amplification factor that can be technically realized in an implantable hearing aid was necessary for one of the patients with sensorineural hearing loss to perceive music at a pleasant volume.	2.47577527445586
On the basis of this study, essential requirements for the construction of a fully implantable hearing aid are fulfilled.	2.6985501590860808
We report a patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) with a first manifestation of homicide.	2.346374555360681
On admission the patient showed a hebephrenia-like syndrom with inappropriate affect, thought disorder and  behavioral changes.	1.9034877193969824
Magnetic resonance  tomography (MRT) findings suggested a  diagnosis of MLD, which was confirmed by a decreased activity of leucocyte arylsulfatase A and an excessive urinary sulfatide excretion.	2.1008347194091805
The cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the most frequent spinal dysfunction.	2.66914424360452
Its spontaneous course is very variable, from progress to stagnation.	2.1605612994691628
This makes prognosis and decision-making difficult for conservative or operative treatment.	2.2617029724770616
The authors attempt to provide some basis for decision-making by observing the individual course of neural dysfunction, consideration of morphometric data and the use of functional scores.	2.077123579609531
To advise a patient, the outcome of conservative and operative treatment as described in the literature has to be considered, as well as the possible complications.	2.990689133021723
The advantages and disadvantages of surgery from the anterior and posterior approach are discussed.	2.3055428974470558
Operative planning according to the individual condition is suggested.	2.9306071216414384
Operative techniques of anterior decompression and fusion are contrasted to laminoplasties.	2.1443128804122984
Subject: In a 7;11 year old boy with trichotillomania (ICD-10 F63.3), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (ICD-10 F90.1), and subclinical minimal cerebral dysfunction, Methylphenidate (Ritalin) medication resulted in a remarkable improvement: unexspected interruption of trichotillomania with regrowth of hair.	2.0379393958280585
An essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ECG signal is the splitting of the ECG into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees, neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information.	2.0577145818557003
The correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria.	2.5124494919591993
The analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure.	2.4402318449219473
This paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ECG.	2.2494776288978735
Unlike the methods used up to now, this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ECG signal into individual features.	2.384998688363986
Furthermore, analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other.	2.1419182683041766
The consideration underlying the procedure is that two ECGs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses.	1.8990740958739545
As this assumption is the basis of medical experience, it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ECG with those of the leads of the reference ECGs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ECG.	2.324910017712442
For this purpose, those ECGs are searched in an ECG database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ECG.	1.8207424496101576
The function of the method was established with the aid of the ECG signal database CARDIODAT with 249 ECGs for the diagnostic groups: infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of 550 ECGs.	2.0286898726359737
It can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ECG signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts.	2.269246662994586
Purpose: The technical conditions, the optimized scanning protocols and the facilities of virtual endoscopy (VE) are presented in an overview.	1.9563619350430894
During a 4-week ambulatory cardiacc rehabilitation program, 262 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 235 men and 27 women, 53.6+/-10.2 years, performed 30.5+/-2,9 exercise units.	1.9404570088695685
There was a significant (p<0.001) increase in the maximum exercise capacity at the end of the program (105.3+/-32.3 vs. 121.9+/-37.3 W).	2.1857147728232365
Physical work capacity on the 2.0 mmol lactate level improved (p<0.001) from 72.2+/-23.5 to 86.4+/-25.8 W, on the 2.5 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 83.5+/-23.2 to 97.4+/-26.4 W, and on the 3.0 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 93.1+/-23.0 to 106.6+/-26.1 W. Despite enhanced performance, heart rate remained unaltered on the 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mmol/l lactate level.	1.7680505017709087
Furthermore, ergometric performance on predefined heart rate levels was significantly (p<0.001) increased: 85/min: from 56.0+/-24.1 to 65.8+/-24.5 W; 90/min: from 62.0+/-27.3 to 71.2+/-26 W; 95/min: from 67.2+/-26.4 to 77.5+/-27.6 W; 100/min: from 71.1+/-29.6 to 80.6+/-28.1 W; 105/min: from 69.8+/-26.2 to 81.9+/-28.2 W and 110/min: from 73.6+/-28.9 to 90.4+/-29.4 W. The results demonstrate that physical performance in patients with CAD was improved by our novel ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program.	1.7381788506951574
This improvement included an increase in maximum as well as endurance work capacity; furthermore, this increase was accompanied by a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates.	2.4387331140949846
The results demonstrate an absolute increase of physical performance, more importantly an increase of physical performance at defined lactate levels in the presence of unchanged heart rates mediated by the rehabilitation program.	2.1885340782449525
Thus, this increase was independent of motivational factors in the patients and/or the investigators during the re-exercise test.	2.488100040163881
On the contrary, our data demonstrate that it is based on an improvement of aerobic endurance capacity associated with a therapeutically beneficial significant decrease of heart rate for a defined workload.	2.460770667062304
The effects were independent of pharmacological influences (e.g., -receptor antagonists).	2.435632534973977
These findings are of clinical importance with respect to reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with CAD.	3.010855023388029
Newborn screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism are well established in industrialized countries.	2.196037744690884
Missed cases may be not only due to errors in specimen collection and laboratory errors but also to failures in adequate follow up.	1.9644289827708337
We report the case of a now 4-year-old girl whose classical phenylketonuria was diagnostically missed in the course of follow-up procedures of a pathological screening result 1067 µmol/l 17,6 mg% phenylalanine.	2.1808901745518487
The separation of whole blood into components is the state-of-the-art in transfusion of allogeneic blood.	2.187391956986456
The main reasons are the negative effects of the buffy coat and the need for FFP.	2.3274082115731742
Nevertheless, especially in Germany whole blood is being rejected more and more even as autologous blood.	2.4212348692609895
However, most of the negative effects of the buffy coat do not apply to autologous blood.	2.1789543791294723
Additionally, these patients usually do not develop coagulation disorders and therefore do not need plasma as a hemostatic component.	2.0028799980701883
On the other hand, separation into components of autologous blood leads to an increase of costs and to logistic problems that restrict autologous blood predeposit to a few institutions.	2.009101576005724
Therefore, we have reviewed the literature in order to find a scientific basis for this.	2.731878983886989
We analysed all articles listed by MEDLINE during the last 12 years that dealt with the quality of whole blood or red cell concentrates.	2.3528801920259133
In addition, all references were included that contributed relevant information to the topic.	2.0205390270380104
A total of 135 original articles, abstracts, reviews, letters or editorials were analysed that referred to standard preparations and storage media.	1.7108980192943315
In 48 papers the in vivo red cell survival was studied.	2.3556218457307483
28 of which fulfilled the prerequisites to be included into a meta-analysis.	2.379297617066322
The following in vitro parameters were also evaluated: pH, potassium load of the units, ATP and DPG concentration of the red cells.	2.056794860730524
Whole blood (resuspended in CPDA-1) and red cell units (stabilized in CPDA-1 or additive solutions) with a different buffy coat or leucocyte content have comparable pH values and red cell 2,3-DPG and ATP concentrations at the end of the approved storage time.	1.964219895173931
The potassium load of a whole blood unit appears to be higher than red cell concentrates, but this is to some extent caused by the higher plasma content of whole blood and is not thought to be a clinically relevant problem for patients receiving only a few units.	2.4667437203471123
A number of studies demonstrate that dependent upon the leucocyte content of a red cell unit, leucocyte metabolites and enzymes are released and accumulate during storage.	1.7965277317371113
A detrimental influence on the integrity of the red cell membrane was found in several in vitro studies.	2.6935122663893454
Nevertheless, a significant improvement in red cell survival by leucocyte reduction was detected by only one group.	2.32031693627961
Undoubtedly, non-hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions (NHFTR) are generally caused by an antibody-antigen interaction due to the transfusion of allogeneic buffy coat.	2.2154816893935334
On the other hand, there is some evidence that non-specific immunological mechanisms such as the release of histamine or cytokines are also capable of causing NHFTR.	2.2961819367824283
Thus, these reactions are expected to occur in autologous blood transfusion.	2.3109479418380388
However, so far, there are no data about the frequency and severity of these reactions and whether they are more likely to emerge after transfusion of blood units with a particular preparation.	2.4094014821089496
Blood transfusions can cause septic complications due to bacterial contamination of the transfused units.	2.0742806291546616
These fatal but rare complications may be reduced by pre-storage filtration of blood, but there is no indication that buffy coat reduction is effective.	2.2242358626746195
Three cases with septic complications have been reported after autologous transfusion, in two of which red cell concentrates (at least one was free of buffy coat) had been used.	2.295158608603824
Thus, there is no justification for the conclusion that the risk of septic complications is increased by transfusion of whole blood.	2.570902241347613
After all, whole blood and red cell concentrates exhibit only minor differences in relevant in vitro parameters.	2.1800175071345156
Therefore, the 24 h in vivo recovery is considered to be the most valid criterion to assess the quality of red cell preparations.	2.4217189915368
Physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status, mobility, and quality of life.	2.216392796871886
However, the central focus of this contribution is not on illness-specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training.	1.9607412059699196
These two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process.	1.9938479877380921
The spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated.	2.0241121219793157
Even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible.	2.16961601350565
Adequate usage of these training methods contributes to increased competence and a minimization of risks in daily life.	1.9834565477422057
The arthroscopic extraarticular Bankart procedure tries to imitate the open Bankart procedure.	2.1111767203833973
An anterior-inferior transmuscular approach through the subscapular muscle permits to implant self-locking tacks into the anterior inferior third of the glenoid rim.	1.9819354042378359
The extraarticular location of the implants makes a superomedial capsular shift possible, if required.	2.22278054207678
A total of 257 arthroscopic repairs following traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation have been carried out between 1992 and 1996.	1.9220697376659106
177 patients were treated only with bioabsorbable Suretac device.	2.6644727317865247
Clinical and radiological follow up was possible in 165 patients.	2.4383197595899406
According to the Rowe score 69,7 % were classified as excellent, 10,9 % as good, 9,7 % fair and 9,7 % poor.	2.13566885379484
Postoperative complications: the recurrence rate was 9,7 %, allergic reactions representing a foreign body reaction to the synthetic material were seen in 5 cases (3 %) and a frozen shoulder in 6 cases 3,6 %).	2.423173659734487
61 % of the patients involved in overhead or contact sports returned to their preoperative sport activities.	2.52636088963722
Contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography permits comprehensive assessment of the arterial system in the chest, abdomen und lower extremities.	2.28199260983367
The method combines intravenous bolus application of a non-nephrotoxic, paramagnetic, extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3D data set.	2.0452172163358897
High contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues, inherent three-dimensionality and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality.	1.9788260623707654
Contrast-enhanced 3D MRA is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies.	2.069636716812793
This review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest, abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several clincial examples.	1.9821580116217505
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on prosthetic heart valve recipients remain critical.	2.0592440129936502
Some diagnostic questions such as interests in pathologies of the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses, and internal derangements for the knee, strongly recommend the advantages of MRI versus all other radiological diagnostic techniques.	2.014723208579318
MRI can directly affect patients with prosthetic valves in three ways by: 1) movement or dislodgment of the prosthesis, 2) heating, and 3) arrhythmias induced by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the image and its subsequent misinterpretation.	1.8710716171615318
Present literature that concerns the safety considerations of current values appears to be incomplete.	2.261969413728425
Therefore, a survey of twenty-five valve manufacturers with regard to compatibility, safety or contraindication for MRI on their respective prosthetic heart valves was performed in 1998.	2.1918666279776797
Those manufacturers who distribute most of the valves in Europe confirmed the safety of MRI.	2.3917996937186508
However, some gave their assurances based on inadequate data, or assigned all responsibility to the physician.	1.9093115144695483
Some companies did not give any assurance for MRI safety or failed to respond to our enquiry.	1.9859731176082094
Two valve manufacturers warned against performing MRI on certain prostheses.	2.0904351007790742
Based on our 1998 questionnaire, the technical issues, the clinical circumstances, the prerequisites and criteria for and the definition of safety standards for MRI on prosthetic heart valve recipients are presented in this paper.	2.1123178989522366
Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a frequently occurring degenerative illness of the aging human brain.	2.3230474257952456
Histologically, it is possible with the help of suitable staining techniques to identify pathognomonic spindle-shaped cellular inclusions (argyrophilic grains).	2.2370297033527584
These cellular inclusions display a typical cortical as well as subcortical distribution pattern.	2.601609272362198
The goal of the present study is the retrospective evaluation of the clinical findings from 53 individuals with neuropathologically demonstrable AGD-related changes of the brain.	2.631570741133917
Nearly one-half of the cases (49%) was classifiable as demented in accordance with DSM IV-criteria.	2.3551523052601087
Moreover, the frequency of the dementia increased significantly in relation to the growing severity of the AGD-associated pathological cytoskeletal degeneration.	2.2703007439294187
These results confirm the assumption that AGD can cause degenerative changes ranging from cognitive impairment all the way to dementia.	2.0724136506777375
They also underscore the necessity of further prospective studies pertaining to the clinical aspects of this still enigmatic disease.	2.28507480761055
The major problems in the treatment of open fractures with high blood loss are hypothermia acidosis and coagulopathy.	2.5300817488078353
By improving the standards of polytrauma management and using massive transfusion systems, which should help to avoid those complications, the indication for primary limb salvage under hypovolemic shock conditions is greatly increased.	2.005363940652537
The following case of an grade 3 open fracture of the femur with severe soft-tissue damage, including vascular lesions, with consecutive massive transfusion, should demonstrate that the cardiac-respiratory system can still be stabilized, even if a surgical solution seems impossible.	2.1213578546335525
Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is mostly found in middle aged women in skin areas exposed to sunlight.	1.9121136439308033
Our 17-year-old female patient had a widespread reddish-brown lesion on the abdomen that met the histological criteria for annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma.	2.0670367448008284
However, the clinical findings and the localization were uncommon.	2.672507148744848
UV light was excluded as a trigger.	2.603456853254324
Other, still unknown, factors that might change antigenicity of elastic fibres must be considered.	2.152291231551846
Spontaneous resolution suggests a transient influence of such factors.	2.2694585857684944
Differential diagnosis includes skin disorders with elastolysis; discrimination especially from mid-dermal elastolysis is not well defined.	1.9196247911694773
Traumatic instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis.	3.0745135540675554
It is usually treated by different bandaging techniques without the possibility of early functional aftercare.	2.2070332269139157
In the period betweeen 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1998, a total of eight patients with unstable sternoclavicular joints requiring surgical treatment were treated with Balser plates.	2.3037134014812257
The population comprised sevenanterior and one posterior dislocations.	2.1988044665770143
A 81-year-old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea.	2.3571763878921494
Results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right-sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus.	2.2256098145036485
Because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of pulmonology.	2.5399303552497248
The patient died of unappeasable hemoptysis the next day.	2.1869982956193037
At autopsy we found a 2-cm-diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration.	2.4390477951567084
Histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea, which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected.	2.347143129687823
The entity of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a primary tumor of the trachea, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported.	2.5534295617746934
The benefits of epidural analgesia are well known, but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia.	2.2015423065821533
In this study, the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on 172 adult patients in three different operation groups.	2.065248873115713
An epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5-7 days.	2.5808547735745697
There was no difference between the groups with respect to the effectiveness of the analgesia and patients' perception of the treatment.	2.7176716986489837
Mobilization differed, as expected, between the groups, however even after the most major surgery (e. g. cystectomy with bladder substitution), mobilization was impressively unproblematic.	2.0932838522005035
Retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given.	2.1272815352736734
The side effects such as sedation, nausea and pruritis were conditional partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention.	2.0116781234152894
Up to 11 % showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic.	2.5909540083724796
Complications: One patient died of cerebral hypoxy due to an initially undetected subdural catheter placement complicated by severe pre-existent carotid stenosis.	2.04345997233846
In four patients, the epidural analgesia had to be stopped because of catheter migration.	2.6216387941772656
There was no clinical evidence of hematoma, abscess or permanent neurological damage.	2.0454864593228597
Epidural analgesia works well in terms of analgesia, mobilization and patient satisfaction, bearing in mind the potential side effects and complications.	2.307078964879244
It can be recommended for lumbotomy and long transperitoneal operations however not for extraperitoneal interventions in the lower abdomen such as radical prostatectomy.	2.020998863964012
High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) provides excellent contrast between osseous structures, air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution.	2.1712823327073107
Therefore, thin-section HRCT with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures.	2.3584744203867927
The indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma and tumor, the "postoperative middle ear", and malformations.	2.1303574680424378
In most cases, HRCT enables differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor.	1.9941748331754805
The excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells, of osseous defects of the tegmen, of the bony labyrinth, and of the tympanic course of the facial canal.	2.2755348027213675
In addition, HRCT enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles.	2.146969744914062
Although HRCT is the first method of choice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases.	2.6477129922916554
This is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by MRI.	2.3351418567584354
In addition, MRI offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of IV contrast material.	2.2364006026141094
Therefore, MRI may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by HRCT.	2.0970810516192926
The differentiation between a meningocele or meningoencephalocele and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by MRI.	1.9992273242525196
Furthermore, MRI can accurately depict cases of labyrinthitis or of neuritis of the facial nerve or of intracranial disease caused by middle ear processes, while this is not always possible by HRCT.	1.9725521477849475
Morbidity and mortality after emergency procedures in 105 patients with perforated colonic diverticulitis were evaluated in a retrospective study.	2.0975144306019717
In different stages of diverticulitis (Hinchey classification: I, 8.6 %; II, 14.3 %; III, 57.1 %; IV, 20.0 %) mortality was 12.4 %.	1.836345271833809
Preoperative sepsis syndrome with leucopenia and disturbed liver function, cardiac risk factors and obesity were independent prognostic factors in multiple logistic regression.	2.054184727917195
Accompanied by immunosuppression the mortality rate remarkably increased to 33 %.	2.2119950982245005
The stage of peritonitis showed no influence on the prognosis.	2.536117013894362
In multivariate analysis, surgical procedure (primary resection 12.4 %, Hartmann's procedure 61.9 %, non-resection procedures 25.7 %) showed influence only on increased general complications.	1.9042812243917568
The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis is still controversial.	2.2589560000898423
From January 1992 to December 1996, 228 cholecystectomies were performed for acute cholecystitis and a total of 104 patients were operated on conventionally and 124 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery.	2.1222744743949855
In a prospective study we compared the conventional with the laparoscopic technique.	2.2930514107227515
The results indicated that in 19 patients (15.3 %) treated initially with the laparoscopic technique, a switch to laparotomy was required.	2.1103142517385822
The operating duration was lower for conventional cholecystectomy (75 min versus 95 min).	2.013629134816462
However, surgical and nonsurgical complication rates were similar in both groups.	2.260263215358667
The period of hospitalization was shorter in laparoscopic operations.	2.39091162952326
According to these results we believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis is a safe and effective procedure.	2.5713420444138704
The patients will benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic surgery without increased morbidity.	2.466492448146619
The sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is one of the most striking developments in the treatment of melanoma.	2.739101494058339
Since the first report by Morton et al.	2.3757867912500483
in 1992, the method has been refined, and its use has increased.	2.399439420687921
SLND allows precise pathologic staging through removal and analysis of a limited number of nodes (false-negative rate < 2 %).	2.0467086699393
It distinguishes patients with clinically occult nodal disease from those with tumor-free regional basin who would not benefit from radical dissection.	2.078162528991419
However, the SLND is still an experimental procedure with yet unproven utility.	2.0427588082397783
Although children are injured everyday through accidents, road traffic, leisure or sports activities, internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare.	2.2561072021866475
Traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in 76 children up to age 16.	2.4984159454735932
The pattern of injury changed with increasing age, the trauma remaining the same.	2.2460459803169472
Most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).	2.389127422452717
Operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment.	3.2456226284815592
Osseous avulsions of the cruciates and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture.	1.9928619535228418
Suturing of intraligamentous ACL-ruptures as well as patellar ligaments plasty showed unsatisfactory results.	2.405566514842983
Secondary lesions due to instability of the knee where also observed in children.	2.7283237739047244
Children cannot self estimate the severity of the injury so subjective statements are insecure.	2.295233767251626
Trauma, surgery, pain and immobilisation cause a marked malfunction of the senso-motor system which is effectively treated by physiotherapy.	1.969787880701137
Malignant mixed Müllerian tumours (MMMT) are tumours of the female genital tract which rarely occur in extragenital sites.	1.937365653893586
We report a case of a 46-year-old female with MMMT with primary occurrence in the greater omentum.	2.2858421599691194
Only 19 cases of primary extragenital manifestation of this tumour are described in the literature.	2.382029409518225
The clinical appearance, diagnosis, therapy, histological evaluation and histogenesis are discussed.	2.239354502936875
The publication of the CONSORT Statement was aimed at the improvement of the quality of research reports of randomized controlled clinical trials.	2.392709251317542
It contains the most important standards of high quality research.	2.853134175920173
Although originally meant for randomized studies only most aspects of this statement can be applied to other kinds of clinical studies.	2.1913258388924595
The demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher.	2.5920686790595453
In the region of the ankle joint, it is therefore ideal to use the arthroscope for pathology.	2.7825014276733095
Indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are: soft tissue impingement, ligament instability, impingement in the syndesmosis, osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, arthrosis, and loose os trigonum of the talus.	1.8050642740972906
In the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments, loose bodies, and synovitis with soft tissue impingement.	2.252821074278779
A new indication is arthroscopically assisted arthrodesis of the talar and subtalar joint.	2.0730179874372143
The reported high incidence of complications, especially in terms of neurovascular lesions, can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non-invasive distraction of the joint.	3.021868217708453
Although alexithymia is found in patients with various somatic disorders, it remains unclear whether it is really related to organic disease - as proposed by the founders of the concept .[125].	2.330948970906749
Compared to the intense international discussion on the subject, in Germany there are still many doubts concerning alexithymia: while some clinicians question the validity of the whole concept, psychiatric and psychosomatic researchers seem unsure about alexithymia's role in their search for a physiological basis to the link between emotion and physical disease.	1.845520294469851
Our review deals with the empirical literature concerning that possible association and tries to tie in their data with modern, neurobiologically founded insights into emotional information processing within the brain.	1.767519120296748
In the etiopathology of tension type headache, vascular and autonomic disorders are discussed.	2.0503540239985014
Fifteen patients with chronic tension type headache according to the criteria of the IHS were investigated using the TCD-ergometer-test - a method used to evaluate the myogenic mechanism of cerebrovascular autoregulation - and the results were compared with the findings in fifteen healthy control subjects.	2.3305700674362972
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.	2.229774584668539
Following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their precursors with fiber density.	1.8773805497485883
The latter was observed in about 28% of patients already at diagnosis.	2.442554983427352
In a similar way, the frequency of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythroid precursors, implicating an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover, hemoglobin synthesis, and degradation of the expelled nuclei from normoblasts.	1.9631615198305858
The (-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detectable in 30% of pretreatment specimens.	1.9950008940460924
Moreover, significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level, percentages of myelo- and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, and spleen size.	1.8036532515684607
These variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of CML.	2.1937897132992283
Based on our morphometric evaluations, a classification into three different histological subgroups: granulocytic, megakaryocytic, and myelofibrotic was carried out.	1.8624567196897792
This simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data.	2.123313929681391
Sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) revealed a fibrogenic effect of IFN in contrast to a fiber-reducing property of HU.	1.8294947099499843
The dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices.	1.9072499349141114
These included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time.	1.9788845398210946
Thus, in patients with complete hematological remission following IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of CD68+ macrophages, including activated subpopulations.	2.439697364502277
Histological subgroups showed a transition from a (nonfibrotic) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40% of patients.	1.9061205250257878
This change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in 17 patients (36%), but predominantly in those under HU therapy.	2.2032217203317175
In conclusion, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in CML warrants a careful morphological evaluation of trephine biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and, thus, allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process.	1.971255727259862
Computer-aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical computation leads to simplification of this investigation, and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed.	2.3233158251945314
Simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized.	2.471370300619156
In contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the ICP reaches a plateau.	2.412867600891368
Our mathematical method diverges with the description of a pressure-dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models.	2.044961156529482
For that we are able to take the non-linearity of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration.	2.300468625295461
The intrathecal infusion test is a reliable diagnostic method for measuring resistance and compliance in patients suspected of having normal pressure hydrocephalus.	2.1360833212919994
Primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is burdened by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma, especially in conjunction with craniocerebral or thoracic trauma.	2.596506362645591
This also applies to unreamed medullary nailing.	2.299455096906737
Primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure, the timing of which is not predictable.	2.3052395436649116
Plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure, but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation.	2.2439925516786356
In a prospective study conducted from 1 September 1994 to 30 June 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients (average ISS: 30 points), simple femoral stem fractures (A-1 to B-3 of the AO-classification) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique.	1.9103999060659327
While cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone, a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression.	1.9000986624477065
At least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate.	2.1501314020413655
This allows micro-movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue.	2.4123132626365122
All of the fractures were immediately stabilized on the day of the accident.	2.2782643746654125
Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an x-linked disorder of the urea-cycle.	2.180861373048581
With a prevalance of 1:14000 it is one of the most frequent inborn errors of metabolism.	2.182019256251522
Heterozygous females exposed to high protein nutrition or protein catabolism, are faced with highly detrimental effects througout their lives.	1.8582092440782085
Coumarin necrosis is a rare, but life-threatening complication when administering coumarin in oral anticoagulant therapy.	2.334535935909277
Predestined areas are the breasts, hips, gluteal region, thighs or lower legs.	1.9491693712816958
Thrombotic tendencies, such as congenital or acquired changes in coagulation, lead to a higher risk of coumarin necrosis.	2.638909750586446
A direct, toxic effect of coumarin on the capillary system may also play a role.	2.128833730977883
Although the incidence is only 0.01-0.1%, lethality lies at 15%, the knowledge of this rare complication is important in order to begin with a proper treatment punctually.	2.3188459022853087
The therapy of choice is early fibrinolysis.	2.416302484944334
With special emphasis on pediatric aspects, the presently available data on the effectiveness and safety or specific immunotherapy with house dust mite extracts are reviewed.	2.11014719799198
In addition to antiinflammatory treatment and allergen avoidance, specific immunotherapy offers an approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma in those patients sensitized against house dust mites.	2.1503751929413477
Controlled studies of specific immunotherapy against house dust mites show decreased symptom-medication scores and positiv effects on some lung function parameters.	1.816210155088946
Therapeutic efficacy appears to be better in pediatric patients.	2.8915927685062663
Severe side effects seem to be rare, but are more common in patients with chronic airway obstruction, in infants and with rush-immunotherapy.	2.853964297517018
From January 1996 untill February 1997 6,376 patients were treated by our group with PTCA and 3,859 (60.5%) received one or several stents.	1.9938497358801262
An angiographic follow up was achieved in 63% of the patients with 1,267 experiencing restenosis (32.8%).	2.445976250194132
Of those beeing treated with re-PTCA 302 were randomly selected for further analysis.	1.9969434701817834
In-stent-restenosis was treated with rotablator in 8 patients (2.7%), with eximer laser in 21 (7.0%) and with another stent in 48 patients (15.9%).	2.038759872772108
225 patients (74.4%) of this subselection were treated with balloonangioplasty only.	2.4926087226980163
It is not clear whether public health insurance will cover post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), whereby the question of costs being covered by private health insurance companies is not taken into consideration here.	1.9942900376681658
Regulations concerning prevention (§ 20 SGB V), precautionary medical services (§ 23 SGB V) and health examination (§ 25 SBG V) offer no legal basis for cost coverage.	1.9063703033704962
PEP is patient care in the sense of § 27 SGB V. However, this particular treatment has not yet been adapted into public health insurance financial guidelines because the federal committees have not yet made appropriate recommendations.	2.1010292878331067
This should be achieved soon, in order to eliminate legal ambiguities in this area.	2.390671683434874
The principles of the so called "new methods of examination and treatment" legal construct may support cost coverage liability.	2.0677265560763503
On the whole, however, German-Austrian recommendations concerning indication and use of PEP must be formulated more concretely and unambiguously.	2.165688526622232
If a doctor, in the case of an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, does not prescribe PEP, this would probably not be malpractice, because there are still many scientific questions to be answered.	2.3925200957743296
To clarify the functional mechanism of the Esmarch device in the treatment of sleep apnea, its effect on muscle activity during sleep was studied electromyographically with and without the appliance at the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, the genioglossal muscle, and the masseter muscle in 15 patients with sleep apnea syndrome.	2.305988714427296
During the obstructive apnea the muscles showed significantly lower amplitudes than before the apnea.	2.038855899183437
No significant decrease in the amplitude was observed during the central apnea, but, after the obstructive and central apnea, significantly higher amplitudes were seen than beforehand.	2.108976766973881
The amplitudes rose after the placement of the appliance, and the amplitudes of the genioglossal and lateral pterygoid muscles during obstructive apnea increased significantly after the insertion of the appliance.	2.2289435927211385
The results suggest that the device can activate the masticatory and tongue muscle activity and indicate that the muscles activated with the appliance can prevent obstruction in the oropharynx.	1.9412367460236872
The Esmarch device not only helps avoid obstruction by mandibular protraction, but also affects function by activating the muscles.	2.0235130515902515
The analysis of the delinquency bringing disordered offenders into a hospital order institution reveals a lot of very conscious and well organized behavior during the criminal activity.	1.891259613023318
This must be taken into account in therapy and prognosis.	2.6520439526397444
The prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many industrialised and developing countries and growing to a world-wide medical and socio-economic problem.	1.8987575108135655
In a recent report of the WHO the world-wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority.	2.049517655491143
Inadequate long-term results of weight reduction in children and adolescents and the increasing socio-economic burden to the health systems, as well as the high grade of persistence of obesity aggravate the problem and demand primary prevention efforts.Future directions of primary prevention measures could be the time of onset of obesity, the "early adiposity rebound", intrauterine malnutrition, weight gain during infancy, low energy expenditure in infants, familial adiposity, composition of food and modification of fat intake.	1.9984653042643938
Despite advances in the field of orthopedic surgery, necrosis of the femoral head still remains a serious problem.	2.5556187365587797
Under normal conditions magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) is the gold standard for early diagnosis.	2.660555242457145
Because of magnetic interference, this technique is not applicable in the diagnosis of posttraumatic necrosis with internal fixation, however.	2.4067478069033927
This seems to be an ideal indication for ossovenography: contrast medium is injected into the femoral head under X-ray control and the venous flow is documented.	2.4860762331973985
Furthermore, it is possible to get histological samples from suspicious areas.	2.3547902305511315
Ossovenography was performed in 12 patients and the results were compared with histological samples.	3.4225097414597716
In every patient in whom necrosis of the femoral head was diagnosed by ossovenography (91.6 %), we also found necrosis on histological examination.	2.2150535263098603
In one patient in whom physiological flow was found, there was a corresponding absence of necrosis in the histological sample.	2.223414625269417
There were no complications during ossovenography.	2.3269619762470892
The results suggest that ossovenography is a promising and reliable method for early diagnosis of necrosis of the femoral head in the presence of internal fixation devices.	2.5383717954611797
To evaluate patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death the analysis of ventricular late potentials, heart rate variability and baroreflexsensitivity is helpful.	2.4936684818740456
However, the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy.	2.247689880458674
For a better identification of high risk patients other methods are necessary.	2.432902228265018
In this study the impact of the chemoreflexsensitivity for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated.	2.3427908517134286
The results of a retrospective study concerning percutaneous catheter drainage of 62 intra-abdominal abscesses in 60 patients were demonstrated, including the procedure and complications.	2.2897164935057224
For the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control.	2.0841882980526276
We placed a pigtail or van Sonnenberg catheter by Seldinger or trocar technique into the abscesses.	1.8166657304638558
The primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was 85 %.	2.4631543922258543
Complications occurred in 6.4 % of the cases with a mortality of 0 %.	2.822397027136396
This method is an acceptable alternative to surgery for many patients.	2.206022770364762
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses, especially in the critically ill patient.	2.428099217112259
Acute brain tissue damage or systemic illnesses can lead to local or diffuse brain edema and raised intracranial pressure (ICP).	2.1410802663565875
It is obvious that in all brain injuries additional factors (metabolic disturbances, hypoxia and hypercapnia, circulatory instability) aggravating brain edema and impairing recovery of viable neurons have to be treated immediately and consequently.	1.8953068646574724
Medical therapies for further treatment of elevated ICP depend not only on their mode of action and side effects but although on the specific illness.	2.2797914997369433
The different etiology and pathogenesis of developing brain edema and ICP elevation with either more local or generalized extension explain the different success of medical treatment strategies in severe head trauma compared to middle cerebral artery territory or complete hemispheric infarction.	1.943222305931712
An algorithm for treatment of postischemic brain edema in acute hemispheric infarction was developed.	2.2852005033923253
In an investigation of infection control methods for respirator systems in 89 randomly selected German intensive care units as a part of the NIDEP study (Nosocomial Infections in Germany - Surveillance and Prevention), it was found that respirator systems were exchanged daily in about 50% of the intensive care units.	2.1252093354936776
However, Craven et al.	2.323703484404201
On the basis of these results and recent studies, the current situation in the literature was analyzed in order to make recommendations for exchanging ventilator circuits.	2.6000923994771186
The key function of the uterine cervix to maintain pregnancy is biochemically characterized by an increased synthesis of proteins (e.g., collagen), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin) as well as by well-defined interactions between these components of the extracellular matrix.	2.2166292855178793
In contrast to the slow phase of the cervical ripening process in late pregnancy, dilatation of the cervix during parturition requires the rapid formation and action of catabolic enzyme systems, leading mainly to collagen degradation and changes in its architecture but also to degradation of other fundamental matrix proteins.	1.89629960256414
It has been suggested that an increased production of tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1, for example, induces an increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules with subsequent extravasation of granulocytes in the cervical stroma and that the chemotaxis and degranulation of these cells within the stroma is triggered by an increase in interleukin-8 concentration.	2.0223463380063884
The proteases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-8) released after degranulation of neutrophilic granulocytes encounter an already destabilized (loss of decorin) collagenous fiber network.	1.8447429978127465
The clinical consequences of this basic research is to develop new concepts in a more causal treatment of cervical pathology during pregnancy and parturition.	2.1080261462064662
Objectives: The involvement of cytokines in degeneration and inflammation of human tissue is well established.	2.209264138476051
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major agent in the pathophysiology of periarticular bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoporosis.	2.747768665362593
Because the use of recombinant cytokines and growth factors is limited due to their short half lives, techniques are needed to get a permanent release of these therapeutic proteins.	2.304714347244336
The rational of this study was to show that retroviral transduction of human osteoblastic cells is possible in vitro using the marker gene LacZ and the potentially therapeutic gene encoding for human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra).	2.0562293005216294
Different transduction techniques were combined to improve the rate of transduction in vitro.	2.778925037616154
Methods: Osteoblastic cells were isolated from human spongious bone and cultured in vitro.	2.142025906824032
The -galactosidase (LacZ) gene and the cDNA of IL-1Ra were introduced into the isolated cells by retrovirus mediated gene transfer.	2.0679616394037903
LacZ activity was determined by Xgal staining, IL-1Ra was measured quantitatively by ELISA.	2.344571167751757
Results: The transfer of retroviral IL-1Ra led to IL-1Ra expression of 8614 to 10089pg IRAP/50000 cells/48h.	1.8916576500477675
By combining different techniques to improve transduction, the X-gal staining established a rate of transduction of 60%.	2.114696522707207
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that retroviral transduction of human osteobalstic cells is possible in vitro, and leads to high levels of the synthesized transgene product.	2.1400337113973937
The rate of retroviral transduction can be accelerated in vitro.	2.1632311484598317
To provide a brief review of the current state of topical treatment with capsaicin or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for therapy of chronic pain syndromes.	2.2646282027689124
We report a 72-year-old patient who developed an isolated bilateral hypoglossal nerve paralysis following head trauma with complete recovery after three months.	2.1163668277891157
Since the CT scan did not show any fractures of the posterior skull base, we discuss a traction nerve injury as a possible mechanism.	2.442675272508035
Injuries of the colon and retroperitoneum are rarely observed after blunt abdominal trauma and occur in about 5 - 20 % of the patients.	2.3134917607844163
The majority of complications are due to initial misdiagnoses and a delay in treatment.	2.1607448794583126
Lesions of the pancreas and duodenum are the most frequent diagnoses in the retroperitoneal space, while major vascular traumata or urogenital injuries are rare.	2.214521090730726
Retroperitoneal hematoma are most likely due to pelvic fractures.	2.4835645748799253
The survival of patients after colon or retroperitoneal injuries depends on the severity of concomitant organ trauma, the time of diagnosis, and a situation-adapted therapeutic strategy.	2.572061319950978
The treatment of the typical caudal retroperitoneal hematoma following pelvic fractures is conservative in most patients.	2.1911938644480404
Early pelvic stabilization, e. g., with external fixation, is recommended in these patients.	2.472256272846933
Central retroperitoneal hematoma in the supra - or inframesocolic space should be treated surgically, as major vascular injuries are most likely in these patients.	2.1194377872354897
Duodenal or pancreatic injuries need surgical exploration in the majority of patients; the therapeutic spectrum ranges from simple sutures to pancreatoduodenal resection.	2.1350011998359655
The treatment of colon injuries depends on the degree of peritonitis and the severity of concomitant trauma.	2.4532379692470934
Early diagnosed injuries are suitable for primary repair, while deviation stomata or a Hartmann procedure with or without resection should be offered to patients with delayed diagnoses, peritonitis, or severe concomitant diseases.	2.059248297677597
Long-lasting procedures should be abandoned in the emergency situation; in these severe cases, laparotomy should be aimed towards primary "damage control" and followed by definite surgery after stabilization of the patient.	2.004480817743348
Surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries, often involving the femoral vein.	2.4118908237260417
Because of the famous case presented by Roux in 1813, the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable, but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to ligate the femoral artery.	1.7813715606090843
Zaufal's principle (1880) consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes.	2.2345592942997397
This surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever.	2.770855066287217
In the limb, the congestion induced in the vein had a positve effect on the healing process.	2.1465220811169785
The surgical treatment of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis was initially (1931) aimed at achieving decompression in compartment syndromas.	2.0385388061316116
The first thrombectomy was performed in 1937, but several operations with a successful outcome were reported at the 61st annual meeting of the German Society of Surgery in the following year.	2.2836194921881385
Bilateral glomus jugulare tumors are rare.	2.591989723520252
However, their treatment should preserve not only the function of the facial nerve but also the caudal cranial nerves and the middle ears in order to avoid bilateral hearing losses.	2.278412833022186
Further, venous cerebral drainage has to be ensured in order to avoid cerebral hypertension and hemorrhagic infarction after bilateral jugular ligations.	2.273624672806669
In the case presented bilateral glomus jugulare tumors required super-selective angiography and embolization.	1.90547966176197
Complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid-transcervical approach without any further functional deteriorations.	1.9713790577126278
Middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus.	2.233674508720697
As the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery, venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein.	1.9620887465095838
A sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side.	2.1229149355628505
Intoxication-like conditions may also occur without taking drugs.	2.401014570652082
We then use the term "ecstasy".	2.4299114437178178
Intoxication can follow typical or atypical course.	2.304952329054928
The main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood, affect, drive and initiative, train of thought and self-control.	1.8631368522547365
The diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course, occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication.	2.02163644441909
In a meta-analysis of 69 prospective and retrospective studies, we investigated the value of various surgical techniques in the treatment of lumbar disk herniations.	2.6078370447544468
Androgenetic hair loss is the most frequent reason for the topical application of hair-growth-promoting agents.	2.5325615128019527
Such preparations should arrest or even reverse androgen-induced hair follicle regression as well as prolonging the hair cycles, especially of the shortened anagen phase, and thus protect from increased hair loss.	2.0848573379177284
True evidence of drug effects on hair growth is problematic, since trichograms, the method chiefly applied by the manufacturers, fail to reveal every factor involved in the follicular activity, especially the duration of anagen stage.	2.125302765217068
For example, an increase in the anagen rate does not always reflect a lengthening of the anagen stage, but may also be due to shortened hair cycles.	2.3262389065821214
Accordingly, drug effects on hair growth should be investigated by methods that analyse the cell cycle kinetics.	2.091558032889882
For this approach DNA-flowcytometry of the outer root sheath in plucked anagen hairs and of complete anagen hair bulbs taken by micropreparative techniques from scalp biopsies offers a reproducible method for quick and reliable evaluation of hair growth.	1.667533345550798
The calcaneus pseudathrosis is rarly seen in clinical workday and we coundnit find any case be reported.	1.9046678843736444
The authors point especially at anatomical characteristics and biomechanical reasons and their meaning for aetiology of pseudathrosis after a calcaneus fracture.	1.8175425666866099
A general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given.	3.0226152968806472
The remission rate for untreated primary tumors is nearly 100%, for completely treated local relapses approximately 70%.	2.024774500767409
The complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well-tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone.	1.974887717899142
However, thromboembolism of the vertebral artery facing the internal mammary artery may occur.	2.2252223466026813
The indication for intraarterial chemotherapy should always be set by an interdisciplinary board.	2.1567996609699405
In the country city of Ansbach, Germany all cases of varicella-zoster virus infection seen by dermatologists, pediatricians and general practitioneers were registered over a period of 16 months, from February 1992 until May 1993.	1.8253283217489737
152 patients were clinically diagnosed with herpes zoster and 437 patients with chickenpox.	2.1386885743241892
The population-based incidence of zoster infections was 22.6 per 10,000 inhabitants per year, while the incidence of chickenpox was 42.4.	2.3126449734559875
There was a slight predominance of male patients with zoster.	2.2477783401503255
There was also a marked influence of age and sex, on the localization of the involved nerve segments.	2.4203104530072084
Zoster was seen in patients of all ages but there was a clear predominance in older patients.	2.7651495070416257
The peak of the disease occurred in the eighth decade.	2.943484301188951
In patients with chickenpox, the sex ratio was equal.	2.1773919009524887
The disease typically occurs in children and we observed a predominance of the cases in the first decade.	2.8480845045146235
Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS) are rare disorders of the nervous system that cannot be ascribed to metatastases or to destruction of vital systemic organs by the tumor or its treatment.	2.0153044529678508
Most frequently, PNS occur in association with small-cell lung, breast or ovarian carcinomas.	2.136939233316537
The most frequent PNS is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which at the same time has the highest predictive value concerning an underlying carcinoma.	1.9435385262377651
PNS have been classified mostly under anatomical aspects but now are increasingly categorized according to specific antibodies.	2.0182237982635343
In certain neurologic syndromes (sensible and autonomic neuropathy, cerebellitis, limbic encephalitis, Opsoclonus-Myoclonus syndrome, Stiff-man syndrome, neuromyotonia, subacute amaurosis) specific autoantibodies are highly predictive for a neoplasm.	1.696856203854253
Pathogenic relevance of these autoantibodies has been demonstrated only for antibodies against (1) voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, (2) voltage gated potassium channels (VGKC) in neuromyotonia, and (3) recoverin in cancer associated retinopathy.	2.0167888910836616
The present article deals with the neurological symptoms of PNS, associated tumors, and the relevance of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of PNS.	2.6282354819526357
Ewing's sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has, however, attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy.	2.2243167357953313
Its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time, including a possible origin in immature reticulum, myogenous, endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.	2.0935095667467642
Repeated reports have also suggested a possible neuroectodermal genesis.	2.3045907950487385
Convincing arguments, however, have only been brought forward during recent years, since it was found that Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11;22.	2.1948804067912326
In the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses.	1.9864577961553893
There seems to be no clear border between Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation.	2.1704735181337957
Histological differential diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma has been improved by immunohistological methods.	2.454803311503145
In most cases, they can be distinguished from lymphoma (leucocyte common antigen, B and T markers) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (muscle specific actin, desmin) without problems.	1.9085970300774977
Apart from that, it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the MIC 2-protein, which is preferably expressed in Ewing sarcoma.	2.4318245491026254
The diagnostics of Ewing's sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t(11;22) can be proved molecular biologically.	2.066142435912355
Contrast enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance angiography affords angiographic depiction of extended vascular territories with high quality and diagnostic value.	1.9083133528968728
A prerequisite is the fast acquisition of a three-dimensional gradient-echo data set during the injection of a bolus of a T1-shortening contrast agent.	2.0692887629123096
The present study gives a survey of radiological findings after surgical treatment of laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas, whereby the surgical procedures and the localisation of tumours found special consideration.	2.1757754007055814
Owing to advances in adjuvant therapy, the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades.	2.350921093364492
This applies both to improved survival and to increased limb salvage rates.	2.1906772021053857
The diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined.	2.287232337048504
Technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures, such as Tikhoff-Linberg resection at the shoulder, internal hemipelvectomy, proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented.	2.107650635830995
The use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures.	2.278210996958511
In the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk-adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery.	2.280504297295191
In treatment of recurrent tumor in the thoracic wall, axillary or supraclavicular disease surgery plays a major role.	2.2913203438247645
Since - another long-lasting courses occur even in the metastatic situation, recurrence is not an infrequent event, and therapy then needs a multidisciplinary approach.	2.120033545209943
Surgical techniques such as local, myocutaneous or omental flaps and mesh graft transplantation are used to cover large defects after tumor resection.	2.0426195662214113
Additional and innovative modalities are combined in the management of this complex problem: locoregional or systemic chemotherapy, topical application of chemotherapy, certain radiation regimens and in otherwise resistant tumors the experimental use of photodynamic laser therapy (PDT).	1.9451544854664402
The most important goal hereby is to restore or at least maintain organ function and quality of life.	2.0966389747084313
In acute osteomyelitis of childhood a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to prevent late sequelae.	2.3749986281470297
Thus, diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role.	2.3783497848384445
If acute osteomyelitis is suspected in a child, imaging starts with conventional radiography in order to exclude other differential diagnoses.	2.243736301791776
This is followed by sonography for the purpose of diagnosing a subperiosteal abscess or joint fluid from which the causative organism could be isolated.	1.914789389270095
If the diagnosis is unclear, the next step should be either MRI or 99m Tc-MDP bone scan, depending on the possibility of clinical localization and the site of the suspected lesion.	2.1825568517475777
MRI is superior to bone scan in depicting the exact anatomy, which is extremely important in spinal osteomyelitis and preoperatively.	2.334823960177533
The bone scan can show the whole skeleton in one examination and should be favored if there is no definite localization or in suspected multifocal osteomyelitis.	2.1381810848262277
Rarely scintigraphy with labeled white blood cells is indicated.	2.27426614380355
The 67 Ga scan, however, should not be used in children because of the high level of radiation exposure.	3.235808708281939
The different imaging modalities are described in detail and an imaging diagnostic workup is outlined.	2.3057682185763757
In spite of all interdisciplinary efforts and functionally oriented operation procedures, there are still unsatisfying results in the treatment of cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients.	2.2787699898723277
Secondary corrections involve upper lip, nose, and palate (fissures).	2.0289288379853456
In some cases, it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla.	2.602814971383025
Finally, there are indications for speech improving measures and total septorhinoplasties.	2.4693703727799483
Dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant-borne prosthodontic work.	2.5511532016898486
In this paper, some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described, which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary CLP care.	2.372521918949651
Damage to the respiratory system caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion and the subsequent development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main lethal factors in burns patients.	2.026242929227366
Treatment with exogenous surfactant is one of the therapeutic options.	2.9941445996941924
However, no clinical reports have yet been published about this therapy.	2.1816322831340456
We report on two patients with burn injuries of second to third degree affecting 42% and 48% respectively of the total body surface plus inhalation injury complicated by ARDS.	1.7681978279635593
Both patients were treated with bovine surfactant (Alveofact).	2.5750505387828437
The therapeutic effects on oxygenation and pulmonary function were monitored.	2.2859232744567914
Intrabronchial application of surfactant by bronchoscopy during exhaustive conventional mechanical ventilation resulted in improved gas exchange with an increase in arterial O2 pressure (paO2); inspired O2 concentration (FiO2) was lowered and there was an improvement in lung compliance.	1.9565897328240414
Both patients survived this critical situation.	2.3699926628535244
We conclude that treatment with exogenous surfactant in postburn victims with ARDS is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the survival rate of these high-risk patients.	2.273710694189149
The main aesthetic concern of patients with Angle class II deformities with skeletal deep bite - short face syndrome - is the short lower face.	2.0540533714029268
It is the orthodontist's task to correct this deformity insofar as possible.	1.9645039242556135
Since presurgical orthodontic treatment determines the kind and extent of the surgical procedure, the orthodontist has to plan the treatment in for individual case .	2.3077128124848736
It is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a concept of treatment for patients with class II deformities, skeletal deep bite, and a short lower face.	2.576145600688525
Presurgical orthodontic treatment and the surgical procedure to correct the deformity are discussed.	2.7688638691744765
The treatment results show that it is necessary to leave or to create a certain curve of Spee, depending on the extent of the deformity, to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of to function, aesthetics, and stability.	2.40264823448818
It can be concluded that it is only possible to reach the preset treatment goals with an exact diagnosis and the knowledge of the necessary preparation in combination with the surgical procedure.	2.653360959138541
Adequate psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexual patients during the "real- life-test" is crucial for the outcome after sex reassignement surgery.	2.1728060371566205
Usually therapeuts of transsexual patients, who decide over somatic sex reassignement, have to engage also in psychotherapy in a broad sense.	2.103362296938433
Within the setting of the "administrative-psychotherapeutic split" the psychotherapist leaves the decision over admission to sex reassignement to a therapist specialised in gender identity disorders.	1.756921387364873
During recent years in the German federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms.	2.0694792596704343
The hospital sector - as an element of this system - has also been affected.	2.1863251845805203
Based on various legislation the financial framework has been reduced which has led to tendencies of economic limitation and rationalization.	1.981012085366317
From this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result.	2.262883022415204
Cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and dicharged to outpatient services despite unknown domestic follow-up care.	2.461043905084217
Mostly the elderly are affected.	2.7462790183597856
Medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between SGB V and SGB XI.	2.2682156979689108
However, this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit payment (rehabilitation before nursing, priority of home, etc.).	1.7348769385631033
Right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors.	2.4483499052166198
Various medical, nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation.	2.282558734242898
In 1995 the Ethics Commission of the Medical University of Lübeck was asked to rule on whether a preimplantation diagnostic procedure (PID) could be performed on a husband and wife who were both carriers of the cystic fibrosis mutation  F508.	1.8288738231803665
The couple had previously given birth to a child with cystic fibrosis and had twice terminated a pregnancy following prenatal screening.	1.9196197588041162
Ethically, the performance of a PID was certainly warranted for this couple.	2.247979784705267
The risk of violating §§8 Section 1 and/or 2 Section 1 ("totipotent cells shall not be removed for diagnostic purposes") of the Law for the Protection of Embryos (ESchG) was judged to be nonexistent in written statements from two expert witnesses (Prof. K.V.	1.8257681043713243
Hinrichsen and Prof. H.M. Beier, both embryologists).	2.0477900093329575
In the view of the Ethics Commission, only §1 Section 2 ("an ovum shall be fertilized only for the purpose of inducing pregnancy") of the ESchG currently prohibits PIDs.	2.1354910760048154
In light of the social and biological arguments in favor of PIDs, however, the Ethics Commission questioned whether this section of the ESchG is still morally justifiable.	2.2123863177575473
A 38 year old male patient with a coarctation of the aorta was successfully operated using an ascending aorta-abdominal aorta bypass (AAAAB).	2.1338341861914425
The diagnosis of a severe postisthmic stenosis had been confirmed by aortography.	2.224813791823037
Preoperatively the patient suffered from extreme hypertension and claudicatio intermittens.	2.415396827712104
After prosthetic repair of coarctation, blood pressure became normotensive and claudicatio intermittens disappeared.	2.149122286049196
In this report, we discuss various surgical techniques and the most important question concerning the optimal timing of surgical repair of aortic coarctation.	2.471477642762239
Iatrogenic colonic perforation is a rare but very dangerous complication of colonoscopy.	2.44977057999917
We report on eleven prospectivly recorded patients treated between 1994 and 1998.	2.1023461493408484
In seven cases the colonoscopy had been done for diagnostic and in four cases for therapeutic reason.	2.1252336074476053
Nine women and two men (age range 56 to 92 years) were affected.	2.326063118853661
In 77 % the perforation was found in the sigmoid colon.	2.639389804624823
All patients were operated on and five sutures, five resections and one colostomy were performed.	2.078854836982221
No significant differences could be shown in six patients with classical perforation compared with five patients presenting with prolonged abdominal pain.	2.3231645866625596
Only duration of symptoms was significantly different in the two groups.	2.4298888482699956
Three patients (85, 90 and 92 years) died from late complications.	2.136070019743759
Indications of MR arthrography were analyzed in this prospective study.	2.550977883700303
The aim was to evaluate possible advantages over conventional MRI, establish diagnostic criteria and to analyze its meaning further for the therapeutic management of postoperative patients.	2.2316420113586384
Nerve fibre-neuroendocrine cell complexes (NF-NEC-C's) are neuroendocrine cells located in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract directly connected with nerve fibres of Meissner's plexus.	1.8468024810190395
We report on a patient with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with electron microscopically demonstrated multiple NF-NEC-C's in non-antral gastric mucosa.	1.7431954359128001
It is suspected that in ZES the hypergastrinaemia may represent a trophic stimulus for the proliferation of NF-NEC-C's in the gastric mucosa.	1.8392134332615273
Introduction: The prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation, is especially in multi-system-trauma cases, recognized to be the "gold standard".	2.23540680546008
Thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general, the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation, is becoming of increasing importance.	2.464068396044821
Thereby we must take into consideration the limited possabilities, which are afflicted with a high degree of uncertainess, which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation.	2.2018951360049615
The purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients, was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings, to identify areas for procedural optimization.	2.1833580055964155
Staging of any tumor, i.e.	2.33925893776374
determination of the extent of the disease, serves to select the patients who might profit from curative surgical intervention or to define those patients with inoperable carcinomas who should be referred for other therapies, such as chemotherapy or irradiation.	2.3948314131167128
Furthermore, accurate staging is necessary for assessment of prognosis, for radiation therapy planning, and for differentiation of those with small-cell lung cancer or for follow-up examinations of small-cell lung cancer patients after during and after chemotherapy.	2.3263119304805078
The primary radiological staging and diagnostic modalities for assessment of bronchial carcinomas are computed tomography (CT) of the thorax including liver and adrenal glands, abdominal sonography, and bone scintigraphy.	2.1421152264372147
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for specific indications, e.g.	2.0781081647718707
infiltration of the chest wall or staging of patients with intolerance/allergy to intravenous contrast medium.	2.7491050264608554
The clinical value of nuclear medicine techniques, such as [18F]2-fluoride-2-desoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for evaluation of lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111 octreotide/somatostatin receptor scans for staging of small-cell lung cancer, and thallium-201 SPECT are currently being assessed in numerous studies, although these techniques are already in routine use.	2.079929374685941
In future these or nuclear medicine techniques, as well as techniques using molecular-based contrast material, especially for MR imaging, currently in experimental status, may yield serious potential for staging purposes.	2.120774416845648
Background: We investigated fundus autofluorescence in vivo using a novel scanning laser ophthalmoscope.	2.0419726574517503
Myocardial infarctions may be precipitated by external triggers.	2.2518062768173976
External triggers include physical activity and emotional stress as well as other infrequent triggers such as war threats or earthquakes.	2.17302044276331
Changes in the environment also play an important role in the incidence of myocardial infarctions; circadian, seasonal, and weekly variations have been observed.	2.176442623346692
Patients' behavior at the onset of symptoms depends on various factors and influences outcome and mortality.	2.2473384352515002
Health education should be directed towards patients' behavior and promptly seeking medical assistance at the onset of symptoms.	2.0440041903305675
Introduction: In patients with neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors and liver metastases, but without known extrahepatic manifestations, liver transplantation may be indicated as curativ or "long-term-palliativ" therapy.	2.277429689776092
For these patients the absence of bone lesions is mandatory.	2.622943202359216
A patient suffering from long-standing pustular psoriasis of the palms was treated for 3 weeks with a mercury-containing drug.	2.1375080666703576
Exacerbation into generalized pustular psoriasis developed.	2.4055936408917873
Mercury levels in blood and urine were increased.	2.4806897710621727
After withdrawal of the mercury preparation, therapy with DMPA (2,3-Dimercapto-1-propane-sulfonic acid), a mercury antidote, was initiated, together with short-term treatment with aromatic retinoids and PUVA.	2.1454305361389876
Within a few days mercury levels decreased significantly and the skin lesions practically disappeared.	2.319504118002526
Chromosomal analysis from peripheral blood cultures is a routine procedure while the analysis of meiotic chromosomes is labor intensive and mainly used in a scientific setting.	2.04695993877396
Of all infertile males, 7-9% show numerical and/or structural chromosomal abnormalities in their peripheral blood lymphocytes.	2.1844206180283163
There is an inverse correlation between sperm count and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, with 21% of patients with non-obstructive azoospermia having a chromosomal abnormality, most often Klinefelter's syndrome.	2.1796494132909294
The rate of patients with chromosomal abnormalities is only 9% in patients with severe oligozoospermia (less than 5 million/ml), and structural abnormalities are found more often in this group.	2.8075822131703307
Using fluorescence in situ analysis the number of selected chromosomes can be assayed in single sperm cells.	2.179457248672273
There is no consensus on whether infertile men have a higher proportion of aneuploid (disomic) sperm cells than fertile men.	1.85865142467246
Taking into account the results from meiotic studies in infertile men, an increased rate of aneuploid sperm cells is likely.	2.0166355933293634
Chromosomal analysis should be performed on all infertile men being treated with ICSI as the result of this analysis could have important consequences in their reproductive decisions.	2.2408811351427413
Background: Tufted angioma represents a benign vascular lesion of the skin.	2.550878091800026
The knowledge of this distinctive entity is important in distinction of clinically more aggressive and malignant neoplasms respectively.	2.0235595427642536
In most cases external fixation is used.	2.460852713260682
Gain of leg length up to 15 cm and more is possible in the lower leg and the femur and 8.5 cm in the humerus.	2.29121689893501
Limb lengthening is useful in many cases of dwarfism due to skeletal dysplasia.	2.27811990118788
We report the results of 48 patients with dwarfism operated on in the Orthopädische Kinderklinik Aschau (Orthopaedic Hospital for Children).	2.020636916658895
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, prizing, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapy.	1.4915644685734217
A research-informed treatment (Grawe 1997), its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	1.7232813545359422
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by a specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	1.5672051953376127
Malnutrition is a common finding amongst our elders.	2.715035256821507
The causes of malnutrition are multifactorial and although they have been extensively studied, they are not entirely understood.	2.1568160692824
Both physiological and pathological processes of aging put this population at a higher risk of being undernourished.	2.1280842244572304
These may be related to social, financial, psychological and/or physiological changes directly or indirectly associated to growing old.	2.2493234073250368
We report on a 76-year-old female patient with clinical findings consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema.	2.11781501242397
Plasma glucagon levels were slightly elevated, but advanced radiologic techniques revealed no evidence of an underlying pancreatic tumour.	2.0649958260156445
The dermatosis responded excellently to oral therapy with dapsone.	2.251350195729718
The possible aetiology and pathogenesis of the "pseudoglucagonoma syndrome" are discussed.	2.272916712112187
Complications during cataract surgery such as dropped nucleus or lens fragment dislocation into the vitreous cavity may become sight threatening.	1.8411796303804144
The recommendations regarding possible therapeutic approaches are inconsistent.	2.454623199495674
Several factors like uveitis and/or an increased intraocular pressure play a major role in the decision on the further surgical procedure.	2.473045542010012
Recent publications recommend an early pars plana approach in order to avoid any traction at the peripheral retina during manipulations via a limbal approach.	2.013264430841159
The authors describe the histopathology of the resting cartilage and the growth plate in a case of diastrophic dysplasia and review the differential diagnosis with pseudodiastrophic dysplasia and atelosteogenesis type II.	2.0851537780617386
Objective: Hypoplastic left heart (HLH) is a complex developmental malformation of the left ventricle, aorta, and associated valves.	2.4480758480946436
Survival beyond neonatal period is the exception in untreated infants.	2.208320160368189
The prognosis, however, is no longer hopeless.	3.092284203829901
Clinical stabilization of a neonate with HLH is appropriate until a management decision, based on appropriate parental counselling, can be made.	2.165240384835083
Forty-one patients demonstrating clinical symptoms for cerebral infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI).	1.9972664771150241
In 8 patients only DWI showed the cerebral lesions clearly.	2.150529782261506
One patient with positive DWI and T2WI suffered from HSV encephalitis.	2.0160869808484643
DWI is superior to T2WI in assessment of small cortical infarcts and cerebral infarction in patients with preexisting vascular lesions.	2.423443912699765
DWI is not specific, so other causes like cerebral hematoma and encephalitis have to be considered.	2.0949046948898937
Juvenile polyposis was first described by Cronkhite and Canada in 1955.	2.303397821605277
This disease is characterized by juvenile intestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities.	2.422402604193357
The etiology of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS), however, is still not well understood.	2.3368797548080673
Interestingly, among patients with CCS a significant correlation (16.5 %) with intestinal carcinomas has been observed.	2.0496766768211354
Thus, malignant transformation and/or genetic predisposition may be involved in the initiation of the disease.	2.7898067898956627
In the following, epidemiology, symptoms, morphology and therapy of CCS are discussed.	2.1317206744973496
Our examinations are based on studies reported in the literature and on a case report of a female patient who developed a colon carcinoma 2 years after initial diagnosis of CCS.	2.7387561050847005
Pacemaker erythema is a rare, irreversible side effect of cardiac pacemakers, clinically characterized by epifocal teleangiectatic erythema.	2.373850721239578
Histology reveals teleangiectatic vessels in the superficial dermis and a slight perivascular infiltrate.	2.1650889508759645
We report on three patients presenting with pacemaker erythema following either pacemaker or defibrillator implantation.	1.9869103870223344
The pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown.	2.120905877143969
In contrast to peri- or postoperative pacemaker infections, physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism.	2.1446530555933148
Allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results.	2.1498989247538622
The present legal requirements for the prescription of controlled drugs remains an impediment to adequate therapy for chronic pain because of an abundance of legal regulations.	1.9639144590212587
The physician prescribing opioids must consider the permitted maximum amount per prescription, the period of time the drug is prescribed for, numerous cross references, and other special regulations, and he still cannot be sure that he does not violate certain legal requirements.	1.7876952131500308
Often these difficulties result in withholding necessary pain treatment!	2.2703200518984095
In the authors' opinion it should be sufficient to write a specific prescription form for controlled drugs in the same way as any other ordinary prescription without jeopardizing the safety of the drug control system.	2.0378681706841757
It is important that the use of the narcotic be justified in the sense of § 13 Abs.	2.5238697124580107
1 of the drug control regulation, as judged by the responsible prescriber of the drug, and that any offence be punished.	2.345588207866357
The use of triplicate prescriptions guarantees sufficient proof.	2.095137001541328
Legislation is requested that will substitute for the present drug control regulations, which are difficult to handle.	2.4889739721181723
The aim of the study was to investigate the ability to activate the quadriceps femoris muscle voluntarily in patients after severe knee injuries and it's influence on muscle function.	2.0160114496526775
33 male patients after ACL-rupture with concomitant injuries were investigated with a twitch-interpolation-method to determine the maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and the ability to activate the quadriceps muscle voluntarily.	2.172111370027741
The results were compared to a previously investigated group of patients after isolated ACL-rupture and to an aged-matched control group.	2.268986486638098
The initial effects consisted of a decrease in insurance premiums, a very attractive feature for employers.	2.1975855415626517
Managed care promises to contain expenditures for health care.	2.2440360626357747
Given the shrinking public resources in Germany, managed care seems attractive for the German health system, too.	2.1338697836121336
In this review the development of managed care, the principal elements, forms of organisation and practical tools are outlined.	2.2835646672828456
The regulation of the delivery of care by means of controlling and financial incentives threatens the autonomy of physicians: the physician must act as a "double agent", caring for the interest for the individual patient and being restricted by the contract with the managed care organisation.	1.9642168981083739
Cost containment by managed care was achieved by reducing the fees for physicians and hospitals (and partly by restricting care for patients).	2.0662903691518033
The preeminent role of primary care physicians as gatekeepers of the health network led to a reduced demand for specialist services in general and for university hospitals and anesthesiologists in particular.	2.0422026457568005
The paradigm of managed care, i.e., to guide the patient and the care giver through the health care system in order to achieve cost-effective and high quality care, seems very attractive.	2.4429308305134954
The stress on cost minimization by any means in the daily practice of managed care makes it doubtful if managed care should be an option for the German health system, in particular because there are a number of restrictions on it in German law.	2.1321000734749123
Background: Analysis of the impact of head fractures, intracranial hemorrhages, brain edema, and prognostic risk factors on long-term outcome in children with severe head injury.	2.3883347728591042
Background: In the past, the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect.	2.539694740382804
Since the target tissue is not directly observable, no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon.	2.173439217433734
High inter- and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under- or overdosage.	2.167716557489364
Underdosage is therapeutically useless, while overdosage causes the so-called "popeffects" which may induce severe damage to the eye.	2.191395904102132
In the past, most scientific or routine studies on heart rate variability (HRV) were done using commercial Holter ECG devices with traditional magnetic tapes.	1.8337830899797958
All methods to calculate parameters of HRV are based on the measurement of time intervals between successive sinus cardiac beats, in practice RR intervals.	2.259476519025194
Hence, results of HRV calculation depend on the quality of primary data acquisition.	2.697891751296907
However, technical standards on accuracy of RR interval acquisition in magnetic tape and digital solid state Holter ECG systems do not exist as yet.	1.9579639367423758
Therefore in a laboratory investigation accuracy of HRV parameter calculation after traditional standard tape with and without real-time analysis and digital solid state data acquisition was compared in three commercial Holter ECG systems [Ela medical (E), Oxford Medilog Excel (O) and Medset Cardiolight (M)].	1.7611141450388543
A computer-based ECG simulator was used to synthesize a test signal consisting of artificial P-QRS complexes of fixed rate, quartz stabilized "sinus rhythms".	1.8936679119571078
Two channel analog tape and digital 24h recordings of the fixed rate test signal were performed simultaneously.	1.9932339455264798
The influence of recording technology on accuracy of RR interval measurement and consequently on time domaine HRV was shown by comparing five standard 24-h time domain parameters.	1.764287270033078
As expected, in the three Holter systems the analog tape recordings showed a higher, technically induced, artificial RR variability.	2.2304644026364424
The SDNN values (E: 9.38ms vs 2.68ms; p<0.001; O: 3.89ms vs 0.97ms; p<0.001; M: 10.47ms vs 2.89ms; p=0.001), SDNN-Index values (E: 8.22ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; O: 3.75ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; M: 7.81ms vs 1.49ms, p<0.001) and RMSSD-values (E: 10.39ms vs 2.16ms; p<0.001; O: 10.05ms vs 1.88ms, p<0.001; M: 8.62ms vs 1.69ms; p<0.001) were significantly lower if acquisition was done by digital solid devices in all systems, SDANN (M: 9.83ms vs 5.37ms; p<0.001) in the Medset system too.	1.8602043386166356
The used method is a possible way to validate commercial Holter ECG systems for HRV analysis.	2.173975530704968
Clinical significance of artifical HRV seems to be low.	2.705140248018392
Cases of gallstone ileus (108) were analyzed retrospectively over 30 years.	2.1178021413825734
Even today, when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is done, the incidence of this rare disease remains the same.	2.5468822464503225
History, clinical and X-ray findings are non-specific.	2.8373704114014275
Aerobilia was seen in 17 % of the patients.	3.1642307465862407
Since 1992 sonography has proveded an exact diagnosis in 10 of 15 cases.	2.3875202244428113
In the triad of known gallstone, non-specific epigastric pain with assumed small intestinal obstruction, and impossible detection of a stone in the gallbladder, there is strong suspicion of a gallstone ileus.	2.2087298700382703
The evidence is given if the gallstone is seen in the bowels.	2.3795166561038545
Intraoperatively more than one stone was found in the intestines in 20 %, and cholecystoduodenal fistulas were encountered in 83 %.	2.427869424116451
There has been no significant change in mortality for 30 years.	2.343635855774751
Autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the microtopographic anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of microneurosurgical techniques.	1.9824776432259887
Recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions.	2.382414985065869
However, attempts to restore forearm, hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far.	2.0261474875299803
Therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making, selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and longlasting postoperative management.	1.9132019243195653
Leg venectasia is a common problem.	2.7606062829112616
Although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities, none of them gives satisfactory results.	2.3224510968843455
The effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor.	2.4327981800843244
Electrocoagulation and argon laser treatment often result in scarring.	2.270678661804997
We studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of 585 nm in the treatment of leg venectasia.	2.2163866798462566
After repeated treatments using this laser system, only 30% of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed; we obtained better lightening of smaller red, telangiectatic vessels with a diameter up to 0.4 mm.	1.866114332456188
However, hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment.	2.2881892560015213
In post-treatment biopsies, occlusion of the vessels was found.	2.5358635714057836
Based on these results, we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia.	2.4752497984781967
Larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy, while finer telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	2.307825981127358
Total hip replacement is often recommended for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	2.452601869380592
Hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using a metallic head prosthesis was not successful in the past, because the majority of patients developed protrusio acetabuli after surgery.	2.4562427894131593
In the present study hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head was shown to be a useful method for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	2.24762515519105
From 1985 to 1990 277 patients were treated with hemiarthroplasty.	2.6811074502904684
The average age at the time of accident and operation was 81.7 years.	2.323745413985979
At the time of follow-up in 1993 only 77 survivors were available for examination.	2.5399323872017225
Only three patients had hip pain, and in four cases the roentgenographic examination revealed protrusio acetabuli.	2.4697036892471593
Two of these four patients underwent revision surgery for replacement of the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	2.0227506257232357
In view of the small number of approach-related complications, hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head is the recommended surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	1.994081408862158
In the rare patient with protrusio acetabuli, revision surgery can be performed to replace the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	2.1106289944781733
Functional relaxation (FE), a somato-psychotherapeutic method, can reduce asthmatic symptoms.	2.204767221992088
The efficiency of a 5 minute introduction of elements of functional relaxation (EFE) is compared with a placebo-relaxation-method not based on the hypothetical mechanisms of FE, and a standardised pharmacological bronchodilative test using salbutamol.	2.0792924342409917
Before and ten minutes after therapy the patients had bodyplethysmographic pulmonary function testing.	2.2971460169801845
U-Tests showed that the baseline measurements were comparable.	2.5259403060352628
The before-after-comparison revealed significant changes for EFE and salbutamol, not for the placebo-relaxation.	1.964503096892973
There were significant differences between the intraindividual differences of the airway resistance and the specific airway resistance between salbutamol and the placebo-relaxation, not between EFE and salbutamol or EFE and the placebo-relaxation.	1.941824930133497
FE can be an effective complementary treatment in children or adolescents with asthma.	2.3667374163311914
3D Ultrasound will find in the next years a wide popularity under the medical imaging applications.	2.073469478399149
The method expands the well-known sonography on the third dimension, therefore it becomes possible to generate  spatial 3D views of internal organs.	1.9799733644833541
It is further possible to display static (3D) as well as  dynamic organs (4D, e.g.	2.2006194190965083
The clarity of the three-dimensional presentation supports very effectively the navigation.	2.595317345670501
58 patients following Gustilo IIIB open tibial fractures, treated by serial debridements, osteosynthesis and microvascular free tissue transfer were investigated after an average of 6 years.	2.019236044170554
Assessment of life satisfaction was done by means of a proven valid and reliable test instrument (FLZ - "Fragen zur Lebenszufriedenheit").	2.124453609239893
Further specific questions on treatment satisfaction, aesthetic result, occupation and income were added to this questionnaire.	1.963817278518659
Significant discrepancies of the items recreational activities, income, occupation and partnership, productivity, mobility and pain were evaluated in comparison to available data of healthy west german population.	1.9913870380400323
The calculated global index of life satisfaction and health differed significantly from the established index of west german population.	1.9771663388836487
Although specific aspects like aesthetic result, donor site morbidity, pain and even function were critically judged, 91 % of the patients were satisfied with the long term result of the treatment.	2.476737404018626
None of the patients thought that an initial amputation probably might have been a better solution.	2.379800023543915
The postrehabilitation employment rate was 64 %.	2.4309248296136508
Limb salvage of Gustilo IIIB fractures by means of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol is able to afford useful and satisfying long time results.	2.129604187871379
However, an impairment of quality of life, at least in specific items has to be considered.	2.5044717028040324
The case of a 10-year-old boy with post-traumatic priapism after perineal trauma is presented.	2.501804994477232
Interdisciplinary treatment using angiography and selective catheter embolization for juvenile high-flow priapism is demonstrated.	2.079695433144927
The literature and the diagnostic possibilities resulting from color duplex sonography are discussed.	2.242514917349257
Only 53%-58% of patients with a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAB) following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm survive without neurological damage.	2.2400821640702535
Morbidity and mortality are closely related to the delayed ischaemic neurological deficit due to cerebral vasospasm.	2.2322009944113583
The following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms; the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists, hypervolaemic haemodilution, and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature.	2.1286537279161872
During the last decade an unusual amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis has been described in association with autoimmune disease in sixteen female patients.	2.180153405052481
Histologic features are subcorneal sometimes spongiform neutrophilic pustules.	2.159456384312307
We report an additional patient suffering from this unusual dermatosis.	2.324104661036896
An overview of the patients described to date and a review of the literature are given in an attempt to delineate this amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis from the known pustular dermatoses.	2.256469343624034
The area "Environment and Health" is characterized by interdisciplinary features and, consequently, an intense need for communication.	2.1053745999315963
In addition it has to be considered that sometimes there are difficulties in terms of information search.	2.5618960142380054
A comparison of national problem solving strategies concerning electronic network activities within this area led to the development project for a European information and communication platform.	1.9829823465170975
By this electronic platform the international exchange of experiences, coordination of activities, harmonization efforts and an optimization of qualification possibilities for environmental health professionals will become easier.	1.7323687152396903
Objectives Intertrochanteric adduction osteotomy to delay or prevent the development of a coxofemoral osteoarthritis.	2.4155983066016393
No removal of bony wedge thus avoiding leg shortening.	2.244853150026603
The aim of this study was to analyze the localization and distribution of extracellular matrix in normal and glaucomatous damaged optic discs using immunohistochemical methods.	1.9636369216102587
Five eyes donated for corneal allografting without any history of glaucoma and three other eyes with secondary glaucoma were studied.	1.8619125434186012
Immunohistochemical reactions were performed with antibodies against collagen types I, III, IV and VI and against laminin, proliferating antigen KI 67 and GFAP.	1.9299033877411258
In glaucomatous eyes the characteristic arrangement of collagen fibrils is lacking.	2.115576977094965
Septa of the lamina cribrosa appear enlarged.	2.5107935605716554
The immunoreactivity of all examined collagen types is stronger in glaucomatous eyes.	2.0464945466896904
We postulate that fibroblasts and astrocytes in the stroma of glaucomatous lamina cribrosa could be stimulated to increased and uncontrolled proliferation.	1.8254989615335335
Associated disorganization and raised secretion of extracellular matrix may lead to axon constriction and, secondarily, to neural degeneration.	2.083990629995353
Concomitant pathologies (labral lesions, intra-/extra-osseous ganglia and stress bone marrow edema) in adult residual hip dysplasia (RHD) might influence the outcome of conservative hip surgery.	1.9409159486387804
The aim of our prospective clinical study was to assess the value of preoperative MR arthrography in diagnosing concomitant lesions and in making surgical decisions in RHD.	2.1959563249623124
The first 37 consecutive patients with a minimum follow-up of 18 months have been analysed.	2.9250878308780113
All 37 patients presented RHD with the clinical symptomatology of labral lesions and underwent routine preoperative MRA.	2.1020330205768243
According to clinical, radiological and MR arthrographical criteria, these 37 patients were subdivided into four therapeutic subgroups: (1) reorientation of the acetabulum using the Tönnis triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO); (2) intertrochanteric varisation osteotomy (IVO); (3) palliative decompression with only symptomatic partial resection of the torn labrum (PALL); (4) primary total hip replacement (TEP).	2.04805817655597
Based on the preliminary clinical and radiological outcomes of these four subgroups, the following conclusions can be drawn: labral lesions are considered to be a sign of chronic joint instability.	2.2483038250489122
Therefore, acetabular malorientation should be corrected by redirectional osteotomy of the acetabulum (TPO-subgroup) even in low grades of RHD if labral lesions are present.	1.8828316769033073
"Palliative" labral resections without corrective osteotomy (PALL subgroup) in secondary osteoarthritis due to RHD are definitively obsolete, because they rapidly progress to severe osteoarthritis due to surgically accelerated joint instability.	1.7617326599230019
In RHD with highly osteoarthritic hip joints and concomitant lesions, one should not hesitate to perform primary THR even in young patients.	1.9427679250889613
In this connection, open fractures with defects or significant comminution have a bad prognosis is as far as reconstruction of the talus is concerned.	2.24821725959833
In the Department of Traumatology, Braunschweig, in 1995 three patients (all male, average age 35.3 +/- 10.2 years) were treated with cancellous bone grafting after talectomy performed because of infection and complete septic collapse of the talus.	2.0795663541358946
In two of these cases third-degree open total dislocation of the talus had been sustained.	2.5418038706664077
The third patient came to us after undergoing arthroscopy of the ankle region in another hospital.	2.185384992513646
In each case a fulminating infection was the outcome.	2.2738153453387646
Following a step-by-step algorithm, in a first step urgent radical debridement with talectomy was done.	2.095017529471118
To maintain approximation between the tibia and calcaneus on one side and the os naviculare on the other, the bony defect was filled with PMMA chains and the external fixateur technique was used for immobilization during treatment of the infection.	2.083175806895579
After second- and third-look procedures a free flap was grown for soft tissue coverage within the first 10 days.	2.108884109271247
After 17.6 +/- 3.3 days the talus was replaced with a cancellous bone graft, combined with double arthrodesis in two cases, and external fixation for the next 4-5 weeks.	2.2464546811273904
In the third patient a triple arthrodesis was done.	2.2184575965160738
At follow-up after an average of 12 months (range 8-17 months), the bone graft with arthrodesis had been completely integrated in all cases.	2.773530894387945
In the case of severe open fractures of the talus with significant comminution combined with infection and septic bone collapse conservation of the talus is often impossible.	2.280451276896748
The combination of homologous cancellous bone grafting and arthrodesis after talectomy is therefore a good method of keeping any decrease in the function of the foot to a minimum.	2.154948157282468
Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a 63 year old female in Austria.	2.48293456126365
Sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia, disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment.	1.989809298589714
Being a farmer, the patient belongs to a recognized high-risk-group, as most other infected people do.	2.437527314050541
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a human infection by Streptococcus suis in Austria so far.	2.1654991524205385
The results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis, and thus, are in contrast to the guinea-pig-model by Kay, who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss.	2.0360461426638343
The present knowledge of Streptococcus suis meningitis with respect to neurophysiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and increasing resistance against antibiotics is discussed.	2.116820675040453
The introduction of atypical antipsychotics has presented new options for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenic patients.	2.0311210455119997
It is assumed that in the near future, neuroleptic medication will shift from conventional to atypical antipsychotics for an increasing number of patients.	2.1297261011765807
The present article addresses guidelines for the conversion from conventional to atypical neuroleptics in inpatient and outpatient settings.	2.0198824038292633
Numerous epidemiological studies about multiple trauma patients do not include an analysis of patients under the age of 18.	2.736933793757635
To study this, the data of 682 patients with multiple traumata, treated between 1981 and 1991 at Hannover Medical School, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed.	2.295140602305335
The patients were divided into four age-related groups: preschool age (< 6 years), school age (< 13 years), teenagers (< 18 years) and adults (L 18 years).	2.1994723451420706
Analyzed were the cause of trauma, localization of injuries and the cause of death.	2.799040747951211
Children were less often injured as passengers in cars, but more often injured as pedestrians and bicyclists than adults.	1.9787297932591326
However, children showed a significant higher mortality than adults, with threefold increased risk of death when they injured as passengers in car accidents.	2.1477907050565777
In all groups injuries to the head and the legs were most common.	2.6003805654790773
Children showed a lower incidence of trauma to the thorax, abdomen, hip and arms than the adult group.	2.0125174565337782
Nevertheless, trauma to the thorax, abdomen and head was associated with the highest risk of death in all groups.	2.537258458130019
Spinal cord injuries, especially injuries to the neck, also showed a high risk of death.	2.710391192309429
Children younger than 6 years had the most severe head injuries.	2.59404878042855
Safety improvements for children in cars, helmet usage on bicycles and early training in traffic safety for children might decrease the lethality in this group of trauma patients.	1.9336448157081694
During the past 7 years 45 patients have been operated upon using the Childs-Phillips method.	2.077143885733904
Of those, 37 were subsequently examined for the study - 7 patients had died in the meantime.	2.3256873167403453
None of the deaths occurred as a direct result of transmesenteric small-bowel plication.	2.1294439032030072
An early recurrence of intestinal obstruction occurred in 4.4 % and a laparotomy was repeated.	2.1320728079317437
During the most recent examinations 86.5 % of those patients checked had (virtually) no complaints - 91.9 % based upon the Visick classification.	1.9649412994397808
A subtotal intestinal obstruction occurred during the period of the study in 8.1 % of cases, but could be conservatively treated.	2.685478954474661
Up until the most recent examination there were still no instances of a late recurrence.	2.177349139801672
Most intestinal obstruction recurrences are due to errors specific to the technique and are early recurrences.	2.169502888840246
On the basis of our results, we are of the opinion that plication in the presence of existing peritonitis, as well as partial plication, is acceptable.	2.5327412989700386
To prospectively survey skin lesions in a large group of newborns, as no such study has as yet been performed in Germany.	2.049701195009216
We present the case of a 35-year-old patient suffering from schizoaffective psychosis.	2.4262957504520433
After 4 weeks on clozapine he developed acute priapism.	2.1293919300963386
Possible explanations and pathophysiology are discussed as well as the requirement for sufficient information of the patient.	2.685181018512512
Delay of urgent urologic treatment incrases the risk of irreversible impotence.	2.466887363462317
The patient's history should be evaluated with respect to former unphysiological prolonged erections.	2.614721053934463
The further development of 162 stroke patients (average age 77 years), who were geriatrically assessed during hospitalization, was evaluated ca.	2.267334531910443
Questionnaires were mailed to patients.	2.4816280039693144
53% of the patients (n = 86) returned the questionnaire duly filled in; 20% (n = 32) had died; in the remaining 27% of cases (n = 44) no information was obtained on further development.	2.265955893574365
80% of those patients who responded lived at home despite numerous medical problems.	2.2439540216606835
Follow-up treatment and pain therapy proved to be particularly problematic.	2.5366213115340215
The Barthel Index according to data collected was significantly lower compared to figures noted upon release from the hospital.	2.084874263184924
Hardly anyone among those patients received follow-up treatment.	3.00742440228567
74% of patients complained of pain although the majority has regular contacts with the family doctor.	2.0917772925822704
For those patients who died in the 18 months interval, significantly lower values for the activities of daily living (ADL) has already been recorded upon hospitalization.	2.140166890274822
The routine staging work-up for renal cancer includes a contrast-enhanced multiphasic spiral CT and a chest radiograph.	2.245014015023988
If there is doubt regarding the presence and extent of (supradiaphragmatic) IVC thrombus, MR imaging should be performed.	2.099511027603854
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging should be used in place of CT in any patient with severe renal dysfunction, symptomatic polycystic kidney disease, or a history of allergy to iodinated contrast media.	2.212251654563711
Cavography is no longer needed in the era of (adaptive array detector) spiral CT and MR venography.	2.2422680875881342
Patients: We report on four infants with nonketotic hyperglycinemia, three with a neonatal form and one with the milder infantile form.	2.178064212764303
Despite early diagnosis and persistent therapy including dextromethorphan and sodium benzoate, two infants with the neonatal form deteriorated progressively and died at the age of 16 and 50 months, respectively, only one survived severely retarded with seizures, opisthotonus and spastic quadriplegia.	1.999533586405224
The serum concentrations of glycine decreased following sodium benzoate treatment but cerebrospinal fluid/serum glycine ratio remained elevated with no improvement in clinical outcome.	1.8036698734329026
The patient with the infantile form has been treated for over three years with dextromethorphan, and is now a severely retarded child without seizure activity and continuous psychomotor development.	2.008442792974078
Immunosuppression-related Candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators, notably tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN).	1.9681632248790992
Optimistically, preclinical studies to date have found that the coadministration of such immunoadjuvants does not compromise, and actually may improve, the efficacy of synthetic antifungals.	2.053595499878884
Such combination therapies should continue to be evaluated in animal models of Candida infection which otherwise progress to lethal shock or chronic disseminated disease despite aggressive use of existing antifungal agents.	1.8934246959626804
Bilateral neck exploration is the standard procedure in primary hyperparathyroidism.	2.700431377625161
Using a bilateral approach, preoperative localization studies are not mandatory.	2.2008360950257826
A localized single gland disease is the basis for a minimally invasive procedure.	2.690470119127948
Therefore preoperative localization techniques play an important role in planning (minimally invasive) first time exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism.	2.0573992163129264
The combination of 99 mTc-SestaMIBI scintigraphy with ultrasound allows correct localization of the parathyroid adenoma in 86 % of all single gland diseases.	1.870053899680122
Multiple gland disease could be predicted in isolated cases only.	2.2567801775948144
Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging could not improve the results.	2.540351976574309
Surgery for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism should only be performed after positive localization studies.	2.2702555666705884
Prehospital thrombolysis is often recommended for patients in whom a major time gain of >90 min compared to in-hospital therapy is expected.	2.1748561504884365
It has been repeatedly shown by metropolitan rescue services that very early presentation after onset of symptoms in a high percentage of patients offers an additional chance for optimizing thrombolytic therapy.	1.9725583563767464
More than half of all patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction to the EMS may be treated within 90 min after symptom onset, enabling preservation of major myocardial areas at risk.	2.3441496527742762
Thus, prehospital thrombolysis in metropolitan areas offers a chance to take advantage of an ideal time window, without additional risk.	1.9960805934665005
Moreover, technical and diagnostic preconditions are easily fulfilled.	2.216426395260498
Low resection and intersphincteric extirpation of rectal cancer in the distal third of the rectum has become an accepted sphincter-saving method.	2.2543555291134956
From December 1990 to December 1994, 42 patients (17 women and 25 men) with a mean age of 67.2 years had a low resection or extirpation of the rectum at our institution.	2.150236433303528
Eighteen patients received a transanal sutured anastomosis, 24 a stapler anastomosis.	2.213830823654146
We had a lethality rate of 2.5 % and a anastomotic insufficiency rate of 14 %.	2.1195318994497194
"NoToX Histological Fixative" is a formaldehyde substitute for the fixation of tissues prior to histological investigation.	2.081017720727757
Intraoperative samples and necropsy tissue were tested.	2.371139776579397
NoToX was substituted for formaldehyde in the fixation step, otherwise the same manufacturer-specified protocols were used for all reagents.	1.984501851566635
Conventional histological and accepted immunohistological investigations, especially for tumour diagnosis, were used.	2.2783977474721437
In all tests, results with NoToX-fixated tissue were similar to those with tissue fixed with formaldehyde regarding both staining and diagnosis.	1.9638655392229196
NoToX is a useful substitute for formaldehyde.	2.6833788827539844
The aim of this article is to provide current information on morphological parameters useful for a forensic age estimation of human skin wounds.	1.910171612031245
In addition to mainly cellular reactions detectable by routine histological or enzyme histochemical techniques, immunohistochemical parameters and their forensic value are especially discussed.	1.7509355698936375
A dynamic helical CT scan following initial ultrasound provides reliable radiological staging for kidney traumas and immediate diagnosis of most abdominal injuries.	1.8502965350770746
It also proves useful for pediatric traumas.	2.330046928652886
Using mainly CT data we apply a classification system proposed by the American Association for Surgery of Trauma (grade I-V).	1.9446210735995382
The diagnostic steps and subsequent management are demonstrated by flow-chart.	2.1352786770002647
Most renal traumas may be treated conservatively but persistent bleeding or persistent urinary extravasation may necessitate surgical intervention.	2.0466980379726722
In cases of exploration of the kidney, the use of fibrin adhesive, alloplastic mesh capsule and DJ stents enables the reconstruction of the kidney.	2.2380926140118658
Exploration of the renal injury should never be omitted if urgent laparotomy is indicated for associated injuries.	2.079584831611126
With worldwide over 1million applications, vascular closure devices have been established as an essential tool of invasive cardiology.	2.1499453977838017
This overview compares today's four commercially available closure devices, VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc. (PC) and DuettTM (DU) for their usefulness after coronary interventions.	1.6807908858790555
The published data regarding deployment success rates for VS, AS, PC and DU are in the range of 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% up to 100%, respectively.	1.9098142086127436
Times to hemostasis were 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14', accompanied by times to mobilization of 6-9h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.	2.0358627406605194
Minor complications were described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.	1.9542325434249554
Although none of the closure devices has been shown to reduce major local complications as compared to manual compression, all sealing devices have documented a significant reduction in time to hemostasis.	2.219530348355168
The increased patient comfort is essentially related to the ability of sheath removal immediately after PTCA.	2.3427587470350884
Vascular closure devices reduce the burden of medical staff and decrease hospital costs by earlier discharge.	2.0453947244292094
Amniotic fluid is a major factor of the intrauterine environment, and deviation from the normal volume is associated with an increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.	2.2110563115758954
Polyhydramnios occurs in 0.2 to 1.6 % of pregnancies.	2.3301366848461345
It may be due to a number of congenital anomalies, an abnormal karyotype, maternal diabetes, Rh-disease or intrauterine infections potentially requiring non-invasive or invasive measures.	2.1582440080196754
However, the most common indication for prenatal intervention due to polyhydramnios is the Twin-Twin-Transfusion Syndrom (TTTS).	2.0529866491337527
Treatment of polyhydramnios may focus on correction of the causative lesion, or symptomatic relief through drainage of amniotic fluid.	2.065867929357407
Maternal administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors represents a further, non-invasive therapeutic option.	2.466653556814491
Indomethacin, Sulindac, or Nimesulide reduce the fetal urine output thus decreasing amniotic fluid volume over time without the risks associated with invasive procedures.	1.8508808933717396
However, potentially serious ductal constriction as well as a delay in the onset of amniotic fluid reduction have limited its application.	2.375249605587318
Percutaneous amniotic fluid drainage may provide immediate reduction of intrauterine pressure, but is associated with a complication rate of 1 to 1.5 %.	2.347830348389871
The hemodynamic characteristics of monochorionic pregnancies complicated by TTTS have led to the development of endoscopic laser coagulation of placental vascular anastomoses as a definitive treatment.	2.083968291565456
Treatment is only required in a small minoritiy of pregnancies with polyhydramnios.	2.275770434083115
Mild cases can be managed expectatively.	2.869136886635251
The main goal of prenatal treatment of polyhydramnios is thus the improvement of fetal outcome through prolongation of gestation and/or the alleviation of maternal symptoms.	2.0455134570687905
With the recent developments in computer technology and the improvements in modern neuroimaging, frame-based stereotactic guidance for open microsurgical procedures has been increasingly replaced by neuronavigation, also called frameless stereotaxy.	1.7455166711738195
The different localization techniques employed are articulated position-sensing arms, infrared or ultrasound systems working with the principle of satellite navigation and robotic systems integrated with the operating microscope.	1.787336733168951
In 200 operations performed with different systems (arm-based, robotic and infrared) the method proved to be helpful, enabling fewer invasive procedures to be performed.	2.0477168374157935
With a mean deviation of 2.87 +/- 1.9 mm for intraoperative localization, the accuracy was only slightly worse than in frame-based stereotaxy with deviations below 2 mm.	1.8837329481092266
Neuronavigation was most helpful for operations on deeply seated lesions, skull-base tumors and lesions in brain areas with high functionality.	1.9126371526786845
The major disadvantage is the use of preoperative data for navigation, leading to inaccuracies when anatomical structures are altered during the operation by resection of tumors or shift of intracranial soft tissue.	2.1946070957023442
Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be a solution for this problem.	2.3068087799757175
With the method of intraoperative MRI developed in our department it has already been possible to update neuronavigation with images reflecting intraoperative changes in anatomy.	2.1116000483568147
Therefore, neuronavigation is definitely a method with growing importance in operative routine, and it will also spread into other surgical specialties.	1.9591223630846144
Severe pain of mucositis induced by cytostatic conditioning therapy in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients generally requires continuous parenteral opioid treatment.	1.9452634419850419
Cognitive and psychological disturbances are frequent complications subsequent to BMT and may result from cerebral opioid side effects.	2.1708774482273396
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of continuous morphine in mucositis pain and the side-effects in BMT patients.	2.2429974037987823
Particular emphasis was placed on the question of whether reaction times, which are usually measured to estimate opioid effects upon vigilance, are influenced by pain-induced cognitive impairments in pain patients.	2.1313762823428255
Methods While in hospital, 10 BMT patients were examined daily with the aid of a mucositis scale, subjective visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and mood parameters, a German version of the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), and a mental performance task battery, and the morphine given was documented.	2.117732237160002
Mental performance tests were simple auditory reaction time and choice reaction time.	2.203725540346631
Practice and baseline data were collected within the first week before BMT.	2.549827320530542
Results The intensity and duration of mucositis differed from patient to patient, resulting in different pain intensities and MPQ scores.	2.1655969117615954
Prolongation of the choice reaction time averaged over the period of mucositis treatment correlated significantly with residual pain intensity (Spearman rs = 0.88, p < 0.01) but not with morphine dose (rs = 0.35, p = 0.33).	1.9313523196545737
For the Sternberg memory search test greater correlation coefficients resulted between reaction time and morphine dose (rs = 0.86, p = 0.014) than between reaction time and residual pain intensity (rs = 0.61, p = 0.15).	1.7137529376985912
In turn, pain intensity, unlike morphine dose, was significantly correlated with high scores in the mood parameters for depression, passivity, and tiredness.	1.9820040441329705
Conclusions It is concluded that both pain and morphine can impair cognitive performance, but that these mental stressors seem to differ according to qualitative criteria.	1.9857308024426514
Whereas pain might slow reaction time by distracting a patient's attention, particularly in low mental demand tasks, morphine could interfere with more specific cognitive processes, such as short-term memory operations, that are required in more complex tasks.	2.0141050740438318
The case of a 63-year-old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described.	2.2785400004086536
Histopathological and cytopathological examination of tissue from the retroperitoneal tumor led to a diagnosis of lymphoreticular neoplasia.	2.2557381479229326
The patient died in acute cardiac failure, five weeks after initial presentation.	2.122762617779541
Autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium.	2.4615011101736552
Macroscopically, the bone marrow appeared normal.	2.839081104590326
The tumor cells were reactive for CD45, vimentin and chloroacetate esterase, but were unreactive with a broad spectrum of antibodies against myelomonocytic and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c-kit (CD117), characteristic markers for mast cells.	1.733512187507057
However, the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis.	2.4051065966736953
A diagnosis of bone marrow mastocytosis with an associated secondary extramedullary mast cell sarcoma was established.	2.041893127554704
The cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic atrioseptal tumor nodule.	2.257943151685187
Thrombembolic events as paraneoplastic complications in malignant disease account for severe morbidity and mortality in these patients.	2.230531863177213
In some cases disturbance in hemostasis is the first manifestation of a neoplastic process.	2.413149192639436
We report the cases of two patients with cerebral and extracerebral vessel occlusions, in whom epithelial tumors of low malignant potential (borderline-tumors) of ovar and peritoneum were diagnosed later on.	1.992435714071524
In one case the removal of the tumor stopped the coagulation problems.	2.555955643958792
The second patient died a few days after the first symptoms with devastating multiple vessel occlusion.	2.475749714544169
In stroke of unknown aetiology a paraneoplastic process should be kept in mind.	2.118329875674949
The diagnosis is more probable with recurrent thrombembolism in different body regions and when warfarin therapie was ineffective.	1.8474176123947668
Thoughtful coagulation studies and a tumor search program is recommended in these cases.	2.426476302652157
Brain-stem gliomas occur mainly in childhood and are localized in the mesencephalon, pons and medulla oblongata.	2.088620851215121
Diagnosis is a domain of MRI, requiring T2, T1 and KM.	2.079421096151092
CT shows hemorrhage and calcification well.	2.4184505427796883
The criteria are the primary site, size, tumor growth, brain-stem enlargement, delineation, intralesional structure, exophytic components and enhancement.	1.942102178871521
In CT glioma are hypodense, in MRI hyperintense in T2 and hypointense in T1.	1.8924310599622618
Enhancement is seen in 25-60% and does not allow differentiation of tumor vs nontumor or gradings.	2.1692460871974117
Factors influencing poor outcome are high grade, a short history, cranial nerve involvement, severe brain-stem enlargement, pontine site, diffuse growth and recurrency.	1.9107443473103352
The 5-year-survival rate is 30% (after radiation: focal tumors 85%, diffuse 20%).	2.2272947305298136
Most frequent are symptoms of brain pressure, cerebellum, cranial nerves and pyramidal tract.	2.076965414493116
There is no agreement on whether biopsy is necessary or not.	2.076685390972369
A diagnosis of tumor is highly suggestive if classical MRI findings fit the clinical history.	1.9978105068318854
Radiobiological and physical examinations suggest clinical advantages of heavy ion irradiation.	2.162039937066958
We report the result of 23 women and 22 men (median age 48 years) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, from December 1997 until September 1999.	1.8584053938070677
The study included patients with chordomas (17), chondrosarcomas (10) and other skull base tumors (Table 1).	1.993211813739928
All patients had computed tomography for three-dimensional-treatment planning (Figure 1).	2.243527764761063
Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE).	1.834808342011009
Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients.	2.7080050958408344
Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15,5%) (Figure 2).	2.595344318429862
One-year local control rate was 94%.	2.3491718763957117
One patient (2,2%) deceased.	2.8686119413472153
No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed.	2.18452929602309
Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study.	2.3532165596194976
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary.	2.262904278769124
To continue our project a new heavy ion acclerator exclusively for clinical use is planed to be constructed in Heidelberg.	1.9610242831394056
Indirect trauma to the shoulder and knee joint often results in injuries to the ligaments and the capsule, and more rarely in fractures.	2.1522513676164023
Anterior shoulder dislocation is common.	2.612620643672182
Over the last few years arthroscopic repair of the torn labrum has become established as the therapy of choice.	2.3471168367095676
Isolated ruptures of the collateral ligaments of the knee can be treated functionally.	2.9589701493239122
A torn anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint can be compensated by the quadriceps muscle if this is adequately prepared by special exercises.	2.2943065948335954
Chronic or combined instabilities should be treated surgically by ACI grafting techniques.	2.345209583469882
Menisceal injuries are treated arthroscopically.	2.734250738802544
Objective: Comparison of low back pain (LBP) patients with and without fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) with regard to affective distress.	2.371288078240082
Methods: Patients with LBP who had been admitted to various clinics in Germany were examined upon admission.	2.1086120557227575
Comparisons were done by dividing the patients into groups with and without signs of FMS.	2.3362238212251842
Additionally, both groups were compared after being matched according to sex, age, and pain severity.	2.3495448260832372
Results: 15 out of 135 LBP patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia.	1.921882450684907
Patients with FMS showed remarkably higher levels of pain severity and affective distress.	2.057173400026417
After controlling for different levels of pain severity, these pronounced differences disappeared.	2.2544890670864297
Conclusion: Affective distress is not a unique feature of FMS, but seem to be caused entirely by higher levels of pain severity.	2.291763236729365
Methods: Cases of invasive HI-infections were reported in a national active surveillance program.	2.133950450627979
The case definition required the typical clinical picture and a HI positive culture from a physiologically sterile site (or throat swab or tracheal aspirate in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia) in children up to 10 years.	1.9766066578741248
All initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status, type of vaccine, therapy, outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria.	2.401157325978656
The relation between the type of Hib vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame.	2.2487707559840917
Results: 310 confirmed cases of invasive HI infections were reported during the observation period, 199 of these with meningitis, 56 with epiglottitis.	2.010105046536394
The number of cases declined from 71 in the last six months of 1992, 120 in 1993, and 65 in 1994 to 54 cases in 1995.	2.091651828671602
In 1995 the incidence in up to 5 year old children was 1.1/100 000 for all infection sites and 0.7/100 000 for meningitis.	1.9553273527991357
The reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of unvaccinated cases, whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children fluctuated between 22 and 36 per year.	2.7160299923518467
Most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children, who according to the German recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection.	2.3887281303059384
The type of vaccine (HbOC, PRP-D or OMP) was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children.	2.2917470581722545
10 % of the bacteria produced betalactamase.	2.828391802279059
In accordance with the German recommendations third generation cephalosporines were used in almost all cases of meningitis.	2.3895710191838897
One third of these, however, received additional antibiotics.	2.863166799710177
Conclusions: The present incidence of systemic HI infections in Germany is low.	2.356617242827333
A further decrease, however, would be possible with "on time" completion of the vaccination schedule according to the German recommendations in all children.	2.457174951244714
For more than a century peritoneal adhesions are being recognized as frequent sequelae following abdominal surgery.	2.0430023091395393
Intraoperative lesions of the mesothelial lining by abrasion, ischemia, dissication, and foreign bodies result in complaints, intestinal obstruction, female infertility, and problems during reoperations.	1.9080846955993056
The global increase of life expectancy and surgical procedures are leading to rising incidences of adhesion-related complications and subsequent socio-economic implications.	2.1169483274628353
As of today, there is no safe and efficient prophylaxis available.	2.607244230549372
Even today the name of F. D. von Recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.	2.128577966045817
He was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones, and in many aspects his work remains valid today.	2.3636228811226556
He succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases.	2.0323878247547684
He also described the phenomenon of "bone remodeling" which has become relevant today again.	2.096998549565361
Although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include meticulously precise differentiations which make it difficult to study them today, they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas.	2.0443456909447044
This article does not constitute a comprehensive biography, but it contains a description of F. D. von Recklinghausen's important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life.	1.973618382742271
Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences.	2.767360506275671
Limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation.	2.082804032786343
In order to evaluate isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion (ILP) in a multimodality therapy concept, we reviewed our patients treated using this method.	1.9573565135677649
Between January 1982 and December 1995, 25 ILPs, using cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin, were performed in 22 patients with STS.	2.0678543664105486
Forty percent were treated for local recurrences; histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and synovial sarcoma.	1.9357469852341742
In all, 68 % of the STS were classified as UICC stage IIb or IIIa/b.	2.0705279390453595
Most of the cases (14) underwent wide or radical resection, 4 patients received intraoperative radiotherapy, and 5 were treated with external beam radiation.	2.46127441784481
Complications were recorded in 32 % of the cases.	2.644249094246976
With a median follow-up of 45 months (range 1-143), the 5-year overall survival rate was 81 %.	2.7753403422172154
The median recurrence-free time was 19 months and the 5-year disease-free survival rate 34 %.	2.4071637740635907
There were 13 local failures, and distant metastases developed in 36 % of the patients.	2.2014245185567023
Five of 11 patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation, and 7 incompletely resected STS received ILP without reoperation.	1.8865703306789035
All of these demonstrated local recurrence.	2.3971040249721183
This rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor-free resection margins (p = 0.0001, log-rank test).	2.26495930147737
The amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was 27 % (mean 11 months after treatment).	2.0899032213941022
Long-term results of ILP showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease-free survival.	2.322915013643467
Perfusion in patients without tumor-free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence.	2.3571865414476068
We conclude that ILP with cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice.	2.205671490390641
We report about two healthy children with pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile without an underlying illness or a former history of antibiotic treatment.	1.7808111231195332
We report the case of a 21-year-old woman with definite HD whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes that were misinterpreted as schizophrenia for 7 years.	1.9503731339493025
One reason for this misdiagnosis was the unusual, very early onset and the remarkable earlier age of onset of HD compared with that of other affected relatives.	1.9258511126316984
The phenomenon of earlier onset within one affected family is well documented in the literature in cases with the paternally transmitted mutated gene.	2.2685789327928076
Diagnostic landmarks were consideration of the initially mild disturbances of movement and the once again repeated detailed examination of the family history.	2.288972545682824
ICD-10 is to be implemented for morbidity coding in Germany soon.	2.4772052101611672
The electronic versions of ICD-10 are introduced.	2.1951971203237237
For everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by DIMDI: ICD-10 meta files, ICD conversion tables, ICD-10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms.	1.6336897151066703
All files are available free of charge via the INTERNET.	1.9194838272862527
Because of poorly compartmentalized paraclavicular soft tissues, total extraperiostal claviculectomy in cases of malignoma with cortical destruction is always marginal.	2.0127590976972636
Due to different muscular compensation in the patients examined, literature disagrees on the biomechanical consequences of claviculectomy for the shoulder girdle.	2.024293039980868
Thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has proved to be an established method; but intra- and postoperatively, there is a high risk of bleeding complications.	2.674547483983193
A 50-year old female with familiar hypophosphatasia and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture.	2.1509784098301834
Intraoperatively, petCO2 suddenly dropped, paCO2 rose, and circulatory arrest occurred.	2.009758884201271
CPR was started immediately with closed-chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines.	2.1410294562092322
While continuing CPR, surgery was stopped, the wound was sealed provisionally, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.	2.3842303258714246
Because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in a total dosage of 100 mg was begun.	2.1506992720510856
2.25 hours after the onset of circultory arrest, and 1.5 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis, the patient's hemodynamic patterns under high-dosage catecholamines were satisfactory.	2.283363380033257
The bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions.	2.1068466373855532
The situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver, spleen and small intestines, which required surgical intervention, and acute renal failure, which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration.	2.387654257241564
A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs, capnometry, blood gas analysis, and electrocardiography.	2.3605430681672237
Due to the requirements of the emergency situation (ongoing CPR), further diagnostic tools were not used.	2.276616429745971
The patient survived without any neurological deficiency, despite the extended 135-min use of CPR, and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma, and to performing CPR in the presence of fibrinolytica.	2.1304140784278007
With the increasing use of cross-sectional echocardiography in patients with overt or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency rooms, more and more right atrial thrombi are detected.	2.264792083438094
These are so-called "transitthrombi" from the venous system on their way to the pulmonary arteries and they are a severe presentation of thromboembolic disease.	2.2633584558619604
They appear as an imminent pulmonary embolism and usually coexists with an already massive embolism.	2.1178584418105677
In patients were a right atrial thrombus is associated with a patent foramen ovale, paradoxical arterial embolism has been observed.	2.258418998200183
Right sided heart thrombi have a high mortality rate and need immediate treatment.	2.3784947780768353
In our hospital we have seen 14 patients with right atrial thrombi and pulmonary embolism in a period of 6 years.	2.44263251025001
All patients were treated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis without pulmonary angiography.	2.3049728434553667
In about half of the cases transesophageal echocardiography was done additionally for diagnosis and monitoring.	2.5614487191015365
Therapeutic options were thrombectomy, fibrinolysis or anticoagulants.	2.203178790246782
We treated one of our patients with thrombectomy, eleven patients with fibrinolysis and two patients with anticoagulants.	2.3712610597500707
The era of modern anaesthesia in Germany began on January 24th, 1847.	2.0701612394767244
This day, professor in ordinary Johann Ferdinand Heyfelder anaesthetized a patient with sulphuric ether in the clinic of surgery and ophthalmology of the University of Erlangen.	2.2187933832526636
By March 17th, 1847, Heyfelder had performed 121 surgical procedures under ether.	2.0409914574773236
The operations in majority were teeth-extractions, and a few more complex operations such as the treatment of a harelip or of lip cancer or the resection of the shoulder joint.	2.4969470302283607
Heyfelder described in detail 108 of these inhalations in a little book entitled The experiments with sulphuric ether.	2.030745579635151
This monograph published in March, 1847, represents one of the first complete dissertations on sulphuric ether in the German literature.	2.305632353344537
In a special chapter he analyzed the development of various physiological and psychological parameters during etherization.	2.328416511415964
Heyfelder also examined blood and urine of some etherized patients and reported that he did not find any important or specific alterations.	1.9125947052950296
In 1847, Heyfelder was probably the first to apply salt-ether in man.	2.1732450877027927
After 4 administrations he concluded that salt ether acted more quickly but shorter than sulphuric ether.	1.8266365493442225
Advantageous were its application without problems and ease of induction.	2.2920836157523707
Disadvantageous were its high volatility, its price and the difficulty of getting it in a pure form.	1.9756550798506318
From December, 1847, on Heyfelder started to use chloroform.	2.194574155200674
He was now able to perform more major operations, for example the total resection of the hip-joint.	2.546044505246411
In his book The experiments with sulphuric ether, salt ether, and chloroform he describes a great number of anaesthetic administrations using these 3 agents.	1.797498808646561
In his summary Heyfelder concluded, that chloroform was undoubtly superior to sulphuric ether mainly because it was a quicker acting and longer lasting agent and leads to deeper narcosis.	1.7865144840704819
Moreover its application was much easier for it needed no special apparatus.	2.07652339253108
However, because of its great anaesthetic potency, Heyfelder particularly demanded great caution in the application of chloroform.	2.226812025692616
Explicitely he expected an assistant for chloroformizations, whose only duty was to supervise the inhalations and the patient - a forerunner of the modern specialized anaesthesiologist.	1.9303018901357805
Background: To evaluate the publication rate of abstracts presented during the German Anaesthesia Congress (DAK) in MEDLINE-listed journals in comparison to the publication rate of abstracts presented during the meeting of the European Society of Anaesthesiologists (ESA).	1.7859370484609176
In particular, the embryonic brain is suitable for transvaginal ultrasound examination, because the large "cystic" cavities of the brain can easily be imaged.	2.2019088429317057
Sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy and normal relations and proportions of organs, but also the development of structural abnormalities.	2.50174628179892
Approximately one-third of all congenital anomalies, originate from the central nervous system (CNS).	2.1187008598472827
Based on normal sonoembryology and on recent experiences with early CNS anomalies, we recognize some sonographic signs of an early CNS anomaly: (1) Apparent dysmorphology of the brain or the head; (2) Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain compartments, where the amount of fluid is either greater or less than normal; (3) In the early fetal period, choroid plexuses that are too small to fill the ventricle from the medial to the lateral wall; (4) Irregular contour of the spine/back; (5) Extra-CNS anomalies.	2.0633121682096704
In the following survey, normal sonoembryology of the CNS is described, and CNS anomalies of the early pregnancy are discussed.	2.0790433033303692
Telomerase is an enzyme that elongates telomeric repeats, the specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that provide genomic stability and compensate for the physiologic process of telomere shortening.	1.7948963500706319
It has been implicated in cellular senescence, immortalization, and carcinogenesis.	2.1213962863097304
Over 85% of human tumours, and 95% of non-melanocytic skin cancers, show telomerase activity, in contrast to the corresponding normal tissues.	2.311839129926415
This suggests that telomerase activity may play an important role in carcinogenesis.	2.3043387319552733
Recent evidence shows that telomerase is active not only in embryonal and germ line tissues, but also in some normal tissues.	2.1249853729685877
In the skin, this activity has been traced to the stem-cell-bearing epidermal basal cell layer, possibly reflecting the presence of telomerase-competent stem cells.	2.138212175423169
These findings require a reconsideration of our interpretation of telomerase activity in tumours of the skin and other tissues.	2.231724977095276
As a causal relationship linking telomerase activity and cancer has yet not been demonstrated, some caution is warranted.	1.9145634308899697
The established criteria of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) such as JV latency, JI-V interpeak latency and interaural differences of  latency or amplitude have been found to be sensitive for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle if a response is present.	1.9024421341190774
However, the ABR can be absent in cases of acoustic neuromas because of desynchronization, even though pure-one audiometry indicates that responses should be present.	2.0025378801157636
This retrospective study compared the ABR and pure-tone thresholds in 234 cases with cerebellopontine angle tumors and a control group of 181 cases with sensory hearing losses in order to quantify threshold discrepancies.	2.1147943805521976
The average deficit of the objective ABR threshold (DOABRT) to the subjective pure-tone threshold for those frequencies between 1-6 kHz was 3.6 dB for the control group (ABR and pure tone thresholds very close) and 31.2 dB for the tumor group (ABR threshold much higher than the pure-tone threshold).	1.923737239869161
ABR thresholds 30 dB higher than the high-frequency pure tone thresholds were found in 40.6% of the tumor group and in none of the control group.	2.626695678168785
Thus, deficits of the ABR threshold >30 dB can be considered to be an additional criterion for detecting retrocochlear disease and increases ABR sensitivity for tumor detection even if responses are absent.	2.1146851329873826
The association of nevus flammeus with mongolian spot, nevus fuscoceruleus, nevus spilus and, with variable frequency, with nevus anemicus has been termed phacomatosis pigmentovascularis, a genodermatosis first described by Ota and co-workers.	1.7293558284820634
Four different combinations have been specified.	2.453209641545605
Most cases are reported from the Japanese literature.	2.4417108341284743
Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis may constitute an exclusively cutaneous disorder, but overlapping with other syndromes like Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or Sturge-Weber syndrome is also possible.	1.7950989670732618
We report a 30-year-old woman with nevus flammeus on the back and right arm associated with nevus fuscoceruleus on the back.	2.1466764606761375
ORIF management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type A3 of the A0 classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments, particularly when only the sliding hip-screw is used for fixation.	2.118460422637108
A connectable butt-press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation.	2.420564390372663
We review the results with this fixation technique in 22 elderly patients with an average age of 76 years who presented with highly unstable trochanteric fracture of the A3 type.	2.2736368666285394
Three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed.	2.1168030752215325
The other 19 were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred.	2.090038951110519
Complaints, leg shortening and changes in the CCD angle were recorded.	2.617698956358316
Furthermore, the mobility score was determined.	2.359715482528433
Although the patients were able to bear full weight after the operation, no lateral dislocation of fragments was observed.	2.4504120168334693
Only 1 patient had a varus dislocation of 5  ° until the fracture had consolidated.	2.2603484989267724
This was due to severe osteopenia and subsequent dislocation of the screw within the femoral head.	2.4805360230498557
Five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained.	2.4585280028486562
On the basis of this review, we recommend the use of this new connectable buttress plate with sliding hip screws because it provides sifficient fixation of highly unstable fractures of type A3.	2.369729028933095
There is a characteristic predilection for the cerebellum and eighth cranial nerve.	2.078189183684336
Accordingly, among a variety of symptoms, cerebellar ataxia and sensorineural hearing loss progressing to total deafness commonly occur.	2.2502596712806326
To date, the hearing loss has been believed to be purely neural.	2.020161113946317
We present a case of superficial hemosiderosis in a patient with total deafness who was successfully provided with a cochlear implant.	2.2885074828114806
Audiometry demonstrated total bilateral cochlear hearing losses but with preserved function of the eighth cranial nerve.	2.1354887845730564
These findings make us conclude that in contrast to current opinion, superficial hemosiderosis can initially damage the cochlea alone.	2.031323790257882
Thus, patients with total deafness due to this disorder may benefit from cochlear implantation.	2.3300538236289765
All patients require careful audiometric assessment, including promontory stimulation.	2.12368637859167
Intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis.	2.4633748887050637
Features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed.	2.4986128528554596
For the first time, the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self-experienced neuropsychological deficits for the fater development of schizophrenia.	2.1426690843643734
Ninety-six patients with DSM-III-R diagnoses mainly of the formerly neurotic or personality disordered field, of whom 81 % had shown such basic disorders at the time of the index examination and therefore were classified as persons at high risk of developing schizophrenia, were re-examined for schizophrenia.	2.045757963393822
After an average follow-up period of about 8 years, more than half of the re-examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to DSM-III-R.	2.2586631344785344
To date, at least 12 types of primary dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis.	2.262368547130195
A 3-bp deletion in the DYT1 gene causes early onset, generalized torsion dystonia (TD), and mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5).	1.8251355192112733
A missense change in the D2 dopamine receptor in one large family (DYT11) has recently been implicated in myoclonus-dystonia.	2.0157389198741424
Furthermore, seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions, including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype (DYT6), one form of focal dystonia (DYT7), three types of paroxysmal dystonia (DYT8-10), X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT3), and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12).	1.837199646267114
No positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive TD (DYT2) and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited TD (DYT4).	1.8882039009930862
In addition, hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia, metabolic and storage disorders, and various X-linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia.	2.0201653361621856
It may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely nondegenerative disorders.	2.072737085024232
In this study we investigated whether, in conjunction with neuroleptics, a psychoeducational and cognitively oriented treatment for schizophrenic outpatients and their key-persons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness within a 2-year follow-up.	2.0378214318220085
This prospective randomized study covered a total of 191 schizophrenic patients (according to DSM-III-R) and comprised a psychoeducational training and cognitive psychotherapy for patients and counseling for their key persons in various combinations.	2.0590469782703322
Patients were examined before, immediately after and 2 years after the end of the intervention.	2.54921522794941
Patients in the treatment groups reduced their overall psychopathology and their attention deficit.	2.4639445999410774
For patients receiving all three treatment conditions, there was a relevant preventive effect with regard to the rehospitalization rate appearing during the second year of the follow-up.	2.2359708902286886
We conclude that in the mid-term, a combination of psychoeducational and cognitively oriented therapy for patients and their keypersons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness.	2.4738243250330925
Background: Cigarette smoking is common during pregnancy and can expose the developing fetus to transplacental carcinogens, but relatively little information is available on fetal uptake of such compounds.	1.836861901615415
It was the aim of the present study to analyze the first urine of newborns of mothers who did or did not smoke for metabolites of the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) as well as nicotine and cotinine.	2.1056435460412968
Recently there has been an increase in the prevalent HIV infected population in Germany because of declines in progression to AIDS and death while the number of newly infected patients remains constant.This increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention.	1.9651092560528272
Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an HIV infected person by a route through which transmission is possible, is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases.	2.1569098861042835
Economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether PEP should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for PEP should be used for other HIV prevention or treatment interventions.The value of PEP depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention.	2.1305745961076688
In this paper, we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of PEP in different population subgroups, including those occupationally exposed, those exposed through unprotected sex, and those exposed through IV drug use.	1.9233192741456977
The cost-effectiveness of PEP is also compared to literature estimates of the cost-effectiveness of other prevention activities.	2.176539876442482
The aim of this study was to access the importance of the laparoscopic colorectal resection.	2.1855324664389966
Of 131 patients 80 were operated on laparoscopically.	2.575681572920913
The conversion rate was 14 % (13/93).	2.3154596249867505
A total of 47 patients suffered from cancer.	2.4894304059341947
Curative resection was performed in 41 patients (87 %).	2.771058175908317
For comparison, 48 patients who underwent open resection were used.	2.5277192741912935
The complication rate was lower after laparoscopy and no reoperation was performed.	2.058302709663724
Patients recovered quicker and their first oral food intake and bowel movement were earlier.	2.0126181991638767
Hospital stay was shorter (15.3 vs. 8.1 days), and pain at rest and in motion was significantly reduced.	2.5071394757897347
Equal numbers of mesenteric lymph nodes were retrieved; adequate margins of resection could be obtained and the length of resected bowel did not differ.	2.206330691756317
No port metastases were observed.	2.6116061521189677
Reduced morbidity, reduced hospital stay, reduced abdominal pain, quicker reconvalescence, and reduced overall health care costs are strong arguments in favor of laparoscopic colectomy.	2.0924918439480784
In the field of traumatology, compartment syndromes of the lower extremity are often seen after fractures and direct injuries, or after ischaemia.	2.185935026607233
Other causes include over-exertion and non-traumatic causes such as acute rhabdomyolysis, drug-induced myositis and eosinophilic myositis.	2.0860784767588347
This paper describes the clinical and MR course of a compartment syndrome following an ankle sprain.	2.3579865090632026
Each patient has the right of a dedicated pain therapy according to the state of the art.	2.614294645064748
However an efficient pain therapy is not possible without knowing the cause of pain.	2.7532052746746563
In most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system.	1.8118777171425782
Mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions.	2.2916142043834387
The therapeutic regime of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is demonstrated by algorithms of treatment modalities.	2.049907237880073
Apart from classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well.	2.0548441202839673
Prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy.	2.2639643963857123
In posttraumatic pain, however, a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of triggerpoints may be helpful.	2.304297253928392
The exeptional place of sympathetic blockades are in diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic maintained pain (SMP).	2.112001108786372
Effects of 94 different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well-being in the elderly were meta-analyzed.	2.192957412429369
Psychological well-being was improved and self-rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation.	2.417201638317264
The mean effect size for other-rated depression reached d=1.15.	2.040830064475817
Whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self-rated well-being or depression, other-rated depression improved less in older samples.	2.043238202348514
High effect sizes derived from control-enhancing interventions and behavior therapy.	2.091868216570911
Sub-analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting.	2.043421048525121
Higher "therapeutic" qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect-sizes too.	2.0336783411325277
Implications for planning inteventions in old age are discussed.	2.413116103712614
The prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma worsens dramatically with the discovery of primary or secondary lymph node metastases.	2.280095784651001
Thus consistent prophylaxis and therapy of metastases is indispensable.	2.672397005950648
The standard therapy of manifest cervical lymph node metastases is surgery, if possible using the approach of conservative neck dissection.	2.28860343791525
In cases of a lymph node stage N3, i.e.	2.1394501091511247
fixated metastases with a diameter greater than 6 cm, individually adapted therapy in necessary because of the extremely poor prognosis.	2.291749694160134
Objective: The German Ophthalmologic Society is rising to the challenges of the information age by offering comprehensive information resources online.	1.8515605555046581
Objective responses of 20%-35% have been reported in patients with disseminated melanoma and renal cell carcinoma who received high-dose intravenous IL-2 in combination with interferon- (IFN).	2.7196306539347046
However, treatment with IL-2 is complicated by a syndrome of life-threatening adverse reactions such as disseminated vascular leakage, fluid retention, severe hypotension, and (reversible) multiple organ dysfunction (MODS).	2.232030112884978
A systemic inflammatory reaction (SIRS)/sepsis sepsis-like haemodynamic pattern has been described in patients after IL-2 bolus application alone.	2.2437440232784147
Our purpose was to study the haemodynamic changes in patients treated with high-dose IL-2 administered as a constant infusion and in combination with IFN.	2.6285279932950054
We used the international histologic classification set up by the World Health Organisation in 1992.	2.0091586159154264
The aim of this study was to investigate the differentiation of various types of cyst using an immunohistochemical technique rather than by conventional morphological assessment.	1.943489255399526
About five per cent of the children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia are asymptomatic during parturition and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.	2.0179100200006745
We report about particularities of "late-presenters" with congenital diaphragmatic hernias namely funnel chest and a fatal outcome of an associated acute gastric volvulus.	1.8041186996781247
The retrospective results of carbon prostheses for knee ligament reconstruction in 120 patients, as established by questionnaire, are reported at 10  +/-  2 years follow-up.	2.1021754861798256
Some 60 % of the patients showed good subjective function at reduced activity level.	2.552938514212838
Complications were seen in 72.5 % of the patients with rupture of the carbon prosthesis and in 68 % of those with synovitis.	2.757796992394993
X-ray showed osteoarthritis in up to 59 % of the patients.	2.7319786150325958
Carbon prostheses for collateral ligament reconstruction (85 % medial, 5.8 % lateral) were successful in 75 % of cases.	2.0663731315996983
Activity and time seem to be less responsible for failure of the carbon prostheses than the features of growing in.	2.3207452797526416
Destruction of the knee joint over time is due to reactive synovitis and catabolic enzyme reaction and correlates with joint effusion and pain.	2.2023380100966534
If these problems appear, (arthroscopic) resection of the synovia is indicated to interrupt the circulus vitiosus.	2.005419231007094
Background: With resprect to very early screening it has become necessary to apply laboratory techniques more sensitive and more precise than the formerly used Guthrie-test to guarantee correct detection of hyperphenylalaninemias.	1.809773402966876
Three quantitative methods were compared.	2.6178345460242793
The Viennese Medical School played an important role in the development of radiological examinations and signs of the temporal bone with conventional X-rays.	2.6119793847757116
Famous pioneers include E. G. Mayer (1893-1969) and L. Psenner (1910-1986).	1.8076197338446691
Nowadays conventional X-rays and tomography have lost their important role in diagnostic radiology of the temporal bone, but the basic principles established in those early years of radiology are still used now.	2.2191504947001213
The success of interventional catheter based therapy of coronary artery disease is still limited by a high rate of chronic restenosis.	2.4155792701173016
Using alternative mechanical techniques, there is increasing evidence that restenosis can be prevented in certain subsets of patients by optimized balloon angioplasty, DCA and stenting as well as by the combined approach of primary tissue removal with adjunctive stent implantation.	2.0781404052460344
Additional pharmacologic interventions and possibly genetic and/or radiotherapeutic approaches will be highly important for future reduction of restenosis.	2.2154760124823936
161 duraplasties of the frontal skull base carried out from 1979 to 1994 at the ENT-department Fulda were evaluated in a retrospective study in regard to etiology, operative techniques and results.	2.163685190049772
Duraplasty of the rhinobasis was indicated in 70 cases of rhinobasal trauma, 47 cases after paranasal sinus surgery, 36 cases of tumors and 8 malformations.	1.8944647185882881
After an average follow-up time of 6 years the patients were interviewed for postoperative liquorrhea, sinusitis treated with antibiotics and meningitis.	2.3899817822928733
As an objective measure to verify the tight closure of the treated CSF-leaks a fluoreszein test was performed in 50,9 % 6 to 8 weeks after the operation.	2.301705300217326
Duraplasty was successfull in more than 96 %.	2.6379365288094063
The approach and technique to perform a duraplasty have to be choosen individually considering size, location and etiology of the dural defect.	2.1742512664114066
In the majority of dural defects in the area of the frontal skull base reconstruction can be carried out now a days via an endonasal approach.	2.3299332650632225
By use of allogenic tissue, a mucosal flap from the surrounding area to cover the graft and fibrin clue good results were obtained.	2.0896739978161722
The tophus is a characteristic and pathognomonic sign of chronic gout.	2.350925965857527
Before effective drugs were available for the treatment of hyperuricaemia about 50 - 60% of patients with gout developed clinically and radiologically apparent urate crystal deposits.	2.6309367497595
Clinical cutaneous manifestations of chronic gout are now rarely observed.	2.3401577752446516
However, the presence of degenerative tissues, as in idiopathic osteoarthritis of the fingers, may predispose to the deposition of urate crystals.	2.167245676412786
We report on a patient with secondary - probably diuretic-induced - hyperuricaemia and gout tophi in Heberden's nodes.	1.7965617554333617
HIV-1-associated encephalopathy (HIVE) remains an important manifestation of advanced HIV infection despite recent progress in antiretroviral therapy.	2.09669232219156
This is in part due to particular pharmacological and virological characteristics of the central nervous system (CNS).	2.0592301948736225
HIVE is characterized by a "subcortical" dementia with psychomotor slowing as well as memory and concentration deficits.	2.6598916236413093
An invariable finding are deficits of central motor function.	2.196111148014866
Pathogenetically, an enhanced viral replication in immunocompetent CNS cells is believed to be a requirement.	2.2968126151146375
This leads to neurotoxic effects directly elicited by viral products as well as indirectly by the immune response to virus infection.	2.190085039811602
HIV-1 myelopathy (HIVM) is the other CNS manifestion of late HIV infection.	2.1903081445019574
The present consensus paper recommends diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in HIVE and HIVM and outlines the current research.	2.0171086758738035
Background: Prognostic data heart failure rely on epidemiological studies or large clinical trials.	2.053765053407527
These data are not to transfer easily on everyday practice.	2.237836951559322
Forty-nine patients (mean age, 54 years) admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry.	2.146717116731605
The mean follow-up was 36 months (range, 19-54 months).	2.4173270179673776
The deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure.	2.13384977234969
Using a clinical score, most of the patients had satisfactory results.	2.905291636760192
The plantar pressure distribution showed significant load asymmetries of patients with satisfactory results and those with non-satisfactory results.	2.4773565441786096
Dynamic gait analysis allows quantification of gait asymmetry and clinically non-visible gait disorder.	1.9747436172172153
Comparison of radiation exposure applied by different types of CT scanners for the investigation of the chest and abdomen.	2.4131129644851113
Determination of radiation exposure applied by multi-phase spiral CT. Estimation of the dose in air in the system axis of the scanner, the CT dose index (CTDI) and the effective dose for electron beam tomography (EBT) and two conventional CT scanners (sequence, SEQ; spiral, SCT).	1.9557547092835856
For EBT, dose in system axis for investigation of the abdomen was above 50 mGy.	2.1565800224240075
Effective dose for investigation of the chest and abdomen was higher with EBT (11 and 26 mSv, respectively) than with conventional CT (SEQ, 4 and 20 mSv; SCT, 2 and 7 mSv).	2.016493910953284
The effective dose for a biphasic investigation (liver 5 mSv, kidney 4 mSv) was below, for a triphasic investigation (liver 7 mSv) above the effective dose of the investigastion of the abdomen (6 mSv).	1.8815317626000208
Investigation of the abdomen with the EBT should only be performed for certain indications.	2.401489925047536
Bone fracture, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients, and these patients are known to be immunocompromised.	2.6091885783291033
Nonetheless, it is difficult to differentiate the effect of soft-tissue trauma plus hemorrhage from that of bone fracture and hemorrhage on host immune function in the clinical setting.	2.5898625935136503
To determine this experimentally, closed bone fracture (right lower leg) and/or soft-tissue trauma (2.5 cm midline laparotomy) were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial BP of 35  +/-  5 mm Hg for 90 min) in male C3H/HeN mice.	1.9885322534525856
All animals were killed at 72 h after initiation of the experiment and the spleens were collected aseptically.	2.0718933378340054
More significant depression of splenocyte IL-2 and IL-3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage.	2.056920542701241
The present study suggests that different traumatic insults, i. e. bone fracture as well as soft-tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock, produce comparable depression of host immune function.	2.246647919271627
Moreover, combination of closed bone fracture and soft-tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity.	2.0792433543899507
This indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft-tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage.	2.0580662596236112
The markedly depressed immune function following bony injury, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation.	2.2191039894155153
In the management of acute major vessel occlusion, the use of fibrinolytic agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), urokinase or streptokinase is widely accepted.	2.1936757039630757
Today, the spectrum of indications for thrombolytic drugs comprises acute myocardial infarction, lung embolism, ischaemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and acute arterial occlusions of the lower limbs.	2.269099571639627
In view of the histopathological and clinical features of retinal vessel occlusion, fibrinolysis aimed at early restoration of blood flow appears to be a promising therapeutic approach.	2.308691048631199
Basically, it is of some concern that the systemic administration of fibrinolytic agents is associated with a haemorrhagic risk.	2.576877414622699
Since this includes cerebral haemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, the choice of an appropriate intravenous thrombolytic therapy in a non-life threatening situation such as central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) should be based on minimising the risk of adverse events.	2.1370857397288385
Furthermore, the fibrinolytic treatment of choice should be able to produce rapid and complete restoration of retinal capillary and arterial or venous blood flow and maintain patency long enough for retinal salvage to take place.	1.9445454690951107
In this article, we review several studies of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with retinal vessel occlusion to determine whether this treatment is likely to improve major clinical outcomes.	2.320285720837425
Moreover, we review the large scale trials of fibrinolysis in myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic regimens.	2.0292991697919254
In light of the fact that the occurrence of bleeding complications constitutes a dose dependent problem, we conclude that the use of low dose regimens should be the ideal approach to fibrinolysis in retinal vessel occlusion.	2.364819736098811
Although the results of our pilot studies must be interpreted with caution, we believe that the administration of low-dose rt-PA (50 mg) in a frontloaded manner ( = simultaneous administration of rt-PA and intravenous heparin) constitutes a reasonable treatment option in patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or ischaemic retinal vein occlusion (RVO), recent onset of symptoms (CRAO <= 12 h, RVO <= 11 d) and severe visual loss ( <= 20/50).	2.0997909656791465
Because of these limitations and the numerous contraindications of fibrinolytic therapy, only a limited number of patients will be suitable for this treatment.	2.314466509588816
This study was designed to determine the relationship between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical signs of depth of anaesthesia during induction of anaesthesia by slow infusion of propofol (18 mg/kg - h).	2.305803231884196
The object of this study was to evaluate currently published data regarding extragenital neoplasia induced by HRT.	2.141601052480154
Objective: This study was designed to investigate the differences between TIVA with propofol/remifentanil (P/R) and balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F) in gynaecological laparoscopic surgery.	1.961982406201313
Emphasis was put on haemodynamic reaction, recovery profile, postoperative side effects and patient satisfaction.	2.256094802081403
Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) is a rare dermatosis of unknown aetiology.	2.486534428086896
Recent electron microscopic studies suggest that CRP is a disorder of keratinisation.	2.3321675250237903
In our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings.	2.233623071855273
CRP is generally resistant to therapy.	2.5689692826034687
We treated a 19-year-old patient with typical CRP with oral minocycline.	2.3131004844445475
Within a few weeks the eruption resolved completely.	2.3319304054787438
A mild relapse 7 months later responded promptly to a repeated course of minocycline.	1.996268123355436
Twelve months after discontinuatin of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence.	2.5306024491171635
In CRP minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects.	2.2194086592560804
Wound instillation seems to be an easy and preferable way to achieve postoperative analgesia in pediatric hernioplasty.	2.3461315248342958
This prospective, randomized and double-blinded pilot-study was initiated to gain preliminary information in order to define the appropriate concentration of local anaesthetic for efficient posthernioplastic analgesia.	2.166271844299216
The recommended infusion time for i.v.	2.2455169101222228
prostaglandin E 1 (PGE1) therapy is 2 or 3 h, depending on the dose.	2.3334073076857087
The aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate, for the first time, whether the dose of 60 µg PGE1 is effective and well tolerated with shorter infusion times.	2.2951513889943596
A total of 118 patients with intermittent claudication and a pain-free walking distance between 50 and 200 m (3 km/h, 12%) were randomized to receive an i.v.	1.8907856768302773
infusion of 3 ampoules Prostavasin (60 µg PGE1) administered for either 1 or 2 h, once a day for 4 weeks.	1.9864842800237428
Primary variables were pain-free walking distance as well as safety, determined by the frequency of adverse events and the course of blood pressure.	3.187155555274204
The efficacy was comparable in the two groups.	2.4295218963914715
In the 1-h infusion group, the pain-free walking distance increased from 87 to 135 m, and in the 2-h group from 88 to 147 m, while the absolute walking distance increased from 124 to 200 m and from 147 to 238 m, respectively.	1.9743948557871382
The differences between the two groups were not significant, although an analysis of subgroups with initial pain-free walking distances of less than 80 m indicated a significant difference in favour of the 2-h PGE1 infusion (increase in walking distance 58 m as compared with 22 m).	2.06724201473112
Course of blood pressure and frequency of adverse events were comparable in the two groups.	2.4942638872770764
Altogether, in intermittent claudication both the 1-h and the 2-h PGE1 infusion show comparably good results in terms of efficacy and safety.	2.2360896780149933
Patients with an initial pain-free walking distance of less than 80 m seem to reveal a major benefit after a 2-h PGE1 infusion.	2.0996033367396265
The problem in the treatment of deep hyalin cartilage defects is due to the minimal regeneration potential of this specific tissue.	2.694024537401234
The proliferative potential of autogenous perichondrium/periost is well-known for decades.	2.2592919807166765
Gender identity change in intersexual patients is rare.	2.264841358784537
We report on the transsexual development of a patient with male pseudohermaphroditism.	2.630427947977065
The case report emphasizes the importance of a thorough differential diagnosis.	2.4298180664161113
Fractionated irradiation with X-rays or megavoltage is an important therapeutic option in the palliative treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.	2.4608138738587164
We report on three HIV patients demonstrating bullous cutaneous eruptions in the irradiation field.	1.938268856216639
Three homosexual men (age 45-60 y) stage of disease CDC 3C, were treated with fractionated soft X-rays with the scheme conventionally used by us (total dose 30 Gy, single doses 3 Gy).	1.974398704818185
Immediately to three days after completion of treatment large blisters appeared within the irradiation field, resolving after 2-4 weeks, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.	2.0485129260780144
The cause of this rare reaction to soft X-ray therapy, potentially suggesting an individually altered radiation sensitivity, is so far unknown.	2.1795730295578117
Controlled prospective studies applying different fractionation schemes will be necessary to better elucidate this issue.	2.092363644578595
Due to the decreased trauma in anterior as well as posterior surgical approaches to the spine, microsurgical techniques have been used more frequently in recent years.	2.5816930612958795
This article describes two new microsurgical techniques to approach the anterior lumbar spine for interbody fusion as part of a posterior-anterior stabilization concept in various diseases like spondylolisthesis, degenerative instability; failed back surgery syndrome, fractures etc.	1.7607453724593056
The lumbar segments L 2-5 are approached through a blunt muscle-splitting retroperitoneal technique.	2.0221211031158783
The antero-lateral circumference of the motion segment is exposed with a frame-type retractor which is anchored in the adjacent vertebral bodies with anchoring screws.	1.8341624594707049
The lumbosacral junction is exposed via a mini-laparotomy using a special soft tissue spreader.	1.9823084307585779
Interbody fusion is described with autogeneous bone grafts.	2.398947314092601
Preliminary experience with 83 patients treated between 1995 and 1996 show that peri- and postoperative morbidity is low.	2.2977988514352097
Clinical as well as radiological results are comparable to the standard techniques.	3.062826230753713
Spectrum as well as rate of complications so far do not differ from those described in the literature for non-microsurgical approaches.	2.8086765617607887
The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint.	2.8958532735525497
Its origin is at the lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle and the insertion is located in the posterior part of the intercondylar area.	2.8665706628926424
From a functional point of view, one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur.	2.004986701980833
These fibers become tense when the knee is flexed.	2.0840479847056455
The posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended.	2.1716115527494053
The main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type I collagen positive dense connective tissue.	2.596346426955158
The longitudinal fibrils of type I collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type III collagen positive fibrils.	1.9640684472734369
In this region, the structure of the tissue resembles fibrocartilage.	2.5797574595510713
Oval-shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils.	2.0605647379339396
The femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral apophyseal enthesis.	2.290217862405635
Near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia there should be various mechanoreceptors which might have an important function for the kinematics of the knee joint.	2.119764497062923
The blood supply of the PCL arises from the middle geniculate artery.	2.239733233911214
The ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a periligamentous network.	2.07519742041087
From the synovial sheath, the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a transverse direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	1.863427245087564
The distribution of blood vessels within the PCL is not homogeneous.	2.2012418284625506
We detected three avascular areas within the ligament: Both fibrocartilaginous entheses of the PCL are devoid of blood vessels.	1.9211716358889124
A third avascular zone is located in the central zone of fibrocartilage of the middle third region.	2.274623141732858
Atrial reentrant tachycardias (ART) are a potentially life-threatening complication in survivors of congenital heart disease surgery.	2.242175884879945
From July 1993 to December 1997, temporary transesophageal pacing was used to convert 29 tachycardia episodes in 19 patients.	2.1199904261433327
At the time of the first tachycardia episode, patients' ages were 1 month to 26 years (mean 9.8 yrs).	2.184273571553265
Time from operation to onset of first tachycardia episode ranged from 1 day to 19 years.	2.1299895012863836
Onset was within the first 2 weeks postoperatively in 6 patients and occurred later in 13 patients (1 to 19 years after operation).	2.357940327616124
Postoperative pacemaker implantation had been performed in 2 pts; 17 of 19 pts were receiving antiarrhythmic medication.	2.176563119550841
After placing a quadripolar transesophageal catheter, atrial and ventricular signals were recorded and atrial stimulation performed.	1.980172397874357
Atrial cycle length of tachycardia ranged from 160-380 ms with 1:1 to 4:1 AV conduction.	1.9654059293642991
Temporary transesophageal pacing was performed following an algorithm starting with 4 extrastimuli (20 ms below atrial cycle length of tachycardia).	1.8756294098855422
Tachycardia terminated in 27 of 29 cases (93%) without complications.	2.2556539424437605
In 3 cases, conversion was achieved by pacing after amiodarone 5 mg/kg i.v.	2.247899769665218
After tachycardia conversion, sinus- or pacemaker rhythm was present in 20 cases.	2.1837554476274756
In 9 cases atrial fibrillation was recorded; spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm occurred after a maximum of 3 min (7 cases) or persisted and required direct current cardioversion (2 cases).	1.991005644476707
In conclusion, transesophageal atrial pacing is an effective, relatively noninvasive method for conversion of atrial reentrant tachycardias after operation for congenital heart disease.	1.9873634897082044
After elucidating the components and theory of neuroticism (N) as well as of psychosomatic complaints and their relationships to personality dimensions and to psychosomatic diseases, comparisons are performed between patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) or related pain diseases with healthy subjects scoring high on personality dimensions related to neuroticism.	1.8940181086033911
FMS and pain patients score high on depression, anxiety, and experience of stress although questionnaire scores on depression are higher in subjects not exhibiting somatic features of the disease.	2.0055681615640117
High subjective pain sensitivity and low thresholds for pain perception are also common features in high N subjects and FMS patients.	1.9294165628314535
On the endocrinological level cortisol responses to challenge tests with CRH as well as prolactin responses to TRH are higher in FMS patients than in high N healthy subjects indicating an endocrinological difference.	1.9475791376976717
A common feature, however, is the lack of adapatability in the two groups, since neurotics are in particular characterized by a low capacity to shift their behavior from one state to the other (waking-sleeping, working-relaxing), to re-adapt to baseline levels after endocrinological or physiological stress responses, or to adjust to conditions of shift work.	1.9616768842263463
Purpose: To document our experience with spiral hydro-CT of the pancreas based on a combination of pharmacologic intestinal paralysis and water distension of the stomach and duodenum with specific reference to tumor detection rate, differentiation of malignant versus benign tumors and assessment of tumor resectability in a prospective study on 211 consecutive patients.	2.1179005018715786
Since the publication of a case of Syphilis transmission by blood transfusion in 1915 the discussion about transfusion-associated bacterial infection is ongoing.	2.098406331146109
For some time, virus infections through blood and blood products have been highlighted.	2.095460589803719
However, in the last years the attention required has been drawn to the problem of transmission of bacteria.	2.5356300137650756
In this publication the present situation concerning the contamination rates through blood components and the frequency of transfusion-associated microbial infections is outlined.	1.9457915725533625
The bacteria involved are discussed.	2.498978293605942
While working to develop a distal locking device, we analyzed distal nail position with reference to nail deformation and a radiographic-morphometric investigation.	2.0534887559158777
The amount and the direction of implant deformation in unslotted stainless steel unreamed tibial nails (Synthes) were analyzed.	1.9760850721212984
Measurement of implant deformation (3 translations, 3 angles) in the center of the distal transverse locking hole was performed with a 3D magnetic motion tracker system before and after nail insertion.	2.2306734595687874
Unreamed tibial nails (diameter 8 mm, n = 10; diameter 9 mm, n = 10) were inserted in paired human cadaver tibiae.	2.085150689425025
The results showed lateral translations of -4.5+/-3.5 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 14.3 mm) and dorsal translations of -7.8+/-5.8 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 19.2 mm).	1.7747128658842495
Rotational deformations around the longitudinal axis of the nail were 0.3+/-0.7 ° (mean and standard deviation, range 2.4 °).	2.0363177309193663
The results showed, that a simple aiming arm, mounted on the proximal nail end, alone or even in combination with a large working channel (e.g.	1.995243612588726
10 mm in diameter), was not adequate to the aiming process.	2.488942673782769
A radiographic-morphometric analysis was subsequently performed in 40 tibiae after experimental (n = 20) or clinical (n = 20) implantation of nails 8 mm and 9 mm in diameter.	2.0013305330180278
These measurements showed a relatively constant distance between the upper distal transverse hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia (average 12.3 mm and only a narrow range (7.6 mm).	1.9010449646386423
These data were the basis for the development of an aiming technique that exploits the relatively constant distance between the distal nail hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia.	2.2264290881418205
The goal of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Aging (ILSE) is to assess healthy and satisfying aging in middle adulthood and later life.	1.8111021049551417
In addition, this study compares adults from eastern and western Germany.	2.1226617605963365
The data for this study were collected between late 1993 and early 1996 as part of the first measurement point of the ILSE.	2.529251319145033
Five-hundred and one participants from the Leipzig region were compared with 500 participants from the Heidelberg area on four specific dimensions: personality, cognitive functioning, subjective well-being, and health.	1.9436982280611732
Age differences were obtained for neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.	2.094929441880392
Differences were also obtained in cognitive functioning and health.	2.254857246676791
Regional differences between eastern and western Germany were obtained in the personality dimensions neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.	2.185567850925091
Significant age by region interactions were obtained for openness and some of the cognitive measures, as well as for the physicians' health ratings of the participants, suggesting selective historical effects.	2.1196369309739365
The results are discussed with respect to functional abilities and levels of satisfaction in midlife, as well as with respect to regional differences that might be due to prior political system differences in the east and west.	2.3584328021316723
Modern obstetrics must try to maintain high safety standards for both mother and child and, at the same time, satisfy the general desire of women for natural birth.	2.0377545091568106
Standards of safety are based on early recognition of high risks, allowing early intervention to prevent serious complications.	2.230326793771418
A considerable number of diagnostic and therapeutic measures recommended on a prophylactic basis and therefore widely used are responsible for the medical-technical image associated with modern obstetrics.	2.156475168300741
The benefits of most of these prophylactically recommended activities are unproven or low relative to the unavoidable side effects and the costs associated with widespread application.	2.023836715862841
There is good scientific proof that routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring during labor and delivery is associated with an increase in the rate of cesarean sections as well as operative vaginal deliveries without any clear benefit to the newborn in terms of a decrease in mortality or morbidity.	2.411365480288979
In a population of healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, the prevalence of perinatal mortality or morbidity is so low that even with meta-analysis of several studies the numbers remain too small to show significant differences for these rare events.	1.9869172897567684
In high-risk cases the routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring throughout labor and delivery is undisputed and leads to a significant drop in morbiditiy and mortality of the baby.	2.2432168949180653
With careful selection of pregnant women a combination of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and auscultation during certain segments of the first stage of labor provides adequate surveillance.	2.1495835509587646
We report the history of a 38 year old patient who began to develop mental deterioration at the age of 26.	2.592271460798581
After a time of 7 years neurological signs like writing dystonia occured.	2.228639106725684
Hallervorden-Spatz-Desease (HSD) was diagnosed at the age of 36 in vivo with the clinical presentation of severe dystonia, rigidity, dementia, and typical signal loss in the globus-pallidus the reticular part of the substantia nigra, and the nucleus ruber in the T-2 weighted MRI.	2.0960106370687996
The "eye-of-the-tiger"-sign, a bilateral hyperintensity in the rostral globus pallidus, was not observed in follow-up examinations.	2.264331443901465
HSD is a rare autosomal-recessive or sporadic disease of unknown etiology.	2.5283995194953612
In one third of the patients a dementing process is the first clinical sign of the disorder, and is a rare differential diagnosis of early onset dementia.	3.1900414593421313
In 33 patients with chronic venous incompetence (CVI) caused by primary varicoses or postthrombotic syndrome stage I-III (according to Widmer) the therapeutic benefit of 6 months of medically supervised physical exercise training was documented.	2.090841524385268
During the training penud there was an improvement in subjective complains such as pain and tendency for edema in the legs.	2.086276543714064
Mobility in the upper ankle joint was improved asuss as venous drainage function.	2.342919425874854
Clinical benefit was achieved in the reduction of ulcer size; 7 of 10 ulcers completely healed.	2.3991093182763463
Medically supervised physical exercise training and optimized compression therapy are basic therapeutic approaches in conservative treatment in chronic venous insufficiency.	2.1301720835977096
Costs are covered by the patient's health insurance company in Germany, as long as the exercise training is medically supervised.	2.3257388871731823
Epileptic seizures may alter autonomic functions.	2.4048898136959385
This is especially the case with complex focal seizures (of temporal lobe origin) and grand mal.	1.9957964263579597
Most frequently, such seizures cause ictal tachycardia, sometimes tachypnea, probably caused by the propagation of epileptic discharges to autonomic cerebral structures.	1.9290403775508058
Ictal bradycardia and asystole are rare phenomena.	2.357958169664404
However, they may be life threatening.	2.697068683390581
Their differentiation from primary cardiac arrest is possible by the use of ictal EEG and ECG registration.	2.4236494997502143
Postictal serum prolactin measurement does not differentiate syncope from seizure.	2.117445627496205
However, a postictal increase of creatine kinase is only measured after epileptic seizures and not after syncope.	1.8543435640755384
Treatment of such epileptic seizures includes an optimization of anticonvulsant drug therapy and the implantation of a cardiac demand stimulator.	2.2063835323975853
There is growing evidence that ictal asystole is a cofactor in sudden unexplained death in epileptic patients.	1.8703595472310353
A minimal documentation system (MIDOS) has been developed for self-assessment of pain and other symptoms by the patients on palliative care units.	2.3557649800373093
To decrease the administrative burden and thereby increase the acceptance of the system an electronic database was developed to facilitate data entry and documentation.	2.0482264653591282
Background: Hearing loss can be found in more than 50% of children with Down syndrome.	2.6147375402328485
Chronic or recurrent middle-ear effusions are considered the most frequent etiology with an incidence of 60%.	2.449287604664507
Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare semimalignant cutaneous neoplasm characterised by slow but locally aggressive growth.	2.3054167250381004
Its histogenesis and nomenclature are still a subject of controversy.	2.3598130393924794
Under-recognition and the tumour's bland cytologic features lead to frequent misdiagnoses.	1.9522278337859293
In addition, subclinical tumour invasion explains the high incidence of local recurrence.	2.2884964060677433
Thus, the tumour makes great demands on the planning of its surgical removal.	2.1416545312353317
We report the case of an 81-year-old woman with a microcystic adnexal carcinoma of the lower lip, which was treated by micrographic surgery.	2.6209701806449175
On the basis of this case, differential diagnoses, histogenesis and micrographic surgery as the treatment of choice are discussed.	2.488852215404838
In old age, individualization processes also simultaneously effect the opportunity and necessity to shape one's life.	1.8916793330857036
Societal orientation dissipates, and the certainties of earlier times disappear.	2.628828278089875
Plurality and option appear as an increasing twofold challenge to coping with life.	2.0874324316663637
These ambiguities characterize modern old age.	2.362292383530712
Or in other words: the biographization of old age has begun.	2.265920215541608
Posttraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with a poor outcome.	2.634921140526638
When evaluating the literature according to the Utstein method, there were only 2 survivors (0.18%) out of 1,135 CPR attempts after trauma (Table 1).	2.1038926590268106
Differences in the study populations and levels of prehospital trauma care led us to analyse the results of a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system in Cologne.	2.318067958346446
From January 1987 to December 1990, a total of 49,054 emergency calls were registered using a standardised protocol.	2.137915030322718
Among 9,595 trauma-related calls, 636 patients were found to be pulseless on arrival of the emergency team, 412 of these were pronounced dead.	2.017045269844346
CPR was initiated in the remaining 224 patients, who comprise the study population (defined as 100%).	2.3223154319490593
All patients who were admitted to a hospital were followed using a second protocol.	2.454639568453182
CPR in the field was successful in 68 (30.4%) patients, who were then admitted to a hospital; 42 of these died within the first 24 h. Four patients (1.8%) could be discharged from hospital alive and were still living 1 year later, 1 with a lasting neurological deficit (Fig.	2.212358700444453
Even in a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system, the chance of surviving a post-traumatic cardiac arrest is minimal.	2.0654825139359154
Survival has to be regarded as an individual fate; the overall results are discouraging.	2.633177345383755
Even though this study analyses the largest population of posttraumatic CPR ever published, prognostic factors could not be identified due to the few survivors.	2.270676619316933
Nevertheless, the result does not justify general omission of CPR after trauma as: (1) prognostic factors for survival have not been identified thus far; and (2) no significant additional costs arise from posttraumatic CPR.	2.0910003123511123
Functional voiding disturbances can be due to failure of the detrusor or to discoordinated sphincter function during micturition.	2.2305600959419105
In a brief survey mechanical, pedagogical, electrotherapeutical, and surgical measures as well as drug treatment are critically examined.	2.294053209514784
Conservative methods should always be attempted before surgical procedures are performed.	2.4571223071146924
Depending on the degree of severity and the etiology of the disease, a combined therapy can be useful.	3.000672514900299
In the case of resistance to therapy, intermittent autocatheterism is to be preferred to permanent deviation via an indwelling catheter.	2.2027871199160463
During long-term therapy of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol (300 mg/d) two patients developed generalized granuloma annulare.	2.2965912146715466
The diagnoses were confirmed by histology; concomitant diseases, especially diabetes mellitus, were not detectable.	2.2667014389845503
Following discontinuation of allopurinol therapy, cutaneous granulomas healed without relapse.	2.1077524786532944
Hyperuricaemia could be controlled by low-purine diet and medication avoiding allopurinol.	2.1642507460888263
The clinical history of our two patients suggested a causal connection between allopurinol therapy and generalized granuloma annulare.	2.009711763962431
For this reason we rate the development of this disease in both cases as a rare but significant side effect of allopurinol.	2.7130715526269595
This should give rise to critical assessment of concomitant drug therapy during development of generalized granuloma annulare.	1.9917141385729709
Intraarticular bleeding and muscle bleeding occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma in hemophilia A or B.	2.2761905504751243
The most common sites for hemarthrosis are the knees joints, elbows and ankles joints.	1.92970539771492
Resorption of intraarticular blood induces reactive hemophilic synovitis.	2.2225647881541106
Hyperplasia of the synovium can be followed by recurrent bleedings.	2.5201491028247682
These early reactions can change to a chronic synovitis and cause cartilage damage, finally resulting in a complete destruction of the joint.	2.264282331111736
Since 1981 158 adults and 61 children with a hemophilia A or B were treated at the Center for hemophilic disorders Frankfurt in an interdisciplinary approach.	1.9716889864048848
Consequent prophylactic treatment with factor substitution can prevent the incidence of severe hemarthrosis.	2.499008623707781
Minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution, temporarily non-weight bearing of the extremity, application of ice-packs and physical therapy.	2.030009011105757
More severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis.	2.6814012963205713
This is followed by a consequent physical therapy (joint and soft tissue techniques) and anti-inflammatory drugs.	2.1866661223521326
The goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint, the improvement of the coordination, and the proprioception.	2.952388198672502
The chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions.	2.0982877560697357
Local ice application, sytemic and local anti-inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy.	2.171260709965186
Soft heel shock absorber, elastic and semi-rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement.	1.7645931111787925
Synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis.	3.1889565730019234
Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO), which is an alternative in certain cases, has been performed with great success in 12 cases in our hospital.	2.707374914082488
In advanced arthropathy joint mobilization should be the emphasis of the physical therapy.	2.3632411388897037
Bandages, crutches and ortopaedic shoe devices improve the walking capacity.	2.0311604838680117
Over an 18-month period findings of stress X-ray of the ankle and medical records of 112 cases were analyzed retrospectively as to indications, results and therapeutic consequences.	2.148452492900145
The analysis showed that critical setting of indications can reduce the frequency of stress X-ray of the ankle and thus lower the total costs.	2.402048258862865
The introduction of guidelines could be advantageous at medical training institutions.	2.033474182855884
A 72-year-old patient received 0.1 mg morphine by the intrathecal route and 2x1.5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy.	2.092929578484043
Severe respiratory depression and somnolence supervened 3.5 h later, which lasted over the next 24 h and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.	1.9729748743182802
Continuous administration of >6 mg naloxone to antagonize the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect.	2.0933334827318255
The patient's condition was not normalized until a single dose of 0.3 mg flumazenil was administered.	2.0231887304836507
For the time being, especially in the case of elderly patients, we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than 0.1 mg morphine is given.	2.2857892211366813
Respiration should be monitored for quite some time.	2.5058355293945938
In contrast to the often debated NYHA classification, the determination of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) by cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows an objective assessment of the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).	2.1793221220988253
However, cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a time consuming and costly diagnostic tool, which requires sophisticated equipment and specially trained personell.	2.035664098934541
Exercise capacity can also be determined by the 6 minute walk test.	2.8094986991102586
This test simply measures the distance covered by strong walking on a hallway level within 6 minutes.	1.8960989487657738
The 6 minute walk test is a submaximal exercise test, which is associated with much smaller increments in heart rate, blood pressure and plasma catecholamines than cardiopulmonary exercise testing.	2.372101356042392
It is characterized by a very small intraindividual variance.	2.453387050398216
Furthermore, it can be easily performed and, due to low logistic and personal requirements, it is very cost effective.	2.6334323666342945
The results of the 6 minute walk test - as well as of cardiopulmonary exercise testing - are influenced by extracardial exercise-limiting disorders, such as pulmonary diseases.	2.3172127921537817
Independent from the etiology of CHF, the results of the 6 minute walk test are closely related to peak VO2.	2.443961546203308
Like peak VO2 the 6 minute walk test has been shown to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in CHF, with its predictive value being independent from left ventricular ejection fraction and other potential prognostic parameters.	2.180571323523563
In CHF patients a walking distance < 300 m is associated with a one-year-mortality of up to 50%, whereas the one-year-mortality in patients reaching a walking distance > 450 m amounts to only a few percent.	2.7165506082742383
In addition, the hospitalization rate of patients reaching a walking distance of < 300 m is several fold higher than in those with a walking distance >= 450 m. Like cardiopulmonary exercise testing, the 6 minute walk test allows to control the efficiency of specific treatments and to monitor the natural course of the disease.	1.9422110719620311
The 6 minute walk test is, thus, a cost effective alternative to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in CHF patients.	2.2323828087103057
However, neither the 6 minute walk test alone nor the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing alone are sufficient for selecting patients, e.g., for cardiac transplantation, as each individual case requires a synopsis of all relevant facts and parameters.	2.0598300140583663
We report the first case of prurigo pigmentosa in the German literature.	2.337889539803814
For over a year, a 16-year old white girl developed an immensely pruritic symmetrical reticular, papulo-vesicular eruption on the trunk, axillae and pubic region.	1.9358838968538077
Histologically a superficial  perivascular spongiotic and lichenoid  inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed.	1.8827963130073326
Systemic corticosteroids and diaminophenylsulphone (DADPS) produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences.	1.9755603239956483
Healing  occurred only after 4 weeks of systemic- minocycline.	2.3741777089027596
Following parenteral administration, clonidine has analgesic effects at both cerebral and spinal levels.	1.9952124628982775
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) makes it possible to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations.	1.8983045363259416
Therefore, we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery.	2.436833856556152
The effects of glycerol are discussed in detail.	2.325142678293803
Glycerol can lead to a transition of crystalline lipid structures within the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.	2.1509337432386304
Especially if applied in oil/water-emulsions it improves, the hydration of the horny layers better than urea.	1.8873896284053686
In addition, if facilitates the dissolution of desmosomes within the superior layers of the horny layer enhancing desquamation.	1.899016761465328
Furthermore, by using glycerol, the mechanical properties of the skin can be influenced; long term used leads to increased elasticity.	2.3252779170235702
The roughness of the horny layer is reduced, which can be explained by the abrasive and/or the hydrating effect.	2.5216441490910997
Glycerol used in o/w-emulsions also protects against the influence of tensides or noxious lipophilic agents.	2.0134864898727405
Presumably a flux from the base of the epidermis towards its surface triggers the regeneration of the barrier.	2.1360092968172224
Finally,  glycerol can lead - similarly to urea - to an improvement in active agent penetration, as has been proven for hexylnicotinate.	1.9937111923751851
Background: An 18-year-old woman presented with thyrotoxic symptoms - right sided lid retraction and exophthalmus.	2.1694311783073665
She complained of diplopia on lateral gaze.	2.273099193960768
Laboratory investigations confirmed Grave's disease with hyperthyroidism and TSH receptor antibodies.	2.0086164212561632
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.	2.7361998365456435
The safe and effective treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias is being intensively studied.	2.5861002736578422
Internal electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has been shown to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment option.	2.7437671446945027
Thus, mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to ventricular defibrillation.	2.3290312858372
Further studies are needed to determine whether cardioversion mechanisms differ for chronic atrial fibrillation compared to acute atrial fibrillation.	2.0390425064613757
Plasmocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow, typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia, proteinuria, anemia and hypercalcemia.	2.2044816797846063
In its progress, deposits of amyloids in  almost all organs can be observed.	2.225899561114165
However, plasmacytomas which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare.	1.9920274898606052
This case report presents a 61-year-old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations.	2.4406335434785076
A biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light-chain type, which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with lambda light-chains stage II after Durie and Salmon.	2.1918034188586653
In the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro-enteric system.	2.2523134721208766
Macroglossia as a primary manifestation of plasmacytoma is rarely described in medical literature.	2.2860654970797896
However, reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known.	2.243667190467941
Aim: Improved detection of pulmonary-venous pathologies by imaging the pulmonary veins without arterial overlay.	2.0236311981386623
For the histological verification of suspicious non-palpable small breast tumors, the three-dimensional breast biopsy applied as cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system is the optimal solution at present.	1.9912468995622972
Because of the possibility of performing mammography during the operation, errors of localization can be corrected and incorrect incisions avoided.	2.155045723909099
Taking the three radiomorphologically leading symptoms into consideration - suspicious microcalcification, focal shadow and structural irregularity - it can be stated that the digital mammography of the ABBI system is more sensitive than the conventional one for detecting microcalcification, but focal shadow and structural irregularity are detected less well by digital technique.	1.7246982194897866
These structures should be preoperatively marked by using sonography.	2.266098708386365
After the complete removal of suspicious microcalcification checked by digital mammography during the operation, residual tumor might be found in a second excision when histologically invasive or intraductal tumor terminations reach the excision margin (R1 resection).	1.9326645419861157
Thirteen invasive and 8 intraductal carcinomas were found in 80 cases of cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system.	2.139709390458936
In 7 procedures carried out to exclude an in-breast recurrence, 3 intraductal carcinomas and 1 invasive carcinoma were observed.	2.044061880991921
In 8 of 12 invasive carcinomas and in 1 of 5 intraductal carcinomas, breast-conserving therapy was indicated.	2.1151043817498527
Two cases of invasive carcinoma fulfilled the criteria applied (minimal tumor-free margin > 2 mm, no extensive intraductal component) to use the ABBI cylinder as lumpectomy without a second excision to follow.	1.925053318433933
With the increasing number of patients surviving after therapeutic intervention for congenital heart disease (CHD), accurate and frequent follow-up of their morphologic and functional cardiovascular status is required, preferably with a noninvasive imaging technique.	2.1753545415160866
In a retrospecitve multicenter study we followed-up 30 fractures of the neck of the femur in children aged 11 years (1.5-15 years) for 4.8 years (0.5-20.0 years).	2.196458187737779
It is the aim of this study to analyse factors possibly related to outcome, like age at injury, type of fracture, interval between injury and treatment, method of stabilization and postoperative interval until full weight bearing.	2.0147689073403705
At follow-up subjective parameters (pain, weather sensitiveness), clinical parameters (range of motion, claudication, leg length discrepancies) and radiological parameters (hip series) were investigated and medical charts and roentgenograms were reviewed using a standardized protocol.	2.037091444187428
29 of 30 children (96.7 %) have sustained displaced fractures.	2.1575856872351205
Non-operative treatment has been applied in 4 children.	2.5020697425764977
26 femoral neck fractures (type I: 1, type II: 8, type III: 17) were stabilized by internal fixation using screws and/or pins.	2.3565352800909385
Following non-operative treatment one child suffered a coxa vara and another child suffered a avascular femoral head necrosis in combination with coxa vara and leg length shortening of 4 cm.	2.1425608124363027
Following operative treatment 9 of 26 children (34.6 %) sufferred a avascular femoral head necrosis and 3 children (11.5 %) suffered a coxa vara.	1.9163894533329364
In 6 of 26 children (23 %) we observed leg length discrepancies > 2 cm.	2.198985645918153
We were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differencies between the groups of children who have sustained type II or type III fractures, or between the groups of children aged < 10 years when compared to children aged > 10 years, or between the group of children who were operated on within 6 hours after the accident when compared to the group of children operated > 6 hours after the accident.	2.2421668700079653
We observed no significant follow-up result differences between the groups of children who had different intervals between operation and full weight bearing.	2.260935108342735
Operative fracture management remains the treatment of choice in the majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in children.	2.73047705983327
However, in our limited study we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differences between the group of children treated by immediate open reduction and internal fixation (interval injury - operation < 6 hours) when compared to children who had been operated > 6 hours after the injury.	2.2026122172209184
Evidence based standards for structure quality in out-patient management of chronic pain states do not exist.	2.235667160491518
Therefore we tried to evaluate if german standards for outpatient management of chronic pain states which are based on opinions of experts for pain management influence the outcome quality of independent physicians for treatment of chronic low back pain.	2.282748443137816
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare low dose dopamine and dopexamine with respect to of liver-venous oxygen saturation, oxygen delivery and - demand, liver function tests and cardiocirculatory effects  in the reperfusion period during a hemihepatectomy operation with occlusion of the liver hilus.	2.1173614541526913
Facial trauma is frequent and mainly caused by motor vehicle accidents.	2.2186595210711877
Due to this main etiologic factor, trauma to the facial skeleton is often associated with serious injuries, commonly involving the brain, chest or abdomen.	1.9904691908306529
As a consequence, the initial clinical management of these patients includes control of hemorrhage and immediate assessment of life-threatening injuries, including the maintenance of the airways.	2.430532708767831
Patients presenting with facial trauma are initially evaluated with a systematic clinical examination because many fractures can be accurately diagnosed by inspection and palpation alone.	1.8486248837482178
In these cases plain film radiographs serve only for confirmation and documentation of the diagnosis.	2.165533440255652
In many other cases accompanying and extensive soft tissue swelling may clinically obscure fractures.	1.9432635521650103
A complete and accurate evaluation of these patients requires additional radiological imaging methods.	2.3964737827125417
A series of plain films may be generally sufficient but in most of the cases they can be regarded as initial screening methods for more thorough diagnosis with computed tomography (CT).	2.3531478283899188
In trauma patients CT is the imaging method of choice because it shows more fracture lines and displaced fragments than any other imaging modality.	2.0881471735848476
CT delineates soft tissue and bony structures and can localize and even characterize foreign bodies.	2.1483504385717933
A complete and accurate characterization of the fracture type and potentially associated complications is mandatory for the appropriate treatment and can only be achieved by careful radiological (CT) evaluation.	2.3606962346443474
On the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds, surgery rates and small-area variations within the catchment area of the AOK Magdeburg were examined for the year 1997.	1.9987439422328697
Substantial variation can be constantly seen.	2.4051756954959718
The extremal quotient at the 30 most frequent ICPM groups ranged from 2 to 5.	1.9984121674627513
Generally, the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute.	2.24595329590546
Criteria for hospital admission and indications for surgery should be made explicit.	2.525058671970738
Between 1984 and 1994 the legally required task force "Advisory Committee to the German Federal Health Office in Matters of Approval and Review of Existing Medicines B3-Psychiatry, Neurology, Anesthesiology" analyzed and evaluated the CNS-active compounds that until then had only possessed a fictitious registration.	1.5880471871437918
The evaluation was related to efficacy and safety within the indications claimed by the producers.	2.228169951872288
Reviews and monographies had to be established for 445 basic compounds.	2.6076392383038143
One hundred positive and 30 negative monographies were published.	2.1905446776764936
"Negative" indicates that none of the claimed indications could be accepted by the committee.	2.2258704628471184
It is regrettable that the Federal Health Agency did not notice a considerable part of these negative evaluations until the present date.	1.856774962078258
The process of the "Aufbereitung" was stopped abruptly by the 5th amendment of the German Drug Law in August 1994, - a very doubtful political decision with respect to drug safety in this country.	2.0504662542640504
Only a few prospective studies which are appropriately designed to prove a putative correlation have been published.	2.090572946414846
A critical review of these studies and some case reports, in the light of the current pathophysiological concepts of multiple sclerosis, does not indicate a causal relationship between physical trauma and onset of multiple sclerosis or exacerbations.	2.3410742531026085
We report on unusual presentation forms of Pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with AIDS.	2.4886912313296023
A 36-years-old woman presented a cavitation in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x-ray.	2.2741088479635017
The biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on.	2.650620052003874
The surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells, focal recent and older hemorrhages, rests of fibrinous exudate and dystrophic calcifications.	1.6820299645024874
In the surrounding tissue there were Pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls, this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change.	1.9821565920609259
A cytomegalic virus infection was also found.	2.58786931096608
In aortic atresia, coronary perfusion normally occurs through retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta.	2.2179164046442175
We report on two patients with antegrade flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	1.9666155709871302
While no other way of left atrial or ventricular decompression was found, echocardiography, angiography and the post-mortem examination showed left ventricular to coronary sinusoids as the sole pathway for systemic oxygenation.	1.920291552779978
In a second patient with complex congenital heart disease, including aortic atresia, antegrade flow in the ascending aorta was through a left coronary fistula with shunt flow originating from the pulmonary trunc.	2.020361184610006
This report describes systemic perfusion depending on retrograde coronary flow due to coronary-cameral (sinusoids) and coronary arterio-venous fistulas leading to the phenomenon of antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	1.8181789433278783
The introduction of biosensor technology for near bedside measurement of plasma lactate concentrations has been a promising step for critical care profiling.	1.9178811179183892
However, methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported.	2.1533914532857223
With the advent of a new biosensor (Chiron Diagnostics) and a revised NOVA Biomedical device, accuracy was expected to be improved.	2.140235400420904
The goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods.	2.8621837385459825
The combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three-dimensional bone architecture.	2.0823728042383567
Microcomputed tomography avoids the time-consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections.	2.1804130628977587
Furthermore, its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 mm.	2.0668313565935335
Thus, three-dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone.	2.2313873464902945
The aneurysmal bone cyst represents a tumorlike lesion, which does not occur frequently.	2.2496662054350742
Every site of the skeleton may be involved.	2.839271435287134
Although it can be observed at any age, it distinctly predominates from 10 to 20 years of age.	2.4164472371974672
Distinction of aneurysmatic bone cysts from certain benign or malignant bone tumours requires subtle imaging techniques and an experienced bone tumour pathologist.	1.9276783760629288
Since the lesion shows a heterogeneous biological behaviour and typically occurs in the growing skeleton, a wide range of surgical procedures must be provided concerning tumour resection and defect reconstruction.	2.075948553519623
In the current retrospective study results of 41 surgically treated aneurysmal bone cysts, thereof 5 latent, 31 active, and 5 aggressive lesions, were investigated.	1.911051022927355
While morbidity due to the therapeutic measures was comparatively low even in extended lesions and demanding reconstructions, a recurrence rate of 19.5% had to be observed in our series.	2.385918522822453
Taking into consideration the biological activity of the lesion, analysis of the recurrences revealed inappropriate surgical margins had been chosen at the primary operation in all of these patients.	2.377033118514302
Since the risk of a local relapse is linked both to aggressiveness of the primary lesion and to surgical radicality, therapy of aneurysmal bone cyst requires preoperative staging and stage-dependent surgical procedures.	2.0971468392157457
The RS3PE syndrome (Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Edema) is a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly with a good prognosis.	2.2504690870976813
It usually presents as an acute, symmetric polysynovitis with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet.	2.065277361001659
Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement.	2.2341627540530027
We describe the case of an 81 year old man with a primarily unilateral manifestation involving the right hand.	2.311375859482861
A thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected.	2.6927896441160843
Within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand.	2.4076482393701504
Movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful.	2.3613728778398597
Low-dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms.	2.4898718419149803
The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness, safety and acceptance of a new technique of percutaneous implantation of port-catheter-systems (PIPS) for locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy of the liver.	2.159993102507383
From October 1994 to July 1996, 128 patients (30 women, 98 men) participated in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program (phase II).	1.9239977861312187
Our objectives were to demonstrate risk-factor modification and increased work-load capacity resulting directly from the rehabilitation in terms of primary results and long-term effects, 6 months (n = 59) and 12 months (n = 30) after termination of the program.	2.311226738689815
We observed how many of the patients were able to be occupationally re-integrated after completion of phase II rehabilitation.	2.52833428065787
Here, we present the so-called "Vollmer retractor", which can be fixed on to the operating table.	2.5466891857937166
It allows an optimal transference of the traction force on to the border of the wound, both in upper and lower abdominal interventions.	1.9769789359706975
In this way, as shown by our recent experience, we gain an optimal view of the subdiaphragmatic area and into the small pelvis.	2.070976989067171
The disaster management in Germany is embodied in the constitution.	2.334264808988076
According to the German constitution the ministries of the interior of the federal states coordinate the disaster management by delegating it to the city and county administrations.	1.766524158666617
These elaborate and update a special disaster management calendar, which allows a prompt flow of information to and from the administration and the person in charge of operations and guarantees a smooth collaboration on which the success of the operation depends.	1.9622240874231212
Pathophysiologically, ARDS is characterized by pulmonary edema owing to injury of the capillary-alveolar membranes and increased pulmonary artery pressure.	2.248394980473155
It is further distinguished by severe hypoxemia unresponsive to the usual methods of support for respiratory failure.	1.9256854365251688
Another characteristic feature in ARDS is the low thoracopulmonary compliance.	2.281489761548343
Latest studies suggest that the incidence of the syndrome is in the range of 3-10 cases / 100,000 inhabitants / year.	2.7369708503897843
Mortality rates are a major concern: old and new reports continue to report mortality rates of 50-60%.	2.24574013735729
Thoracic organ transplantation has evolved as standard therapy in end-stage cardiac and pulmonary failure.	2.255855570813266
Meanwhile more than 50.000 heart, 2500 heart-lung and 10.000 lung transplantations have been performed worldwide.	2.04815471064198
Improvements in patient selection as well as in the postoperative management have led to 1-year survival rates of 70-90%.	2.9802939495603
Long-term results are still influenced by the development of graft vessels disease, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and malignancies.	2.436869841319057
Furthermore, indications and results of different procecures will be presented and new developments discussed.	2.3424973122041184
The paper focuses on the cultural history of brain death in Germany in the second half of the 20th century.	2.4758800458949963
It analyzes scientific and public discourses on the relevance of brain death and the importance of medical innovations in intensive care medicine.	2.2953087403366697
The paper examines how the public reacted when heart transplantation led to an urgent need for a new definition of death.	2.120670409372703
It will be shown how the concept of brain death was accepted by the public, introduced into clinical routine, and implemented through medical and legal policies.	2.2071760424441447
Finally, it will be analyzed why the public consensus on brain death was definitely questioned in the last ten years.	2.083575478261959
Background: In the course of Graves' disease (GD) the extraocular muscles become fibrotic after an acute inflammatory stage.	2.1097480147407275
Differentiation of these two stages is important for therapy.	2.8679445367651644
Injuries of the joints of the pelvis and of the acetabulum are still a problem even today.	2.7878693363840097
The lethality, the overall gravity of the injuries, the probability of haemorrhagic complications and the proportion of associated pelvic injuries are also increased.	2.1805170842111905
Even when anatomical reconstruction of the lower limb girdle is achieved, long-term secondary conditions such as pain and genitourinary and neurological scquelae frequently persist.	2.418542867632567
Complicated pelvic injuries, i. e. pelvic injury with concomitant damage to organs and soft tissues in the pelvis and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture (floating hip) are special cases.	2.008527495778002
Haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organic lesions must be the first priorities in the interdisciplinary therapy.	2.8165638853808157
Even when these priorities are correctly observed, the lethality is almost three times as high as in the case of pelvic injuries not involving soft-tissue damage.	2.166864538498394
Acetabular fractures are a particular challenge even compared with other joint fractures.	2.1950593727371133
Operative treatment with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has been shown to have the best results.	2.388502795088762
In addition to the type of fracture and the personal experience of the surgeon concerned, such fracture-specific factors as the presence of further fractures of the posterior wall, comminuted fractures, joint depression fractures and intra-articular fragments increasingly play a part.	2.3234398103091936
The long-term result worsens with increasing number of these additional pathologies.	2.704514293086376
The primary cartilaginous damage caused by the accident seems to have a considerable influence on the long-term result following acetabular fractures.	2.722018477417263
Two-dimensional conventional X-rays and computer tomographic imaging systems contribute to the diagnosis and surgical planning of patients with orofacial malformations.	2.6788258590084455
The ability to reformat CT scans into three-dimensional osseous and soft tissue surface images has a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of orofacial malformations.	2.3237571869498086
Cephalometric evaluation with teleradiography provides precise insight into both the skeletal structures and the soft parts, enabling the radiologist to assess the relationship among the different parts in a given subject, at any given time and in relation to the normal.	2.029500987342764
The purpose of this study was to check the precision of the Dräger vaporizer model 19.3 when filled with three different preparations of isoflurane.	1.9058569625841486
Background: Since there is no epidemiologic assessment of the frequency of pain caused by tumor in Germany, tumor-pain-prevalence is estimated indirectly on the basis of mortality and median survival.	2.606811934171508
Knowing that about 50% of all patients having metastases or incurable locoregional recurrence suffer from pain every day, the product of median survival times mortality was calculated to achieve the number of patients' days with tumor-caused pain per year (82.710.690 days in Germany 1995).	2.0125991364831615
By division with 365 (days), it is calculated that 226.605 patients require tumor pain related treatment at one day in Germany.	2.1130738769266317
Another calculation based on Bonica's publications that 60-90% of patients suffering from advanced cancer are having pain and based on an estimated tumor prevalence 1989/90 revealed a tumor pain prevalence of 221.826.	1.9963811321523168
Laser catheters which run eccentrically on a guide wire were developed for maximization of luminal gain by excimer laser angioplasty (ELCA).	1.8271886428707804
We investigated the safety and efficacy of ELCA with these new catheters plus PTCA in patients with restenoses or occlusions in coronary stents.	2.1656709245887256
The age of standardized instrumented scoliosis correction and stabilization began with Harrington instrumentation (HI).	1.9054562866556772
With HI, satisfactory long-term correction of the frontal plane averaged approximately 50 %, but without notable derotational capabilities.The distraction of the concavity leads to reduction of the sagittal contour of the spine (flat back), which is biomechanically disadvantageous.	2.3594605887660043
The newer multisegmentally attached implant systems avoid this disadvantage.	2.098381719224243
The first prototypes of these systems were Luque- (SSI) and Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation.	1.9399519420101674
However, even with these newer doublerod systems derotation is low, because derotation is, without any doubt, related to anterior release and thus decoupling of the segments by means of disc resection.	1.9943143473704776
Autoaggressive syndromes as causes of diseases underlying chronic blepharitis and keratoconjunctivitis that are refractory to treatment are often difficult to recognize.	1.9961829597191612
The surgical correction of a tandem stenosis of the carotid artery is sometimes difficult, especially if the second stenosis is near or above the skull base.	2.2371926480465283
Angioplasty and Stent implantation may offer an alternative to standard surgical procedures in the treatment of carotid stenoses in the future.	2.6433367065614677
However, the potential advantages of these endovascular techniques warrant continued evaluation.	2.2633611550263097
The application of these techniques in carotid artery tandem stenoses presents specific problems and dangers.	2.0731756665078787
We discuss the case of a 78-year-old man with severe carotid stenoses on both sides and an additional symptomatic tandem stenosis above the skull base on the right side.	2.2946464034904195
After the surgical correction of the left carotid artery using standard endarterectomy, we performed endarterectomy on the right side in combination with an open Stent implantation.	2.70163924746611
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis are also known as Koenen tumors.	2.0878435187516464
Joannes Henricus Maria Koenen was born on March 10, 1893, in Eindhoven and died in Bois-le-Duc May 29, 1956.	1.7004842820767883
From 1910 to 1918 he studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam.	2.251350159095141
Then he worked as a physician at the "Coudewater" asylum in Rosmalen and from 1929 in the "Voorburg" asylum in Vught.	1.7825918741263582
His thesis in 1933 at the University in Leiden was titled "Imbecility in children.	2.097788497781904
Its Importance in pedagogic and social regard, by reason of an investigation in some communities in Noord-Brabant".	1.8791099376963203
Later he was appointed director of a state mental institution.	2.151709489935387
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis were first described by Richad Kothe in Munich in 1903.	1.8732719633160402
Parallel with the increasing number of coronary stent implantation procedures, new or more elaborate coronary stents were introduced into clinical use almost every month in 1996.	2.090039194528528
We have studied the architecture, surface-morphology, and shape-conversion of 16 different coronary stent systems.	1.8741807241142625
The objective of our study was to detect possible specific design and surface features which might influence the healing process, instent restenosis, and stent thrombosis.	2.0450564260062505
Using electron microscopy we found ultrasmooth surfaces on 5 stents.	2.097678660850533
All other coronary stents revealed individually varying and partly sharp-edged surface irregularities.	1.9280238531440237
Video-based morphometry showed covering between 8.3% and 26.4%.	2.0968817365286707
Stent shortening after in-vitro expansion ranged from 0% up to 10.5% of the initial stent length.	2.19520824742657
In some stent systems balloon dilation lead to over-expansion of the stent margaine.	2.046702410362417
This over-expansion mounted up to 20% of the balloon diameter and the stents revealed a rather biconcave than homogenous expansion pattern.	2.0232985720467282
This phenomenon was also found after postmortal stent implantation in 20 autopsied hearts.	2.1949370034611837
Unilateral hearing loss (HL) caused by an acoustic neuroma (AN) is regarded to be neural ("non-cochlear").	2.0773054380981186
By using otoacoustic emissions it is possible to prove concurrent sensory (cochlear) HL.	2.0991513238036847
We prefer distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) because these are more frequency-specific and stable.	1.9421038582845647
From April 1994 to May 1996, we examined preoperatively 24 patients with radiologically proven AN.	2.271167690832688
Pure-tone audiometry, DP-grams, brainstem-evoked response audiometry (BERA) and vestibular studies were performed in all cases, while special auditory tests (Fowler, Carhart) and short increment sensitivity indices were also performed in 12 cases.	1.9200776112724203
BERA was pathological in 23 cases and latencies were borderline in one case.	2.2211632659582285
After comparing audiograms and DP-grams we found 13 patients with sensory HL, 4 patients with combined sensorineural HL and 7 patients with neural HL.	2.0188467363307883
There was a strong correlation between the results of DPOAE and the results of special auditory test (=0.63) whereas there was no correlation between tumor size and cochlear function.	2.501082665146708
The result showed that the typical HL caused by AN was a combined sensorineural loss.	2.205570679548431
DPOAE were not suited for the detection of AN but were able to give exact information about any remaining cochlear function.	2.346714636187317
The monoclonal dominant malignant T cells in mycosis fungoides (MF) carry identical TCR rearrangements.	1.90037437419786
Their detection is a useful diagnostic tool.	2.7074131095960663
Thus, in routine diagnosis we investigated the occurrence of monoclonal T cells in skin biopsy samples of MF-patients by TCR-PCR, followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE).	2.0521381067052578
In 188 out of 208 MF patients, at least one skin sample with sufficient DNA quality for PCR analysis was obtained.	2.049190570856538
Applying a consensus PCR for the TCR genes VI and J 1/2, we detected monoclonal T cells in 122 cases (65%).	1.9667246309249091
In the remaining 66 cases, we performed two multiplex-PCRs, covering rearrangements of the other TCR genes.	2.063387213800291
Here we found in 11 cases (6%) predominant clonal rearrangements of VII-IV and J 1/2 and in 2 (1%) those of VI-IV and J P1/2.	2.1900125727064
In patients with MF, detecting rearrangements of only VI and J 1/2 is sufficient for PCR screening analysis.	1.8690457560625395
In 53 of the patients (28%) the applied methods revealed no monoclonal T cells.	2.593809561922927
This may be due to a low cell number, oligoclonal nature, chromosomal abberations or remaining of TCR in germline configuration.	1.9783510504914634
Despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children, a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification.	1.9699394452248677
The aim of our retrospective cross-sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection.	2.37932087898771
The parents of 70 hearing-impaired children were interviewed.	2.2427887448333146
All children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities.	2.0556381660130163
At an average age of 19.5 months, parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment.	2.187081475957497
On average it then took an additional 7.2 months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation (fitting of hearing aids).	1.881797662904533
Significantly, total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments.	1.8906735991082968
In addition to hearing loss, parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation.	2.1023655769068035
Statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing-impaired close relatives as well as first-born children tended to be diagnosed later.	2.36546558737725
To further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss, the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration.	2.115632875694481
After the incidental puncture of a sidebranch of the thyreocervical trunk during a subclavian vein catheterization, a symptomatic av-fistula developped.	1.8203777796275404
The diagnosis was confirmed by angiography.	2.7114118684572768
Using a microcatheter system the fistula was occluded with microcoils.	2.1544780519514046
This prospective study was designed to compare quality of life, life satisfaction, and subjective ratings of health before and at variable time intervals after heart transplantation (HTx).	2.1254886493891725
175 patients were included between February 1994 and December 1997.	2.575304040942473
Every six months before and 1,5, 3, 6, and 12 months after HTx, they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires: German SF 36, heart failure and specific transplant symptom list, global quality of life assessment, Munich life quality dimension list, expected/experienced life changes after HTx, good command of the German language, and a minimum age of 18 years.	2.214960279503215
During data evaluation, median (Me), mean (M), and standard deviation (SD) were created from individual parameters.	2.3314881941964125
Quality of life was rated as very poor by 84% of patients with congestive heart failure.	2.2390151412445736
Only 6 weeks after HTx, 74% rated their quality of life as significantly better.	2.5149552360752505
Before HTx 80% were very unsatisfied about their health status and 87% about physical performance.	1.9543006240389824
Six weeks after HTx, this parameter improved significantly and 76% were very satisfied about their health status and 50% about physical performance.	1.9240437222494045
While somatic changes expected before HTx corresponded well with experienced ones, psychological improvements were smaller than expected, but one year after HTx they were significant (before: M=3.66; SD=0.9; Range (R)=3.78 vs 12 months postop: M=4.61; SD=0.6; R=2.67; p<0.05).	1.6390164410555663
Quality of life correlated before HTx best with subjectively rated health (r=0.61, p<0.01) and 6 months after with satisfaction about health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).	1.9384029285479536
Only in 25% were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity/satisfaction, professional situation, and recreational activities.	1.871701304259213
90% of posttransplant patients reported physical compaints, most by effects of immunsuppression, but were coping well.	1.948737898357339
The study shows that already 6 weeks after successful HTx all quality of life parameters improved significantly.	2.449826981398346
Despite some unfulfilled expectations and complaints, the postoperative life situation of HTx patients appeared significantly improved.	1.9887233590670141
Sevoflurane is a "new" volatile inhaled anaesthetic.	2.7315880731928073
Owing to its lower blood-gas solubility coefficient, emergence from anaesthesia is faster with sevoflurane than with isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane.	1.8727369245668932
In this study, we compared serum inorganic fluoride concentrations (IFCs) in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane.	2.033591039407454
Furthermore, indices of renal function were evaluated until the 3rd postoperative day.	2.1593959494186565
Background: Rarely, an additional Brown's syndrome develops spontaneously in cases of posttraumatic bilateral superior oblique palsy.	2.2016584893148425
Surgical measures are controversial and problematic.	2.4590699009402863
Metastasis formation is a multistep process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages.	2.0907723599694097
One of the first steps is a disturbance of the epithelial integrity through a decrease in intercellular homotypic adhesion.	2.4257944626473407
Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, as well as increased locomotion, leads to intravasation and dissemination of the tumor cells.	2.7488623559897425
Finally, neoangiogenesis is required for the initiation as well as the growth of the metastases, providing the tumor cells with both nutritive agents and growth factors.	2.4361024014032036
This leads to the conclusion that anti-proteolytic and anti-angiogenic substances could provide effective therapeutic approaches for the control of metastatic growth.	2.0776820408063337
Whether or not this goal can be accomplished by synthetic or endogenous drugs must still be demonstrated by basic and definitive clinical research.	1.9768532304177289
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint.	2.458160836315264
Urodynamic examinations were performed in 82 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before and after radical prostatectomy.	2.598850072164506
A significant decrease in bladder capacity (396 ml to 331.9 ml), urethral closure pressure (89.6 cm H2O to 65.,2 cm H2O) and functional profile length (61 mm to 25.9 mm) was noted.	1.8513530071441806
The continence rate after radical prostatectomy was 33.4 % after 1 month, 69.4 % after 3 months, 84.7 % after 6 months, and 90.9 % after 12 months, respectively.	2.1861508341559226
A correlation was found between urethral closure pressure and functional profile length and continence.	2.2140922795177387
A second urodynamic examination was performed 6 months after radical prostatectomy.	2.4273190325128904
Functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased.	2.42413705094434
These data suggest that restoration of continence is based on sphincteric parameters.	2.3797202260261368
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound with biological tissue with regard to cancer therapy.	2.460741494882623
The physical and biological aspects of this are reviewed and summarized in this paper.	2.3921094415249704
The preliminary results give reason to hope, as ultrasound is easy to focuse and might be applicable as a supplementary therapeutic technique in ultrasound-accessible tumors.	1.8975500225013888
The changes observed in biological studies are clearly a function of the pyhsical parameters.	2.2126319327854724
Therefore, it is possible to calculate and predict the biological effects.	2.4900078079600383
Recent results have shown the potential of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring ultrasound therapy online.	2.559888886107763
The capability of MRI to measure temperature will be an important tool for the safe and reliable application of this new therapeutic approach.	2.3916048019018503
The role of ultrasound therapy in the management of human tumors must be clarified in carefully conducted clinical trials.	2.1705710771045257
Posttraumatic deformities after pediatric fractures are either the result of incomplete or failed remodeling, complete or partial stimulation of the growth plates, or complete or partial closure of a growth plate.	2.0820979898850114
In contrast to fractures of the upper extremities, spontaneous remodeling should not be intentionally integrated in the treatment algorithm.	2.8052855255295617
In the context of the quality assurance program of the German pension insurance institutions, instruments and procedures have been developed in the past few years in order to assess the quality of structure, process, and results of inpatient rehabilitation, as well as patient satisfaction.	2.788939829730689
The routine implementation of these procedures aims at providing rehabilitation hospitals with fast information on shortcomings in their current practice, so that concepts of treatment and - in the long run - effects of rehabilitation can be systematically improved.	2.0908727638867686
When the "quality profiles" of rehabilitation hospitals are compared ("benchmarking"), paying institutions of rehabilitation could gain information on the cost-quality-ratio of particular hospitals as well as important leads for improving the steering processes of patients and hospitals.	2.0900496377019855
In the present article, results of a first "field-run" of the procedures for measuring patient satisfaction and quality of rehabilitation processes are reported.	2.2791822925583136
A comparative analysis of patient satisfaction in four orthopaedic/rheumatologic rehabilitation hospitals showed high degrees of overall satisfaction in all hospitals.	1.9325982858601718
In several subdimensions of patient satisfaction, however, significant differences between hospitals were found.	2.75756600667109
Quality of rehabilitation processes - as assessed by a standardized peer-review - varied substantially between 36 hospitals.	2.00832783373657
Problems of quality were found especially in some dimensions that must be considered as crucial for rehabilitation, e.g., in the history and diagnosis of disabilities, in the consideration of psycho-social problems, or in the assessment of occupational capacities.	2.475958738827244
The analysis of THR-failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement.	2.4122100180167116
The acetabular cup fails more often than the stem.	2.3362891895230833
In the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups.	2.00096148241565
The known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases exponentially 8 to 10 years after implantation, could of course not be seen in this study.	2.1170944239989526
The success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, age over 70 and the fixation manner: the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of pressfit cups although the Zweymüller-cup as well as the Link type V-cup showed good results.	2.0841170186266496
The midterm results of the stem were very good for the cementless as for the cemented technique.	2.395989760030335
Some implants showed compared to others significantly worse results.	2.275505753640432
The further implantation should be thought of, what partially has already happened.	2.031881352071754
Type I and type II diabetes are the most common types of diabetes.	2.712121435446573
The ratio of type I to type II diabetes is about 1:9.	2.4150564179554252
Type I diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes.The disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence ("juvenile diabetes"), although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed.	2.0013395570701533
Morphologically, a subtotal ( > 80 %) to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic islets occurs.	2.1582567943692132
Lymphocytic insulitis, which disappears after the beta cells have been totally destroyed, is pathognomonic of type I diabetes.	2.028179259936429
This insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors.	2.241901561351842
An important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition (HLA DR3/DR4/DQ8) in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors (e. g., viruses).	2.127574313121362
Autoantibodies, such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and/or autoantibodies to the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid carboxylase (GAD), are already detectable in a prediabetic phase, although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestion.	2.2976087073220244
The course of the disease is dependent on age.	2.9989708917892717
Young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults.	2.0620389217838193
This article summarizes data from recent studies on the prevalence, diagnosis and therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.	2.39774367737782
The prevalence of this disorder in 4-6 year old children is 0.7%.	2.5022781613990417
Leading clinical sign in 90% of patients is habitual snoring, but this is rather nonspecific, as 60% of patients investigated for habitual snoring do not have OSAS.	2.1622213874281497
Other signs such as daytime sleepiness, failure to thrive, profuse nocturnal sweating or mouth breathing are equally nonspecific.	1.8614093365288868
The diagnosis, therefore, has to be confirmed by polysomnography, where OSAS is suggested by the occurrence of >5 obstructive apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep in conjunction with a CO2 of >50 mmHg for >8% of sleep time and/or >1 desaturation to <=90%/h.	2.239338549349621
Patients with progressive cancer and their families face a series of existential crises with each stage of disease up to terminal stages in which palliative treatment is begun, and patients come to accept the inevitability of death.	1.8538909694832302
This can lead to a unique, highly emotional situation with direct or indirect, open or hidden, varied and very personal manifestations.	1.94539372774186
The dermatological clinic in Homburg was founded in 1945.	2.158924216105667
A review of the history of the clinic documents advances and challenges in clinical dermatology, as well as new developments in related basic research during the last 50 years.	2.388396772462459
The coexistence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease occurs in a small percentage of patients requiring open heart surgical procedures.	2.4904774222285564
Whether the combined surgical approach favorably influences the outcome of patients requiring major cardiac operations remains controversial.	2.213519212471474
We report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery.	2.1780291964435254
A 33-year-old woman suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after treatment with FSH/HCG for in-vitro fertilization.	2.254323449433758
She developed a transient left hemiparesis.	2.4423249339237123
This was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery.	2.739733847190982
Open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms.	2.404960918158119
The development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in housewives.	2.0630371564739223
In 1986 we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife.	2.037502791366747
Now, we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the household and grade them in comparison to the data of 1986.	2.18525402745766
The results are based on the analysis of a large population of 2633 patients with the occupation "housewife" and the diagnosis "eczema" who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK).	2.1351369075818303
Data for HIV infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality.	1.9792976486749712
Estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic, even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk.	2.454091132863132
Extrapolations of data from discordant couple cohort studies and from US seroincidence studies may be seriously biased.	1.9169611061579332
Infectivity of and susceptibility to HIV may be influenced by concomitant STDs, antiretroviral therapy, alloimmunization and/or subinfectious virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter- and intraindividual variability.	2.033691354906418
Differences in factors influencing transmission probability of HIV most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of HIV.	1.8944457047233727
Between January 1989 and March 1997, 175 patients with traumatic shoulder dislocations were treated by conservative means (median age 41 years, 39 F, 136 M).	2.018496909867404
In 78 patients (17 F, 61 M) a clinical and radiological follow up (median 50 months, range 6-106) could be obtained.	2.2674394087196
Additionally, a diagnostic ultrasound was carried out in all patients.	2.519629756750291
The recurrence rate in the group younger than 30 years (G < 30; n = 35) was 86 %; in the group older than 30 years (G > 30; n = 43) it was 21 % (P < 0.05).	2.098876190997049
Persisting neurological deficits were found in 6 patients (8 %).	2.8662359041397494
According to the Rowe score, 16 patients (46 %) of the G < 30 achieved excellent or good results, in the G > 30, 29 patients (67 %).	2.560708327969761
18 % had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity.	2.660599183914361
Hill-Sachs lesions were identified in 19 % of cases.	2.532620424586752
Rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in 9 % by ultrasound.	2.425157281531584
No relationship between the duration of immobilization and the recurrence rate was found (P = 0.95).	2.5133862912557308
The recurrence rate following primary shoulder dislocation depends primarily on the patients' age.	2.277046577949229
We analyzed quality assurance protocol records of 532 geriatric hospital patients in comparison to an administration database concerning data on "length of stay" information (LOS).	2.0360566713110355
Doctors handwritten quality assurance protocol records corresponded in 74.25% of cases to administration data.	2.0045719738251613
14.47% of cases were registered with different LOS; 11.28% of LOS information was missing.	2.1649060753507565
The increasing amount of documentation tasks in German geriatric hospitals is discussed.	2.090363685908571
Conclusion: We assume that not only discrete well known information (admission and discharge dates, LOS) are contaminated by documentation failure but also data on functional status of geriatric patients which may have important influence on external data processing.	1.8262264096253722
The majority of patients with symptomatic spondylolysis can be treated conservatively.	2.888752961664783
Only when symptoms persist in spite of conservative treatment surgery may be indicated.	2.460780928245523
In young patients, however, fusion of a mobile segment should be avoided, but a direct repair of the pars defect can be attempted.	2.6144290193428152
This procedure allows complete healing and possibly avoids degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	2.100993334153074
For this purpose Morscher developed the hook screw, which connects the arch with the anterior articular process.	1.8415622246128363
It allows compression of the defect without crossing the defect with the screw.	2.3780191767788033
A follow-up study of the first 33 patients with a follow-up time of 3.5 years on average showed a good subjective result in 79 % of the patients.	2.8949164012126296
The reason for the better results in young patients is that in older patients the origin of the pain is often not the pars defect, but the degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	2.5339126989783876
Direct repair of spondylolysis is therefore indicated when pain persists after 6 months of conservative treatment or there is a progressive olisthesis of not more than 10 mm.	2.24309102692173
After the end of growth an MRI study of the intervertebral discs should show whether there is degeneration or not.	2.3277974469896296
Direct repair is indicated only in the absence of disc degeneration.	2.817114055618436
After the age of 25 years this procedure should not be carried out.	2.8513716594466816
We are presenting a 47-year-old woman who was stung by jellyfish while bathing in the sea of Thailand.	1.942894750788713
Immediately after the injury she developed sharp pain and urticarial erythema of the skin of the knees accompanied by muscle cramps of the entire body.	2.210267299847481
After a few days a toxic contact dermatitis with edematous swelling and ulcerations developed, which did not respond to topical antibiotics or corticosteroids.	2.0949818977129437
Three weeks later the patient presented with a disseminated urticarial eruption, which at first responded well to topical treatment and systemic corticosteroids.	2.172657325710546
Over the next few weeks, however, a relapse of the eruption and the ulcerations occurred.	2.442990391305518
Raised titres of IgG and IgM antibodies against different jellyfish from the Indian and Pacific Ocean were detected in the patient's serum by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.	1.8782614518326957
Antibodies against bees (class 1) and wasps (class 4) were found by the radioallergosorbent test.	2.2060901319320183
First aid and secondary treatment of jellyfish injuries are suggested.	2.2206814747385977
The design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task.	2.3153962766312666
In particular in ICD trials, false estimations and omissions have occured that can compromise the interpretation of a trial.	1.979139689556542
Identification of crucial issues that should be regulated in a study protocol in order to minimize the risk of failure.	2.6373110873170607
Evaluation of the weaknesses of completed antiarrhythmic trials.	2.1586218054684467
Problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs.	2.1686879091074505
Further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared.	2.108756932422389
Technical mistakes as imprecise definitions, arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial, unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol.	1.9413716380370851
A prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is drafted is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial.	2.2773617232182835
Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation.	2.43785950461962
Its general availability and the absence of radiation exposure and discomfort for the patient also make it a suitable procedure for follow-up.	2.4209708476448615
Simple B-mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures, while color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion.	2.0847944217462215
More recent technical advances such as power Doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation.	2.098821478950632
The possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts.	2.613127498574973
Purpose: The first morphological changes in eyes with HIV infection are microvascular disease of the retina with cotton-wool spots and microaneurysms.	1.9919542574670606
The study was performed to find out if evidence of disturbances of ocular microcirculation can be established by non-invasive methods.	2.6968606271884634
The operative realignment of mechanical axis deviations (MAD) is necessary to prevent early joint degeneration and to reach normal load-bearing.	2.0922143273165004
Modern types of external fixation systems allow an alignment of the mechanical axis to exact degrees.	2.1506298177210224
Predominantly this are corrections of angular deformities.	2.3460986131540817
In some cases the analysis of the MAD does not show any angular deformity, but a parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines of a bone.	2.2671053612579555
Such parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines is defined as a translation deformity of the bone.	2.2908581102078975
In combined deformities with angulation and translation the centre of deformity can be established proximal or distal out of the limit of the bone.	2.2166134484970934
In translation deformities the realignment of the mechanical axis requires a parallel re-staggering made by a translation-osteotomy or by a counterangulated double osteotomy.	1.8808421238214557
In complex deformities with angulation and translation, the translation requires a separate corrective planning.	1.9504431786898797
By using external fixator systems to perform acute or progressive corrective osteotomies the position of the Axis of Correction of Angulation (ACA) in relation to the n-CORA of the deformity has to be considered.	1.980298468521073
These geometric effects to corrective osteotomies can be calculated by using simple trigonometric formulas or graphical methods.	1.9126683395599353
Possibilities to compensate translation and length effects are shown by using unilateral external fixator systems.	2.1035729610195926
The employers' liability insurance association for victuallers and licensed victuallers has been controlling healing procedures with the aid of a computer program for several years.	1.8055661544222377
The personal data of the injured patient and the precise diagnosis of the injury are used to prepare a forecast of the duration of the treatment and of the patient's inability to work.	3.02046440713618
The basis of this forecast is provided by tables integrated in the program, which have been elaborated by experts on trauma medicine and also constantly refined by them.	2.005962955212477
Meanwhile numerous insurance companies concerned with accidents and trauma have acquired the program and are intending to use it.	1.9320024350000586
The objective is a national database on trauma medicine covering the whole of Germany.	2.0232304936396557
It is intended that its evaluation will help to guarantee the quality of concomitant treatment of trauma victims and also yield some indications on how best to realize the networking of institutions concerned with acute treatment and rehabilitation.	1.9085825864784534
Stroke and its consequences are under medical, sociologic and socioeconomic aspects one of the biggest contemporary challenges.	2.2223219785256356
Due to the demographic development the importance of this disease will further increase.	2.5894433607342466
Nonetheless acute therapy of ischemic stroke up to now was marked by therapeutic nihilism and adherence to empiric therapeutic procedures.	2.0940348558017403
Only the admission of rt-Pa in the USA in 1996 for the systemic thrombolysis in ischemic insults less then 3 hours old led to a change in therapeutic strategies.	2.0354028685013534
The good profit-risk-ratio of early thrombolysis with rt-Pa could be confirmed by further studies lately.	2.1917661008490072
In the meantime this therapy was officially recommended by the AHA in the importance of grade A recommendation.	2.1866555803862284
In Europe thrombolysis is equally promoted as the procedure of choice.	2.213619028190573
A thrombolytic therapy can only be provided by a minority of centers due to high requirement in infra-structure.	2.186636430810068
Furthermore clinic admission often appears with immense loss of time.	2.118583221743406
Unfortunately also within the clinics there are relevant latencies until therapeutic intervention.	2.129940514013281
Therefore fundamental requirements for thrombolytic therapy are the indentification of potentially suitable patients and the rapid transfer to an appropriate clinic.	2.1273791107294286
A 69-year-old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non-small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus, pulmonary artery and left atrium.	2.3944112289425856
Using cardiopulmonary bypass, an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed.	2.649803795871927
The cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch.	2.283138435890396
The lower lobe was divided ex situ from the upper lobe and reimplanted with anastomosis of the lower pulmonary vein to the left auricle.	2.109117553034147
After a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence 2.5 years postoperatively.	2.2318282656097588
In this retrospective study we report the indications, complications and functional and cosmetic results after dermofat grafting into anophthalmic orbits.	2.1388395870066446
The method consists of implantation of autogenous dermis with attached subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region into the orbit.	1.9137852656885304
Twenty-four primary and 4 secondary grafts were implanted in 28 patients aged 12 to 49 years.	2.0434200958687203
In the explantation site one patient showed delayed healing.	2.1553096267718717
All implants became integrated, none were lost because of infection or extrusion.	2.162487959544761
Eleven patients developed minor complications like central ulceration in the dermis, hair growth on the dermis or suture granuloma.	1.9118344558939444
In the primary implant group the functional and cosmetic outcome was evaluated by measurements of the lid structures, exophthalmometry (Hertel) and measuring the prosthesis motility (Kestenbaum).	1.988902246263268
Three patients showed fair results; all the others had good or very good results.	2.2648023638480144
In one case of a secondary implant marked graft atrophy was observed.	2.5277650713645796
Despite the more extensive surgery and some minor complications the safety of this method with good functional and cosmetic results makes dermofat grafting an excellent alternative to heterogenous orbital implants.	2.015678620980743
Liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; stages I-IV) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen-presenting cells.	1.9910251321944452
Dendritic cells (DCs) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti-S 100 protein and KiMlp antibodies.	2.1543044914497336
We confirm previous findings that, in early PBC, S 100 protein-positive DCs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia.	2.090151049925388
However, the present study disclosed that S 100 protein- and KiMlp-positive DCs regularly occur in piecemeal necroses (PMNs) developing in PBC-associated chronic hepatitis.	1.8911476813767174
These findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in PBC may not be limited to bile ducts, but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma, producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity.	1.9415190029708642
Health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a humane society, the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies.	2.001826676720629
The ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics.	2.2838645373275717
Their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to dilemmas characteristic of emergency care.	2.2322481072836555
Due to dwindling resources, the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized.	2.302861372275234
Possibilities of rationalizing care without compromising its quality are being discussed, such as renouncing futile therapy and implementing measures of prevention.	2.0329860019484944
If emergency medical services are to accomplish their mission, however, observing standards of medical practice, legal provisions, and the given framework of society, they must not surrender to pure cost containment.	2.1408199597564868
We performed a phase II trial with second-line chemotherapy in patients with refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder.	2.394082199489396
Second-line therapy consists of 2.6 cycles of mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid.	2.066257663423981
Two patients suffered from WHO grade III side effects (nephrotoxicity, leukocytopenia).	2.2449058029787947
We did not find any complete or partial remission.	2.409571697240285
Four patients had a stable disease; 3.3 months after therapy, patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of 9 months.	2.3342875111882857
Four patients reported an improvement in quality of life.	2.5796577719750875
Since all patients received supportive care, improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone.	2.3497707734518576
In conclusion, second-line chemotherapy with mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid has no effect on refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder and is no alternative for cisplatin and methotrexate-based chemotherapy.	1.795619941840054
Every form of active euthanasia is a punishable offence under § 216 of the Penal Code; nor is there any ethical justification for it from a medical point of view.	1.7697768835925298
The many strands of the movement in favour of making "death on demand" exempt from punishment in Germany as it is in The Netherlands cannot change this.	1.932414647759655
The oral retinoid etretinate (Tigason) has recently been replaced by trans-acitretin (Neotigason) in the treatment of severe psoriasis, primarily because of its short half-life and the assumption that a shorter period of subsequent contraception would be required.	2.267664952436966
After introduction of the new drug, however, circulating quantities of etretinate were detected in patients treated with trans-acitretin.	2.635852940265247
Thus far, re-esterification has been detected in at least 83 cases.	2.360025197505326
The 2-month period of strict contraception initially recommended after oral intake of trans-acitretin has been extended to 2 years, as with etretinate.	2.070784151565444
We review some aspects of trans-acitretin metabolism, with special emphasis on etretinate formation.	2.251013758886562
Re-esterification of trans-acitretin into etretinate takes place under varying conditions in volunteers and patients, as well as in animal models.	2.2677609070118145
Ethanol is a co-factor for the enzymatic re-esterification of trans-acitretin.	2.1409763524696444
The purpose of this study was to compare the midterm results of the conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures in athletes.	2.2236809366217227
During 1989 and 1990, 279 athletes with ACL ruptures were treated in our Sports Surgery Department, and 221 of them were suitable for inclusion in the study.	1.976228868111355
The patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of ACL rupture had been  made.	2.2608726217836996
Group I (n = 129) underwent ACL reconstruction using free bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, while group II (n = 92) received conservative treatment.	1.9963979644940328
We were able to evaluate 92 patients during follow-up (42 from group I and 50 from group II).	2.367164573706318
Follow-up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients.	2.53508559982236
During follow-up, we used IKDC and OAK scores to evaluate the results.	2.682391673525376
Background: By depletion of stratospheric ozone, enhanced levels of UV radiation reach the surface of the earth.	2.0171901652414985
Exposure of the anterior parts of the eye to UV radiation leads to irritation of the conjunctival and corneal cells.	2.385142414320478
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a low field strength MRI unit (0.2 T; Esaote, Biomedica) and a high field strength MRI unit (1.5 T; Siemens) in detecting meniscal lesions.	1.8732552338383204
Twenty patients were investigated on a 0.2-T low-field MRI unit and a 1.5-T high-field MRI unit for meniscal lesions.	2.17177662275977
Evaluation was performed of four meniscal compartments (anterior and posterior medial and lateral meniscus), for a total of 80 observations.	2.3437940323061444
The reliability of diagnosis was ranked qualitatively on a three-point scale.	2.254770950178867
Investigations of the high-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 6 patients and ruled out a tear in 14 patients.	2.209535221709373
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 58 observations and with moderate confidence in 22 observations.	1.8161658465966373
Investigations of the low-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 5 patients and ruled out tears in 15 patients.	2.135867506744197
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 39 observations, with moderate confidence in 38 observations, and with low confidence in 3 observations.	1.8172024814379133
The diagnosis in high- and low-field images was identical in 98.7 % of cases; in one patient observations from the high-field unit changed the therapeutic management.	2.375648047366336
Diagnostic reliability was significantly higher with highfield strength MR imaging.	2.38477722288534
The past decade has seen the successful application of genetic techniques in the dissection of the most important phenotypes of cancer cells.	2.4502582653300364
In the case of drug resistance mechanisms, the elucidation of the genes involved in resistance to anticancer agents has led to new and unexpected information about tumor physiology and may well open therapeutic options by virtue of reversing clinical chemoresistance.	1.8205800330039386
The experimental characterization of defined multidrug resistance factors, such as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance associated protein, topoisomerase, or glutathione-S-transferase in urologic malignancies, is now relatively comprehensive, allowing for an initial analysis.	1.8144246954466656
Clinical studies on some of these concepts have been started and will be the subject of careful scrutinity.	2.207381703014984
We expect that they will have a considerable impact on the way certain urologic anticancer strategies will be pursued in the future.	2.0815342854990257
A study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery.	2.8370565370045004
A total of 1103 impacted lower wisdom teeth and 3 impacted lower second molars were removed in 687 patients, all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively.	1.744434428379422
Postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination.	2.2238984201453973
Follow-up was carried out for a maximum of 35 weeks.	2.7797354966144825
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve occurred with an incidence of 3.57%.	2.2495490397273272
The lingual nerve was injured in 2.1% of patients.	2.210017910613276
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0.91%, and of the lingual nerve in 0.37%.	2.115450866252998
However, the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general.	2.316679249158849
The effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed.	2.7203405116212416
For the inferior alveolar nerve, analysis revealed significant effects in older patients, for completely developed roots, for deeply impacted teeth, in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal, for difficult surgery, and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve.	2.1501401733943357
The surgeon and the anesthesia had a significant influence on lingual dysesthesia.	2.260297779377487
Background: This review of radiological and other procedures used in the diagnosis of (chronic) low-back pain is not intended to provide a complete evaluation of the methods employed, because the validity, specificity and sensitivity of the various diagnostic measures are the subject of so much controversy that a comprehensive discussion would be beyond the scope of the present overview.	2.4133286477715052
The choice of method depends not only on the clinical symptoms but also on the localisation of the pain, the aetiology of which may also be related to the age of the patient.	2.641864335112802
Enteritis and pseudoappendicitis are typical manifestations of Yersinia infections in children.	2.157646079534299
This is a report on a child with localised tumourous mesenteric lymphadenitis due to Yersinia enterocolitica persistent for a long time.	2.036656028702561
We found specific antibodies against Yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat-edly in the patients' serum.	2.215555710950191
Only after a ciprofloxacin therapy for 16 weeks we observed a recovery of our patient.	2.1533156898220134
The present study investigates patients' expectations toward radiotherapy and their associations to quality of life and physician judgements.	2.1153707387825276
Fifty-five patients with tumors of different sites (30 with previous tumor-related surgery, 25 without surgery) admitted to the department of radiotherapy filled out a standardized questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, PLC by Siegrist et al., therapy-related expectations and success) before and after inpatient radiotherapy.	1.929383968774336
Fifty-eight percent of the patients expected the therapeutic goal "healing", whereas from the physician's standpoint this was realistic in only 7 % of cases.	2.164699969216887
The specific radiotherapy-related expectations "tumor control" and "pain relief" reached almost the same levels in patients and physician (71 % vs 71 % and 40 % vs 44 %).	1.9948352970603715
Patients with healing expectancy reported higher quality of life at the beginning of the therapy (53.4 % vs 39.9 %); patients expecting pain relief reported lower quality of life (37.1 % vs 54.5 %).	2.117158467482576
Surgical patients who had been operated on within the past year (n = 18) showed a particularly high healing expectancy (83 %), whereas patients whose operation dated back more than 1 year focused on pain relief as therapeutic goal (83 %).	2.151402962789303
The surgeon, as the primary contact person for patients, can influence patients' therapy-related expectations.	2.3044132361117735
In explaining the overall therapeutic strategy, surgeons should also mention the scope and limits of adjuvant therapies.	1.9590803792305755
The meanings of the terms "quality", "quality of care", and "quality management" were clarified with common international definitions.	2.19653847370683
Based on that, the basic ideas, concepts, and objectives of quality management in medicine were explained.	2.127060957802037
Finally some future trends related to quality were viewed, which represent challenges for the medical profession and entire medicine.	1.9552764571126255
The papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS) was first described in 1990 by Harms et al.	1.8306487013589232
The syndrome is characterised by fever, an itchy erythema with edema, confluent papules and purpura of the hands and feet in a "gloves and socks" distribution.	1.9706028821135961
The skin lesions may be associated with purpura and superficial erosions of the oral mucosa.	2.4879243153561186
Viral infections, in particular parvovirus B19, are the most likely trigger.	2.867409075417361
In the present case PPGSS developed after taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.	1.9660360388685916
Since the patient developed identical symptoms after accidental re-challenge with the same drug, this case strongly suggests medications as another factor in the pathogenesis of PPGSS.	2.1730668077034387
Most fractures of the clavicle heal well with nonoperative treatment.	2.7923660514821504
On rare occasions, malunited clavicular fractures are associated with a pattern of disability that includes not only pain but also functional or neurovascular impairment.	2.023152166093126
In these cases, clavicular osteotomy and correction of the deformity should be considered.	2.293697665062689
In four patients with a malunited fracture of the clavicle following nonoperative treatment, we performed a clavicular osteotomy for deformity.	2.591348648891431
In all four patients the clavicular fracture healed with shortening associated with pain and ipsilateral glenohumeral dysfunction.	1.961395463926911
The deformity was not associated with neurovascular dysfunction.	2.364260443564141
In preoperative X-ray studies, the shortening of the malunited clavicle was between 0.9 and 2.2 cm in comparison to the contralateral clavicle.	2.3773879574016257
All patients underwent an extension osteotomy of the clavicle with interposition of an autogenous iliac crest bone graft.	2.160524812631013
The follow-up was 1 - 4 years postoperatively.	2.7745293000551046
The functional outcome was evaluated using the Constant-Murley and the UCLA score.	2.1664097582900252
All patients had immediate pain relief following osteotomy and correction of the deformity.	2.230594789661397
If there is associated functional impairment in malunited clavicular fractures, extension osteotomy combined with autogenous bone grafting may produce predictably good results.	1.8339028264801764
As the importance of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract continues to grow, the application of this approach in cases of malignancy remains controversial.	2.6769654691454554
Although the concept of cancer recurrence in the area of surgical wounds is not new, the incidence of port site recurrence is the most obvious concern.	2.7164003482388535
Indications and contraindications for surgery as well as a standardized nomenclature describing the type of laparoscopic procedures being performed are some other issues that need to be clarified.	2.2965675149618745
Complete laparoscopic procedures or the combination of laparoscopy with open techniques can offer advantages and disadvantages that surgeons will have to take into consideration when making decisions.	2.08906753492969
The skill of the operating team and the extent of disease define the boundaries of laparoscopic surgery possible.	2.3807174304249905
The continued research as well as development of intelligent instruments and standardized techniques might give laparoscopy a clear role in the treatment of abdominal malignancies.	2.5890578512014035
Background: The mechanical stabilization of the cornea in keratoconus may delay progression of this disease.	2.232879750079339
The cross-linking techniques optimized in corneas of enucleated porcine eyes were investigated under in vivo conditions in rabbits to estimate the biocompatibility and duration of the stiffening effect.	2.0212414388603874
In the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54-year-old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor, spindle-cell neoplasia was seen.	1.9707079266515903
No clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible.	2.3040006966631625
After resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses, the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma.	2.798261308190363
This was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane antigene (EMA) and of vimentin.	2.203762957667324
Extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with extrapulmonary localization.	2.442927283935979
This case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma.	1.9680743365983093
Especially in small biopsy samples showing a submucous spindle-cell tumor of the lung, apart from frequent sarcoma metastases, the presence of primary synovial sarcoma of the lung has to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	2.4275763956359127
Necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.	2.3798893806380046
Formerly, surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard.	2.5584599014987255
Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis.	2.9537875527278663
A considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation.	2.787774622062828
Nevertheless, surgical treatment is indicated in patients with infected necrosis and in sterile necrosis if multiorgan failure persists over a limited period of time despite maximum intensive care therapy.	2.361462659977683
Pancreatic resection should be abandoned for surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis, as results with regard to morbidity, mortality and long-term outcome are unsatisfactory.	2.634154022126174
Today the surgical standard is careful digital necrosectomy, which must be followed by either postoperatve drainage, repeated open lavage or continuous closed lavage.	1.8646752274213432
In experienced hands, all three procedures provide similar results with regard to morbidity and mortality.	2.3638936964460044
The aim of quality management in rheumatology is to improve care and outcome in patients with rheumatic diseases.	2.620242503987613
This can be achieved by means of prospective long-term observation of the patient with regular documentation of clinical, radiological, biochemical and functional data using certain validated scoring methods (DAS, radiological score, ADL score Hanover or Health assessment questionnaire, SF36, etc.).	2.151203399368593
Long-term observation and documentation including radiographs have been performed in the rheumatology hospital in Ratingen for 20 years without even knowing the term quality management.	1.9496329254970297
Quality management in a hospital for rheumatic diseases begins with certain structural prerequisites: possibility of direct admission of a patient to the hospital by the family physician, outpatient clinic to investigate and to follow patients over a long period of time, multidisciplinary team with specialists in rheumatology, orthopedic surgery, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, special care, psychological, and social services, close cooperation with specialists in neurology, dermatology, ophthalmology, etc., department of radiology, special laboratory, facilities for internal diagnostics and treatment.	1.8846533337274116
The hospital needs a training program for the qualification of rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons.	1.9864231517132145
The hospital staff should closely cooperate with the doctors in private practice who admit patients and should continously support patient organizations.	1.9187268754471944
The quality of outcome is influenced by the process quality which depends on the following factors: selection, training and motivation of the hospital staff; supervision of clinical assessment and documentation by senior physicians, daily x-ray demonstrations and case reports, interdisciplinary case demonstrations at least every week in addition to daily consultation, team reports, regular education including review of actual literature for physicians, education programs exchanging knowledge with physiotherapists and nurses, and regular education programs for patients.	1.8733481831488035
Process quality can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary approach and regular communication between all participants including the patient, whose opinion must be noted and regarded.	2.266727966544666
As far as possible, the same doctor who treats the patient in the hospital should follow her/him in the outpatient clinic.	2.2058612625895173
The quality of outcome can be improved by regular reinvestigation of the patient with control of medication, side effects, efficacy, documentation of clinical, biochemical, radiological, and functional data.	2.2900453370847096
Decisions for further treatment have to be based on these follow-up data.	3.3494659653550802
A standardized follow up and documentation system for all rheumatology units with prompt feedback could definitely improve the quality of rheumatologic care in Germany.	2.0471716745865125
Two children on chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had initially focal, then generalized seizures of short duration.	1.7543179534976268
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed in one case minor parietal, cortical and subcortical increased signal on T2-weighted images.	1.993260552137224
In a second case extended supratentorial lesions and additional signal changes in the cerebellum were found.	2.1983075079096284
Although chemotherapy was continued, a few days later signal changes were considerably reduced or had disappeared.	2.140967224295058
We consider these lesions to be seizure induced in a brain previously sensitized by chemotherapy.	2.0060728152923444
Hydatid disease is caused by the parasitic tapeworm Echinococcus.	2.713089146913442
The larval stage of this parasite can thrive in many parts of the body, most frequently in the liver.	2.2516416598392355
Primary bone location is very rare, accounting for less than 2 % of all hydatid lesions.	2.3712956805681893
We report on a case of left-sided extended pelvic infestation.	2.405937020235724
The destruction of the hip joint, os pubis, large parts of the ileum and the femoral head made pelvic resection and prosthetic replacement necessary.	2.380294355899621
Recurrence of a hydatid cyst 5 years later in the left groin originating from the proximal femur was treated with second femoral resection and new total hip replacement.	2.21039675357694
Because of instability, the primarily inserted polyacetal pelvic replacement had to be exchanged for a custom-made device fabricated with the aid of computer-aided design (CAD) techniques.	1.9546757128593264
This surgical procedure was combined with chemotherapy (mebendazole).	2.454604938210714
The necessity of radical resection in osseus hydatid disease is discussed.	2.101588013300187
At present, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of low cardiac output states.	2.5980981621557913
Despite their positive inotropic and lusitropic effects, these drugs are still under discussion because of certain adverse effects like thrombopaenia, elevation of transaminases, abdominal disregulation, and excessive periphereal vasodilatation.	1.79889117847729
As a consequence, more cardioselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors were developed with the aim of reducing these adverse effects.	2.00426013718311
One of them, enoximone (Marion Merrell Dow, Fig.	1.9260216891844006
1), an imidazole derivative, has nearly no influence on platelets and abdominal organ function.	2.2023713200313444
In addition, in many studies vasodilatation was found to be absent.	2.4184294253228766
1), was developed.	3.160683499167652
First experimental studies showed high cardioselectivity of this substance.	2.270377895014417
The aim of this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of enoximone and R80122 in patients with ischaemic heart disease.	2.111192194255655
The extremely rare finding of a proximal radio-ulnar synostosis in a 5 years-old girl with a fetal alcohol syndrome is presented.	2.0946326160637394
Despite the elbow's being fixed at 30  ° pronation, the patient exhibits good ipsilateral arm function.	2.099572578362208
The difficulties in differential diagnosis and treatment modalities are discussed.	2.6836843950918663
Ischemic preconditioning (IP), using one or more brief periods of ischemia before a sustained ische- mia, represents a new approach in reducing ischemia-induced skeletal muscle damage.	1.9297869302291548
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IP on skeletal muscle function after 3 h ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in a rodent model.	1.9799896278771005
IP protocols using one, two, or three preconditioning cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion each, were compared to non-preconditioned controls.	2.088987185687143
IP was found to significantly improve force, performance, endurance, and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle.	2.2020864809618184
Preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles.	2.7465933457591043
Altogether, this study describes the efficacy of IP in improving post-ischemic muscle function and the need of more than one IP cycle to achieve this improvement.	2.3668990419924705
The respective clinical potential warrants further exploration.	2.265538559956903
Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a rare ectodermal dysplasia with variable expression.	2.579357002571928
The condition is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.	2.3581725507006195
Several classifications of PC have been proposed.	2.6078353136671346
Feinstein and colleagues suggested four clinical types of PC.	2.1946252530463757
Type II, the Jackson-Lawler-Syndrome, is characterized by multiple epidermal cysts, palmoplantar bullae and hyperhidrosis as well as natal teeth in addition to the main findings of pachyonychia, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and follicular keratosis.	2.171210972363539
We report two patients (father and son) with Jackson-Lawler-Syndrome and describe in detail pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches as well as the different classifications of pachyonychia congenita.	2.0309567526502628
Aim of this review article was to critically analyse the recently described zytogenetic and molecular markers for testicular germ cell tumors with regard to their clinical utility.	2.240304810297982
The isochromosome i(12p) represents the most common and characteristic cytogenetic finding which already appears in testicular carcinoma in situ.	2.050642662044489
Clinical characteristics of patients with familial testicular germ cell tumors indicate a genetic background for the development of testicular tumors.	2.8017580962226565
Although a number of chromsomal loci encoding potential testicular tumor susceptibility genes have been identified, the genetic basis of testicular cancer pathogenesis is still unknown.	2.101456025002925
With regard to molecular prognostic risk factors most of the reported data on proliferation markers, tumor suppressor genes, proteases and adhesion molecules have to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials prior to their widespread clinical use.	2.127484450497942
Based on the available data on prospective studies percentage of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion appear to be the most significant prognosticators.	2.3029361620236872
Investigation and identification of those factors determining the aggressive biologic behavior of embryonal carcinoma compared to all other histological components appear to be most promising in research for prognosticators of metastatic disease.	1.9415394749034167
After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, carbon dioxide (CO2) must be exhaled after resorption from the abdominal cavity.	2.0595655724029944
There is controversy about the amount and relevance of postoperative CO2 resorption.	2.184530610057858
Without continuous postoperative monitoring, after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a certain risk may consist in unnoticed hypercapnia due to CO2 resorption.	1.9525732418027038
Studies exist on the course of end-expiratory CO2 (PeCO2) alone over a longer postoperative period of time in extubated patients during spontaneous breathing.	2.278742071866648
The goal of this prospective study was to investigate the amount of CO2 resorbed from the abdominal cavity in the postoperative period by means of CO2 metabolism.	2.648272936753225
After giving informed consent to the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee, 20 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	2.505325247545534
All patients received general endotracheal anaesthesia.	2.315143192995581
After induction, total IV anaesthesia was maintained using fentanyl, propofol, and atracurium.	2.0342309627716038
Patients were ventilated with oxygen in air (FiO2 0.4).	2.1174615149255764
The intraabdominal pressure during the surgical procedure ranged from 12 to 14 mm Hg.	2.317010229527828
Thirty minutes after releasing the capnoperitoneum (KP), CO2 elimination (V.CO2), oxygen uptake (V.O2), and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured every minute for 1 h by indirect calorimetry using the metabolic monitor Deltatrac according to the principle of Canopy.	2.067422985672178
Assuming an unchanged metabolism, the CO2 resorption (V.CO2) at any given time (t) can be calculated from V.CO2 (t)=V.CO2 (t)-RQ (preop) V.O2 (t).	2.1026872552993088
It was thus necessary to define the patient's metabolism on the day of operation.	2.3856452695322896
The first data were collected before surgery and after introduction of the arterial and venous cannulae for a 15-min period.	2.386603319858131
Measuring point 0 was determined after exsufflation of the KP and emptying of the remaining CO2 via manual compression by the surgeon at the end of surgery.	2.1295067669196763
Patient's tracheas were extubated and metabolic monitoring started 30 min after release of the KP for 60 min.	2.0841860226111395
Simultaneously, a nasal side-stream capnometry probe was placed and the PeCO2 and respiratory frequency (RF) were obtained by the Capnomac Ultima (Datex) and registered every minute as well.	1.8252041008684252
Values were averaged over four periods of 15 min each.	2.214124478897403
An arterial blood gas sample was drawn at the end of every 15-min period.	2.407538705245415
Postoperative pain was scored by a visual analog scale and completed by a subjective index questionnaire on general well-being.	2.033691879615567
All data were analysed by the Friedman or Wilcoxon test; P<0.05 was considered significant.	2.011580929823455
The findings do not indicate CO2 resorption in the postoperative period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Tables 2 and 3, Fig.	2.1974677727411467
Arterial CO2 as well as PeCO2 were elevated postoperatively (45 mm Hg vs. 36 mm Hg intraoperatively), while V.CO2 and V.O2 were unchanged when compared to the preoperative measuring period.	2.244493544580955
The postoperative RF was comparable to preoperative values.	2.3960388029302973
Calculated CO2 was lower than 10 ml/min and within accuracy of measurements.	2.6971684452558318
The postoperative pain index ranged between 3 and 4, and 3.75 - 15 mg piritramid was administered.	2.0351554031604464
All patients feld tired immediately after the operation, but scores improved slightly at the end of the 60-min period of metabolic monitoring.	2.255555622738521
There is no significant resorption of CO2 from the abdominal cavity later than 30 min after releasing the KP.	2.098611070146117
Up to this time, any CO2 remaining in the abdominal cavity after careful emptying by the surgeon has been resorbed and exhaled.	2.0132811622030755
The gene of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-inhibitor p16INK4A (CDKN2/MTS1) has been proposed as a candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21, a frequently deleted region in a series of human cancers including malignant melanoma.	1.804281193522748
An increasing and sometimes conflicting body of data has accumulated regarding the frequency of homozygous deletions and mutations as well as the importance of p16INK4A in malignant melanoma.	2.3505059056480904
The purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on p16INK4A and to discuss its biologic significance in the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumors.	2.2062886675799285
The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in HIV-infected patients is high.	2.302795877814217
The differential diagnosis includes psychoreactive disorders, acute psychiatric symptoms of an HIV-associated encephalopathy, and symptomatic psychotic illnesses due to secondary neurologic manifestations such as opportunistic central nervous infections and intracerebral lymphoma.	1.7706657624457316
Secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging (CT, MRI) and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid.	2.369995224616827
In emergency situations, however, German law imposes strict regulations, especially in the case of sectioned patients.	2.6463358592600907
These medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and propositions for an effective strategy are made.	1.9896409639931827
In simultaneous bilateral nerve recordings, patients with Sympathetically Maintained Pain (SMP) affecting one limb show similar sympathetic traffic in nerves supplying the affected and unaffected limb, also when the painful limb shows a marked regional autonomic (vasomotor) dysfunction.	1.7323760942039004
These findings argue against the notion that SMP must be mediated by a reflex change in the pattern of sympathetic discharge.	2.0364712269685983
In general, they underline the fact that autonomic effector disturbances may give little information about underlying nerve traffic.	2.0317522160534485
Intraoperative transluminal angioplasty (ITA) has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction, fulfils the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years.	2.0106281677896347
Whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature, reports on the procedural management of ITA are rare.	2.5815693957354076
In the following, the technique of ortho- and retrograde sheath implantation, either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft, is described in detail.	1.965549738793579
By respecting particular standards for sheath introduction, ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ITA can be kept to a minimum.	1.8473160854237796
In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated.	2.018991786206091
In spite of new developments, including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon, the "ideal" angioplasty access sheath is, as yet, not available.	1.995728628147921
In several cases of lupus erythematosus (SLE, SCLE, DLE), the Koebner phenomenon could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas, scratching effects, operation scars, contact dermatitis, pressure from sock tops, application of liquid nitrogen, exposure to strong sun light, etc.	1.917584038493266
The interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case.	1.9580209357730027
In SLE patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, the Koebner phenomenon could not be found, while it was detected in patients with generalized DLE who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones.	2.3503259278025275
It was not seen in patients with localized DLE.	3.0036878014521187
There was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the Koebner phenomenon.	2.4041300858641192
With regard to the histopathogenesis of the Koebner phenomenon, it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network, with expression of adhesion molecules, might be involved.	2.298505519878453
The Koebner phenomenon may be a valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus.	2.5928599192150874
In 5 years 9 patients with a total of 16 painful ear nodules (chondrodermatitis helicis) have been treated as follows.	2.5074217326141897
A small excision is carried out with local anaesthesia for histological examination.	2.418899254336471
The rest of the nodule or any other nodules are carbonized by means of the argon laser, also with local anaesthesia, including the surface of the cartilage under the nodules.	2.222411825807744
There have been no cases of postoperative inflammation or infection.	2.102689970015983
There have been no real recurrences.	2.255976811240373
The cosmetic result is very good in all cases.	2.4692694405170132
The patients are free of pain immediately after the laser therapy.	2.5076202632169213
Laser therapy for painful nodules of the ear has good and lasting results, with a lower rate of recurrences than any other form of treatment.	2.249575996340341
We represent and discuss etiology, diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous orchtitis referring to an actual case of this rare disease.	2.335744746453231
In the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease.	2.399442638976699
Other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease.	2.204390762028753
Quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection veils the sterile leucocyturia as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis.	1.990233798086778
Imaging diagnostics frequently fails to give indications of tuberculous origin of the lesion.	2.3546396249957513
Despite required microbiological cultivation to make a resistogram the polymerase chain reaction is a high sensitive and comparable fast method for detection of Mycobacteria even from tissue.	2.049941511444439
In surgical procedures associated with high blood loss, such as vascular and cardiac operations, differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance.	2.574101900425532
Preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders [drug-induced platelet disorders (in particular ASS), von Willebrand's disease and other congenital platelet disorders] is effective in minimizing blood loss.	2.120434282301157
Bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance.	1.9309119777992907
Therefore, simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems.	2.2678525381053665
The aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding.	2.1519450760853895
Although deep vein thrombosis now has a better prognosis than in the era before anticoagulation, a number of patients remain in whom ulcus cruris cannot be adequately controlled by conservative treatment.	2.3000670274072483
The case report of a 50-year-old woman with stage III chronic venous insufficiency associated with the post-thrombotic syndrome is presented.	2.43352994240438
Progress in imaging techniques and functional diagnostics of the post-thrombotic syndrome make a reliable differentiation of the chronic venous insufficiency possible with respect to obstruction or reflux.	2.3515359478217714
If conservative treatment fails, autological valve transplantation is described as a suitable reconstructive management method in the treatment of reflux.	2.309609001173273
Following this report, the results and limitations of this method are discussed.	2.9705044751139993
The neurobiological alterations commonly found in affective disorders (e.g., alterations in the nocturnal sleep profile, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system) gradually recover with improvement of the depressive syndrome.	1.968215940917466
In order to test this hypothesis, we designed a prospective study in which healthy first-degree relatives (high-risk probands; HRPs; n=54) of patients with an affective disorder are investigated by means of polysomnography, the combined dexamethasone and corticotropine-releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test and a variety of psychometric scales.	2.1492184843588764
In the present part of the study (index assessment), these HRPs, as a group, showed depressionlike alterations in both the sleep pattern and the DEX-CRH-test outcome; furthermore, their psychometric profile was characterized by elevated scores on the scales assessing "rigidity" and "autonomic lability".	1.9775878223116936
On a single-case level, 35% of the HRPs were identified as conspicuous (depressionlike) in at least two of the three areas investigated.	2.1679973072654883
A decision of whether or not this "conspicuousness" indeed represents a trait marker for affective disorders can be reached when the follow-up part of the study has identified those HRPs with their respective premorbide status who have developed an affective disorder in the meantime.	2.180305638658404
Undifferentiated connective tissue disease with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in a 33 year old woman after recurrent arterial thromboses, two miscarriages and myocarditis.	2.040042595601793
Despite effective immunosuppression and anticoagulation her initially mild precapillary pulmonary hypertension progressed in the absence of thromboembolic events, cardiopulmonary disease or other systemic disorders.	1.995930788062289
iloprost in a dosage of up to 4.5 ng/kg/min for a total of 15 months, her 6 min walking-distance improved from 210 to 315 m, the pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 1710 to 1111 dynxsxcm-5 and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 64 to 54 mmHg.	1.987459506721611
This partial success of conservative treatment enabled a reassessment of the necessity for heart and lung transplantation.	2.1813253173520213
In the USA, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been approved for therapy of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within a 3 hour time window based on the results of the NINDS [1] trial.	2.3102501685926913
Only few patients with AIS are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms, and only 3% of these patients qualify for treatment with rt-PA.	2.4077717623846713
Therefore, only few patients with AIS will potentially benefit from therapy with rt-PA if NINDS criteria are applied.	2.1005241019959846
The goal of the Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in AIS for a 6 hour time window.	2.011808625742503
Objective: To prove the response and side effects of sulphasalazine in early and late onset juvenile pauciarthritis, also the therapeutic effect dependent on the marker HLA B27.	2.156733068763551
The radiologic imaging methods play an important role in the precise staging as basic requirement for an effective concept of tumor therapy.	2.127313834143824
The accuracy of ultrasound in the primary staging according to the TNM-classification (UICC) was therefore prospectively investigated in 260 patients with head and neck tumors of the clinical stages T1N0 to T4N3.	2.393741182917681
The clinically (C1) and sonographically (C2) evaluated pretherapeutic stages were compared to the postoperative histopathologic tumor classifications.	2.116286229469165
The clinical staging was correct in 75.0 %, high in 7.7 %, low in 17.3 %, the N-stages were correct in 59.2 %, high in 17.7 %, low in 23.1 %.	1.8463300759974344
The sonographic staging was apparently superior with the T-classifications correct in 92.3 %, high in 7.7 %, low 0.0 %.	1.938901910898262
The N-stages were correct in 89.6 %, high in 9.2 %, low in 1.2 %.	2.0845602779956227
The accuracy of combined TN classification rose from clinical 46.5 % to 84.6 % by sonography.	1.9110361117195134
Accompanying inflammations, foregoing biopsies and tooth extractions were the main reasons for incorrect staging.	2.1338846361615236
Therefore, the thorough sonographic investigation performed after the clinical examination and before invasive procedures, due to little patient discomfort, good availability and high accuracy, is an excellent sectional imaging method for staging, therapy-planning and follow up of tumors of the head and neck especially of the orofacial regions.	2.198367101242008
Standardized guidelines for exercise training for patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) have not been established.	2.7647573953830795
In the past CHF patients involved in exercise training studies demonstrated a wide range of cardiac and functional impairment, with an ejection fraction between 18 and 35% and a peak VO2 between 12.2 and 25.4 ml/kg/min on average.	2.0041130265986293
For determination of training intensity, a VO2 between 40 and 70% of peak VO2 and/or training heart rate between 60 and 80% of peak heart rate was used.	2.1158154376814355
There was also a wide range for frequency (between 3 and 7 times per week) and duration of training (between 20 and 60 min per session).	2.102101022784008
For aerobic exercise training only continuous training methods were applied.	2.216055306072299
We have developed a new interval training method which allows intense exercise stimuli on peripheral muscles with minimal cardiac strain.	1.886725055739034
After only three weeks of training, the improvement in aerobic capacity was similar to that reported after longer training periods using continuous methods.	2.0064291371694924
To determine work rate for work phases of interval training, a special steep ramp test was developed.	1.9507040495072854
By analysis of acute physical responses to this testing procedure and to the interval training, both were proven to be tolerable in CHF patients, even if their ejection fraction is as low as 13%, or peak cardiac index not greater than 1.6 l/m2/min, and peak VO2 less than 8.5 ml/kg/min.	2.015646573035072
Small (T1) and exophytic (T1, T2) tumors are suitable for radiotherapy.	2.0891642308523894
Limited lesions (T1, T2) can be cured by functional endoscopic resection techniques or external partial laryngectomies.	2.0995406044640044
Extensive tumors (large T2; T3) are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation, especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy.	2.3383713365779846
When radiation treatment fails, surgery succeeds in more than half of the cases.	2.372437925965164
Tumors infiltrating or transgressing the laryngeal framework (T4) can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy.	2.0478493947827032
Subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts.	1.9900754818077093
Inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases, with the exception of early glottic cancer.	2.7817110316489355
Induced hypotension is defined as a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 50-60 mm Hg in normotensive subjects.	2.523380062163872
The aim of induced hypotension is to decrease intraoperative blood loss, decrease the need for blood transfusions and improve operating conditions.	2.2758137012862
Most studies indicate that induced hypotension can decrease intraoperative blood loss by 50% in many surgical procedures; however, some studies report that blood loss is not significantly reduced.	1.9904641173778903
Current methods of induced hypotension are based on the use of rapid and short-acting vasodilators as primary agents (nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, urapidil), supplemented by volatile anesthetics (isoflurane) and/or -blockers (esmolol) to improve effect, reduce dosage and prevent side effects (reflex tachycardia, tachyphylaxis, rebound hypertension).	2.0239735138984947
Proper positioning of the patient and controlled ventilation aid in reducing blood loss.	2.691897260287414
Major risks of induced hypotension are a reduction in blood flow (i.e.	2.6604948870984564
ischaemia) of vital organs (brain, myocardium) and elevation of intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients.	2.145427974905972
Thus, major contraindications of induced hypotension are severe coronary artery disease, hypertension combined with arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels and increased intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral disease.	2.3201147464542013
Complications are rare in otherwise healthy patients, but may be higher in elderly patients and those with underlying organ dysfunction.	2.6355524646352655
Therefore, careful assessment and selection of patients, together with consideration of the potential complications, appropriate choice of drugs and invasive beatby-beat monitoring, are essential for the safe practice of induced hypotension.	2.270533703892848
Abstract  Empirical results stemming from infant research have contributed extensively to the understanding of coping with psychosocial stress and vulnerability for psychosomatic symptoms in later life.	1.8849840612397595
The interaction and the emotional exchange between caregiver and child in the first months of life lead to representations of interactions that will be the base for the quality of attachment.	2.167549878862871
The mutual regulation of the caregiver-infant-pair enables the child to acquire a psychic capacity to regulate physiological requirements.	1.9303683238430487
This selfregulatory function determines the potential of the later adult to react to distress - in a symbolic way using words or more in a somatic way by developing psychosomatic symptoms.	1.8665601809602141
First experiences with the treatment of psychosomatic patients with respect to the new findings about self-regulation are reported.	2.7204067291850107
A 31-year-old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction.	2.357413118686472
The patient's preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before.	2.4665787433526063
The physical examination - including sonography of the two fetuses - showed no pathological signs.	2.268399216894867
Anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side, using routine precautions pre-oxygenation, and rapid sequence intubation, and was maintained unproblematically.	2.0245978935297453
About 20 min after the onset of surgery, hypotension, tachycardia, and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared.	2.6610951629282353
Volume substitution and the application of vasoactive drugs failed to stabilise the haemodynamic situation.	2.3054655713128223
Elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left tilzing of the operating table did not lead to improvement.	2.1564975627488217
The development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction.	2.5881263179434795
The patient was treated successfully with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids (prednisolone).	1.9767686698432958
The suspicion of latex-related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio-allergen-sorbent test (RAST) and prick and scratch tests.	1.7673064108667758
The mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation.	2.3632347273900414
The heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy.	2.266796804114424
During late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position.	2.428686446134215
A fall in heart rate was only seen in this period.	2.5407108502005222
A fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy.	2.309462384247395
The hypotensive symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy.	2.01321072161216
Headaches, fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints.	2.4503960235304354
The frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation.	2.2537912075349995
Blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women.	2.2608874927008724
However, the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position.	2.394152772513411
The Birth-weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position, but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing.	2.2568506825180257
Pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight.	2.159965911734992
These results imply a hitherto unknown cause of intrauterine growth restriction.	2.08702180591036
The combination of saltwater baths and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation is an effective treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.	2.108890948763842
The aim of the present study was to determine the photosensitizing properties of two commercially available bath salts, original salt from the Dead Sea and sodium chloride.	1.8429641581421812
To address this issue, test areas on the volar aspects of the forearms were soaked with salt solutions for 15 minutes prior to ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation.	1.8498722139928885
The salt concentrations tested were 1%, 3% 5% and 15%.	2.2780861239463066
Tap water followed by UVB and UVB alone served as controls.	2.0665877027562365
Erythema was determined by visual and photometric measurement, and delayed tanning was assessed by colorimetry.	2.2353241328355278
Erythema obtained by wetting the skin prior to UVB irradiation was more pronounced than erythema induced by UVB alone.	1.9829546879952056
The most prominent erythema was yielded by tap water+UVB.	2.058779260311713
The salts had a differing photosensitizing capacity and the strongest erythema was produced by the 5% solutions.	2.033339028814497
There was only a moderate influence on delayed tanning by bathing the skin prior to irradiation.	1.9941408302404713
The results from the present study indicate that soaking the skin with salt solutions or tap water increases skin sensitivity to subsequent UVB irradiation.	2.140545120427437
This may contribute to the effectiveness of salt water baths followed by UV irradiation and may account for an increased sunburn risk after bathing.	2.2351728284457644
Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis, e. g. early elective resection and primary anastomosis.	2.3821114161250834
Methods: The data of 445 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified Hinchey classification (stages 0-III).	1.943774651685043
Results: Within our study group the morbidity was 26.5 % (n = 118) and the mortality was 1.6 % (n = 7).	2.2574116999246687
In 96 % (n = 425) of all cases and in 64 % (21/33) of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis (stage III), a primary anastomosis was performed.	2.5047099380179096
Four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis (0.9 %).	2.786651031112866
No leakage was observed from any of the anastomoses performed in stage III diverticulitis.	2.3021738240355747
Stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality.	2.3619783067949665
Some 53 % (94/177) of the patients in stage II and 67 % (22/33) of the patients in stage III had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before.	2.473077837807732
Conclusion: Prophylactic surgery to avoid life-threatening situations, including abscess formation or perforation, is not possible in many cases.	2.3632282869222347
However, especially patients at risk (age, coexisting illness) should undergo early surgery.	2.2000934640715695
Primary anastomosis can be performed safely even at an advanced stage.	2.452377630270742
To evaluate whether MRI is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined.	1.9191890006176637
Tumor staging by CT and MR imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium.	2.324607194703067
In MRI 4 out of 7 thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy, in CT none.	2.1209188735297566
In advanced renal carcinoma MRI with Gadolinium was superior to CT imaging, especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus.	2.225174609708129
Consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by MRI which therefore may replace conventional cavography.	2.290526410326789
Children of mothers chronically infected with hepatitis-C-virus (HCV) during pregnancy and delivery were prospectively followed.	2.112489957828769
90 children born to 85 infected mothers were included in our study; nine of the mothers were known to be co-infected with HIV-1.	2.327924289229322
These 90 children were first tested within 60 days after birth and followed for at least three months.	2.194183027712251
Three of the 90 children became infected perinatally with HCV as shown by persistence of antibodies after 2 years of life and a positive result in the RT-PCR.	2.1899746138991216
One of these 3 children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase values, but is otherwise clinically well, likewise the other 2 infected children.	1.8308330081219133
54 of the 87 uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year.	2.181644923797923
Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital malformation in which a membrane divides the right atrium into two chambers.	2.4638680332128096
The membrane represents a persistence of the right sinus venosus valve (RSV).	2.3653421744196383
Normally the RSV regresses between the 9th and 15th week of gestation, as the cephalic portion forms the crista terminalis and the caudal portion develops into the Eustachian and Thebesian valve.	1.7878512909411022
Any failure in the regression process may result in remnants of RSV as a simple muscle bar, a Chiari-network or a fenestrated or unfenestrated membrane (cor triatriatum dexter).	1.7998024495142493
We describe a patient with cor triatriatum dexter in whom diagnosis was made several years after successful valvulotomy procedure for severe congenital valvular pulmonary stenosis.	1.9219903581839677
Therefore, dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters.	2.1160684640741327
However, since only few data are available from previous studies, we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism.	2.4492588324813043
Apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the ISEL-technique and topoisomerase II  expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody Ki-S1.	2.002139880797326
Furthermore, by determination of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen labeling (PCNA) index, we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase, because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle.	2.0345266860690785
Patients with IMF, PV, and ET revealed a normal range of apoptosis, whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) a significant increase could be observed.	2.1265638390973116
On the other hand, IMF and PV were characterized by a raised proliferative activity.	2.0851993188639906
Dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index.	2.3584460652391863
In CML and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable, but IMF and PV showed a significant increase.	2.22055944837493
Survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation.	2.398785335712361
In conclusion, our in-situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics.	1.9789482657217596
In this context, a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and/or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome.	2.319880567833523
In a complex animal model in sheep, polydioxanone (PDS) and polylactic membranes were used for the reconstruction of large orbital-wall defects.	1.9975333567038525
In a long-term experiment over 1 year, polylactic implants alone showed the best performance as compared with combinations involving autogenous bone grafts and titanium miniplate fixation.	2.102947237647822
As soon as these polylactic implants are approved for human surgery, they will be used to solve the still challenging problem of anatomical reconstruction of large comminuted fractures of more than one orbital wall.	2.087184530839426
We inserted a 3-D endoscope into a jet laryngoscope and studied the pressure properties at the tip of the laryngoscope as well as intrapulmonary pressures while applying superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation.	2.226565558778018
The studies were conducted initially using a lung simulator, and then in seven patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery.	2.1079865455954723
Due to the rather large 3-D endoscope, the diameter of the jet laryngoscope was reduced by between 25.2% and 70.9%, depending on its size.	2.138864404845059
The measurements on the lung simulator revealed that reduction of laryngoscope diameter leads to an increase in the following parameters: expiratory resistance, tidal volume, and peak inspiratory pressure.	2.196945869532709
The mean FiO2 was 0.74 +/- 0.1; the mean paO2 was 169.2 +/- 80.4 mm Hg; and the mean paCO2 was 40.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg.	1.821961233090287
The mean airway pressure was 19 +/- 5.3 mm Hg prior to insertion of the endoscope and 12.3 +/- 6.9 mm Hg after insertion.	1.94414079703281
The mean positive end-expiratory pressure values increased from 2 +/- 0.6 to 3.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg.	2.0513448058991557
Reduction of the working pressure resulted in restoration of the initial inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes.	2.1575735581916486
In the clinical application of 3-D endoscopy via a jet laryngoscope, it was possible to achieve sufficient ventilation, inspection of the surgical field, and performance of the surgical procedure.	2.493197695529637
A CO2 laser was used without changing the ventilation regime.	2.1983519964978355
Although technical alterations would be desirable for its application to microlaryngeal surgery, it is presently possible to safely use the 3-D endoscope via the jet laryngoscope for microlaryngeal surgery, presenting the surgeon with new possibilities in voice-improving microsurgery of the larynx.	2.0284018730384417
Kryopreserved specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips.	2.276127400284076
The cystic duct was fixed, and the transverse placed clips were distracted in axial direction and the forces registered.	2.1640345431921664
The median values of the six investigated clips ranged between 4.1 N and 11.2 N with a highly significant difference (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA).	1.9689017781010576
In detail, both resorbable clips (polydioxanone, polyglyconate/polyglycol acetate) were superior to the four titanium clips (P < 0.005, Wilcoxon test).	1.8574883283883932
In addition to the advantage of complete biodegradibility, these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips.	2.212168856672631
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.	2.119365101765151
The efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to O2 transport and especially the effective O2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations, such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.	2.4023263420952734
A degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here.	2.186909605879628
In spite of this, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.	2.1680224353892075
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are, therefore, well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.	2.1614832913117272
The capacity for the release of O2 to the tissues is especially excellent.	2.2634928857224725
This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation.	2.0664858244939315
Perflubron, the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in man and is well tolerated.	2.4940590412463894
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients.	2.008340697071987
Launch is expected within the next few years.	2.4114795809947247
The new volatile anaesthetic desflurane is characterized by very low blood-gas and tissue-blood partition coefficients, so that rapid induction of anaesthesia and shorter recovery times can be expected.	2.189768820412802
The aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of desflurane and isoflurane on haemodynamics and recovery time when used as part of a balanced anaesthesia technique for elective surgery.	2.110661885203479
In acute coronary syndromes, arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density.	2.1416413748808543
The underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear.	2.2981054144458217
Among others, increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.	2.1886385191392392
Coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined, using immunohistochemistry (TUNEL test to detect fragmented DNA) and transmission electron microscopy.	2.2014308936147953
On occasion of the 100th anniversary of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in Russia in the years from 1926 to 1937.	1.9502748414142814
These operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation.	2.411862883796156
This work pioneered by Russian scientist S. Brukhonenko and the Surgeon N. Terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public.	1.8307443839941897
The first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than 260 operations on the valves of the open heart, the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism, and principles of open heart surgery stated by N. Terebinski were decades ahead of the development at the time.	2.0877278547117237
In the authors' opinion they represent a milestone in the history of open heart surgery.	2.1859798785322866
Aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare.	2.7855388126007923
The literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations.	2.105834341209998
In the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right-sided intrapetrous aneurym after myringotomy, which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media.	2.0835612571749653
Due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible.	2.474406420227049
Subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms.	2.488313626810274
Leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle, fascia lata and a gelatin-resorcin-formalin-glue (Cardial).	1.7658691995400244
In order to apply the tissue patch the hypotympanic site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior otosurgical approach.	1.9733974287830325
Due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries.	1.9006212300723773
Temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm.	2.292634770831639
Following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy.	2.0963512680854675
Blindness causes human suffering and high social costs.	2.3067734622032083
Virtually all blind people are registered with the social services.	2.290913212214175
Data from these institutions may help in (long-term) planning for blindness prevention.	2.3647743162585
The stage-oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice.	2.2894860615679136
Nowadays, partial stem varicosis, which is an earlier stage of the disease, leads to operative treatment more frequently than 10 years ago; thus a sufficient vein stump remains after surgical treatment.	2.3059840956252655
After surgery on a group of 1000 patients, we examined the stumps for patency, the occurrence of varicose changes, for their availability in the long term, and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery.	2.2359233522472746
The treatment of insufficient perforant veins was also included in the surgical therapy, as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins.	2.4223087697706163
Thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions.	2.088083583875169
This study supports the call for the stage-oriented surgical treatment of stem varicosis.	2.2938209823303803
Background: Corneal HLA-DR antigens are going to be lost during organ culture storage.	2.063301179903639
This study investigated if this phenomenon is based on down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen, or on a loss of the HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells (LCs).	2.0414233670700845
The authors present a rare case of solitary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the skull of an 11-year-old girl.	2.418821387838458
The clinical, radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report.	2.7582593790109162
The morphological features of intra- and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging.	2.2011550671232123
Although rare, NHL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children.	2.286812231408404
Neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age.	2.2232159855542593
Despite progress in the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, definite diagnosis for most of these disorders is still possible only by neuropathological examination of the brain.	2.514525802711116
The neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years, particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies, resulting in the development of new disease-specific antibodies.	2.67690539811732
To obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis, particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies, studies with clinically and neuropathologically well-documented cases are needed.	2.3593628593818083
The project "Brain-Net" has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a German Brain and Tissue Bank for Diseases of the Central Nervous System.	1.9443740884336502
The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.	2.045132983548127
Fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the unborn child's life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally.	1.9869458961626798
Such surgery is a clinical reality now.	2.75192226997852
Indications for intrataurine surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities, especially in the upper respiratory tract.	2.523816020120419
These include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias, prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary overdistension, and resection of embryonic tumors that obstruct the respiratory tract.	2.0199664887724236
The relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques.	1.9743345793651528
Endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance.	2.096837364629603
In part of the procedures, only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use.	2.4278036681308044
Further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions, even in cases with non-lethal conditions.	2.7968850260446176
More diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications.	2.857874071143496
One example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate, which until now has only been performed in animal experiments.	2.07461603306977
The particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy.	2.0289974309443983
This offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is invisible externally and avoids growth-impeding scars.	1.9659191450213238
The particular ethical and legal aspects of fetal surgery are discussed.	2.2433763540448415
We report on a 57-year-old patient suffering from a complex malposition of proximal femur after osteosynthesis using a condylar plate.	2.0805179401995457
For polyaxial correction of the proximal femur we successfully used an intramedullary hip screw system.	2.4448988233163815
In 6 patients with primary malignant bone tumors (4 Ewing, 1 recurrent Adamantinoma, 1 maligne Haemangioperizytoma) the local therapy was performed as intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation.	1.90618972116003
During the follow-up 10 (6-24) months no local recurrence in the replanted segment occurred.	2.4724938792889866
One recurrence occurred in the host bed; in two cases the replanted segment had to be removed because of severe infection.	2.6365949585451482
The other cases showed good functional and radiological results.	2.5485160511279608
These clinical findings and the reports in the literature seem to allow the application of the intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation procedure for defect reconstruction in cases of chemo- and radiotherapy-sensitive bone tumors.	2.3365583830123566
Effects of anaesthesia and analgesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality remain controversial.	2.5442998504067695
Numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.	2.0645401840409927
In patients undergoing vascular surgery, epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative hypercoagulability.	2.1774985122815353
These patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re-operation.	2.5856757593249675
However, regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies.	1.9746347961677897
One reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care.	2.0831250739523415
A multimodal therapeutic approach, which consists of preoperativ patient information, sufficient analgesia, early mobilisation and enteral feeding, may solve this discrepancy.	1.9425055070648138
Therefore, prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome.	2.7184115192985625
Although cerebrovascular diseases are the most common causes of dementia after Alzheimer's desease, vascular dementia (VD) has remained so far an ill-defined term.	2.0561394730415357
The main problems in the definition of VD arise from finding criteria for both terms "vascular" and "dementia".	2.1920008625429683
The detailed criteria for the diagnosis of VD proposed by several groups or institutions (ADDTC, DSM-IV, ICD-10, NINDS-ARIEN) are critically reviewed.	2.17497145419549
The diagnostic value of some clinical findings, especially the very frequent white matter luciencies in CT (leuko-araiosis), are discussed.	2.102058810851017
The available studies suggest a differentiation of VD into some subtypes (listed according to frequency): subcortical VD, VD with acute onset, multiinfarct-dementia, mixed types, and specific forms.	1.733078213998071
Nevertheless, these subtypes give only little information about the etiology of the underlying vascular process and, therefore, no clear indication for specific therapeutic strategies.	2.324993795702342
The aetiology of varicosis is still unclear.	2.3657064074585876
Investigation of changes in normal veins which result in the formation of varicosis led to examination of elastic properties and histomorphological alterations in the region of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall of the long saphenous vein in normal and varicose veins.	2.2199533560778852
The rigidity of varicose veins was higher than that of normal veins; there was no difference between the varicose vein above a competent valve and the "normal" vein below this competent valve.	2.0922560312293332
The matrix proteins demonstrated an increase in total fibres, whereas the elastic fibres were reduced and fragmented, explained the rigidity of varices.	2.248320950692468
These results suggest that the role of the venous valves in the development of varicose veins is secondary to changes of the vein wall.	2.7247054531820822
An investigation of 122 knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the meniscofemoral ligaments (MFL) Humphry and Wrisberg.	1.9707773290293777
Of the knees examined, 96% showed one or more ligaments, the incidence was independent of gender or age.	2.2359797999046056
The osseous parameters of the dorsal and ventral notch as well as the diacondylar width did not correlate with the incidence of MFL.	2.6974546660806014
The ventral notch width index (NWI) after Souryal was 0.22 in females and 0.24 in males.	1.8470814385787167
A dorsal notch width index (dNWI), which has not been described so far, was 0.26 in females and 0.28 in males.	2.2899693671991725
The ligamentum meniscofemorale posterius (Wrisberg) showed distinct morphological variations.	2.017449886580172
This resulted in a classification of type I-III.	3.0513176856320205
The results of the study underline the importance of the MFL for knee joint function including stabilization, proprioception, and meniscal positioning.	2.204787387729643
Eleven patients with high-grade mucosal dysplasia in a columnar-lined oesophagus and 2 patients with a squamous carcinoma (uT1) underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT) and argon-plasma coagulation (APC).	2.0997423071846275
For PDT, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was given orally (60 mg/kg) and treated endoscopically with a light dose of 150 J/cm2 (100 mW/cm2) at 635 nm 4-6 h later.	2.1126692505578912
A second PDT was performed under the same conditions 2-3 weeks later.	2.3728826409043116
Patients who received APC were treated 4 times on average to reach radical Barrett mucosa eradication.	1.9339735181804312
All patients were consistently given medication to suppress acid production.	2.0204676610842784
No complications occurred in either group.	2.316267165215771
Follow-up endoscopies and multiple biopsies for 3-42 months showed squamous regeneration in the dysplastic columnar-lined oesophagus in all 11 patients.	1.8062757507477938
PDT with 5-ALA-induced endogenous porphyrins, as well as APC combined with omeprazole protection, can eradicate superficial high-grade dysplastic mucosa in Barrett's oesophagus.	2.157967106116973
However, we did not succeed in destroying a manifest carcinoma.	1.9967513122122431
Technical advantages of spiral technology are of great usefulness in diagnostic imaging of thorax and abdomen in children.	2.049888887011284
The rapid imaging time allows the examination of an entire organ while scanning with breath holding or while the child is quietly breathing, resulting in a decreased need for sedation.	1.934496317579603
In addition especially examinations of the chest an to some extend CT-investigations of the abdomen are performed with reduced radiation dose achieved by reducing the tube loading.	2.090987166226538
Radiation dose reduction of 70% is possible without loss of relevant diagnostic information.	2.219405840618908
Spiral low-dose CT in pediatric chest imaging is useful in evaluating parenchymal lung diseases, mediastinal masses and central airway malformations.	2.0445826572715364
Whether abdominal helical CT can be replaced by MRI has to be decided in each individual case.	2.3567540590488596
When an exact protocol is used, sufficient contrast material given, scan-delay optimized and postprocessing reconstructions are performed, usefull additional diagnostic informations are obtained by the method.	1.893478305985421
Invasive monitoring is a standard procedure in modern intensive care medicine.	2.65330433327239
Despite significant progress in the routine use and catheter technology, there are relevant remaining risks concerning acute central venous and arterial access and chronic persistence of catheters within the vascular lumen.	2.09074331131191
Resulting from the infectiologically established novel definition of antiseptic which contains the local application of antiseptics for prophylactical, preventive or therapeutical indication on skin, mucous membrane, wounds, in body cavities or on surgical exposed resp.	1.6888360986141422
opened endosomatic areas the antiseptical indications in a branch of dermatology and venereal diseases are represented.	1.9363704156948807
With the analysis of the actual knowledge in vitro and in vivo requirements to local antiinfectiva are defined combined with the recommendations for the clinical use.	2.450228851030538
At present mainly prophylactically used agents are submitted to a benefit risk analysis with refer to the choice of agents.	2.0051764775491305
Thereby agents for the application on skin as well as on genitals, in mouth cavity and on wounds were taken into consideration.	2.303352928329308
Hydatid disease, still frequent in endemic areas, is usually localized in the liver.	2.2657429311281745
Despite the benign nature of the disease it is one of the problematic fields of surgery due to the high complication rate and long hospital stay.	2.7354324428252172
Based on our experience we recommend evacuation of the cyst and omentoplasty as the surgical method of choice, as it is associated with a relatively low incidence of complications and can be performed easily.	2.5999415160311434
Background: Central catheters in neonatological intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of medicataion or parenteral infusions.	2.1923452459866084
Dislocations and septic and thromboembolic complications may occur.	2.3718239033736763
Low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in particle size, density, and physical as well as chemical properties.	2.31129058811482
Regarding size and density, LDL can be divided into two main profiles, LDL pattern A with elevated concentration of large, buoyant LDL particles and LDL pattern B with increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles.	1.8159775774368143
The latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of HDL and particularly HDL2 cholesterol.	1.982420947524312
The LDL profile of increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.	2.268500242758563
The LDL profile is partly genetically determined, but can be improved by non-pharmacological (exercise, diet) and pharmacological intervention.	2.1574137821761967
It remains to be confirmed whether the LDL subfraction profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides HDL2 cholesterol and triglycerides, but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk.	1.914092426067758
Traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia.	2.199638575400544
In the hand, which is perfused by two arteries, this symptom could be missed.	2.3890207421526406
The hypothenar hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal arteria ulnaris.	2.662241279346668
Dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late.	2.638645132467561
A specific angiographic or duplex sonographic diagnostic investigation is necessary to show the arterial occlusion.	2.324813220151286
There is no proven therapeutic procedure.	2.2775221869876834
Exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention.	3.3456872225095458
The administration of epidural opioids is alternatively used in the management of postoperative analgesia.	2.6138881913346004
However, the administration is associated with side effects, including respiratory depression, somnolence and pruritus.	2.517793665940922
Thus, the administration of the lipophilic opioid sufentanil might has some advantages.	2.370648516017746
Notwithstanding, epidural opioid administration alone offers no marked clinical advantages compared to the intravenous route.	2.3001400710065334
In future, reduced doses of lipophilic opioids and local anaesthetics like bupivacaine 0.05-0.1% may provide benefits over the use of either drug alone and may offer marked clinical advantages over the intravenous route of opioids alone.	1.9534491774188945
The same holds true for  2-adrenoceptor agonists as adjuvants.	2.1307253062981957
However, multicenter dose-ranging studies are necessary to determine both the ideal concentrations of the drug combinations and the general outcome.	2.2412219751893203
Moreover, we must also determine cost effectiveness for our postoperative analgesic techniques.	2.12921142566584
Today the relevance of renal tumor embolization is not determined only by the technical and clinical success of the method.	2.323504395567053
Progress in diagnosis of early stages of renal carcinomas as well as the improvement of both surgical techniques and anesthetic procedures have lead to a change in the selection of patients for embolization.	2.9317653791220906
Preoperative embolization of advanced renal cell carcinomas with tumor thrombus into the vena cava or of T4 tumors is now an established clinical procedure.	1.9781984695815558
The complete occlusion of the vascular bed of the tumors leads to a considerable reduction in intraoperative blood loss and to simplification of the surgical preparation.	2.696662681800018
By using Ethibloc for embolization, palliation of a hemorrhage or of tumor-related pain in inoperable patients is usually successful.	2.049912522732072
Although local control of the tumor disease, including complete tumor ablation, is achieved by embolization, the median survival rate of our palliatively embolized patients is only 3.5 months.	2.3908160618458236
This short life expectancy in the group of inoperable patients has to be acknowledged individually in patients considered for palliative embolization who are free of symptoms related to the tumor.	2.4778226165847435
Purpose: To evaluate whether primary stenting is superior to balloon angioplasty (PTA) alone in the treatment of femoropopliteal obstructive disease.	2.2320311356855496
Content of this paper is the current state of the art of robots in surgery and the ongoing work on the field of surgical robotics at the Clinic for Maxillofacial Surgery at the Charité.	2.2320212548733953
Robots in surgery allows the surgeon to transform the accuracy of the imaging systems directly during the intervention and to plan an intervention beforehand.	2.1719776523785237
In this paper firstly the state of the art is described.	2.2345596938194117
Subsequently the scientific work at the clinic is described in detail.	2.242713794667006
The paper closes with a outlook for future applications of robotics systems in maxillofacial surgery.	1.9007212479837978
Giant-cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern, frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given, and may potentially metastasize.	1.9924457126837274
By virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta-articular localization, giant-cell bone tumors require specific surgical management.	1.9273528214409057
Thus, an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone cementing, possibly combined with instillation of phenol or cryotherapy.	1.7510549730907174
These combined treatment modalities assure a high-quality procedure, defined as the actual way medical care is delivered, by promoting the quality of the outcome, defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient's state of health.	2.4386407850099077
We report two patients with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 7 and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 17.	2.1422385094019063
Chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 17 in the parents and other relatives.	2.200331956105491
Pedigree analysis reveals abortions, frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths.	2.070457584960509
Our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms: prominent forehead, hydrocephalus internus with wide cranial sutures and fontanels, hypertelorism, cleft soft palate, low set dysmorphic ears, psychomotor retardation and micrognathie.	1.671224895641853
Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are endowed with impressive metastatic potential.	2.207626169063026
Patients with RCC who present with apparently solitary metastatic lesions represent a small cohort.	1.9996259132441998
Due to the different long-term results achieved with surgical resection of metastatic RCC lesions, a generally accepted judgement about this treatment modality is not possible.	2.3201984158152884
Several studies suggest that aggressive surgical management can provide an effective treatment, especially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases.	2.747344299808125
Most noteworthy is the fact that because of the organ distribution of RCC metastases, surgical therapy is dominated by general and thoracic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and orthopaedic surgeons.	2.1917497619215403
Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is one of the most important key points for a successful outcome in these patients.	2.4709289517368456
The term Langerhans cell histiocytosis, previously "Histiocytosis X", encompasses three different syndromes: eosinophilic granuloma of bone, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Abt-Letterer Siwe disease.	1.6594156964823767
All are rare manifestations in childhood.	2.5174482520684665
We report on a 10 year old boy presenting with a swelling in the occipital region and clinical signs of elevated intracranial pressure.	2.1862650673261683
The tentative diagnosis after examination, conventional radiologic procedures and computerized tomography was eosinophilic granuloma.	1.9728548833949249
Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging-angiography revealed the acute threat to the child caused by the intracranial expanding mass lesion with almost complete obstruction of the confluens sinuum.	2.1857681018027573
After two years follow-up, no new lesions had appeared.	2.64617678834653
The diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen is a rare splenic proliferation.	2.549472310097428
Spontaneous rupture is the main, potentially lethal complication, found in 25 % of cases.	2.3392679719330727
The problem with these vascular tumors is preoperative diagnosis, because they are asymptomatic for a long time.	2.1033191656305905
First-choice therapy is limited resection.	2.5574640037307645
In the case of rupture, splenectomy is a life-saving procedure.	2.406419707775614
We report on a 56-year-old woman with a spontaneous splenic rupture as the first symptom of diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen.	1.9901676325530884
Exceptional features of splenic hemangiomas, causes of spontaneous rupture and the therapy are described.	2.1013811166417478
The hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a T cell mediated disease has led to the development of numerous therapeutic approaches that target the function of T cells.	2.389951430964078
The development of monoclonal antibodies against the T cell surface molecule CD4 has raised hopes to achieve a major progress in the treatment of RA.	2.3612547137098114
However, after encouraging results in early open studies, double blind trials were unable to demonstrate the efficacy of anti-CD4-therapy in RA.	2.2536075200674617
There are numerous reasons to explain the failure of this treatment approach.	2.3085201813226464
Besides the fact that the T cell hypothesis of RA has  repeatedly been challenged, pharmacological problems or an inappropriate selection of outcome criteria have to be considered.	2.002603654210654
The final evaluation of anti-CD4 therapy  in RA will be possible only after  the testing of newly developed  non-depleting anti-CD4 anti- bodies.	1.9786049588174999
Purpose: For some time, the ambulatory diagnosis of respiratory disturbances during sleep has included the use of seven-channel recording units.	2.224239182330642
One of these systems is the POLY-MESAM unit (MAP, Germany).	2.0483384548355343
Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers of information across the cell membrane by coupling receptors to effectors.	1.8578366441983443
A large number of G protein-linked receptors funnel extra-cellular signals as diverse as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and primary sensory stimuli through a set of G proteins to a small number of second-messenger systems.	1.8847330498422816
The G proteins act as molecular switches with an "on" and "off" state governed by a GTPase cycle.	1.9168178103517906
By virtue of its high affinity and specificity for guanine nucleotide binding and its intrinsic GTPase activity, the -subunit of the G protein (G) plays the critical role in regulation of the effectors by their corresponding G protein.	1.7976971437970326
Mutations of G may result in either constitutive activation or loss of expression mutations.	2.199800620076804
Given the variety of functions subserved by G protein-coupled signal transduction, it is not surprising that abnormalities in G protein-coupled pathways can lead to diseases with manifestations as dissimilar as blindness, hormone resistance, precocious puberty and neoplasia.	1.9195437961570494
For a given defect in a G protein-coupled pathway, the extent of the manifestations will also be determined by the cellular distribution of the affected component.	2.3587292870383894
Defects in components expressed exclusively in a single cell type will cause more a focal disorder than defects in a widely expressed component, particularly in germline mutations (e.g., Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy), whereas somatic mutations of genes encoding even an ubiquitously expressed component can cause focal disease when the somatic mutation itself is focal (e.g., McCune-Albright syndrome).	1.7698542249734686
After 2.5 times the ED95 (0.2 mg/kg), tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2-3 min following injection.	2.2259230727797243
The ensuing DUR 25% (i.e., time from injection to 25% recovery of control twitch tension) is three times as long as with succinylcholine.	1.9999120537010169
The principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to moderate histamine release following doses 3-4 times the ED95.	2.058461588041294
In patients with end-stage liver or renal disease as well as those with atypical plasma cholinesterase, the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged.	2.4064595448764923
The performance of new cryoprobes was studied by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of the temperature distribution in liver tissue around one to three active cryoprobes.	2.017064777352645
After 15 min of maximal freezing a tissue region 22 mm in diameter was frozen to temperatures below - 50  °C by one active cryoprobe.	1.8389862775213495
With three cryoprobes, using the synergistic cooling effect, a tissue region 45 mm in diameter was cooled to temperatures below - 50  °C.	1.9427620152703955
Optimal placement of the cryoprobes was found to be of critical importance.	2.923903417488914
Attachment representation was assessed in 48 elderly people with an average age of 69 years.	2.3351106952267435
The adult attachment interview was used plus an additional question about wishes for the future.	2.021669614098288
Coherent correlations with subjective life satisfaction and individual future perspective were demonstrated.	2.104395114802283
Elderly participants with secure attachment representation were more satisfied, they were also less anxious, and more often positive about their future.	2.0505926284336806
If their adult children had secure attachment representation, they were reported by their elderly parents to be socially, emotionally, and materially more supportive.	1.8455195374459081
Magnetic resonance imaging represents today the most important tool in neuroradiology for both clinical pratice and research.	2.196685403554281
MRI allows imaging of the human body in 2 or 3 dimensions with variable tissue contrast.	2.522997544136694
The natural diffusion of tissue protons can now be used as a supplementary contrast mechanism.	2.309782987939192
Different MRI techniques can be used to obtain clinically useful diffusion-weighted images.	2.4139409129305243
These techniques all require the use of strong gradient pulses in order to obtain the diffusion contrast.	2.580134484568428
In the current article, the most important physical principles of diffusion measurement are presented.	2.3757875520226617
After a short introduction into the basic physical principles, we will present the prerequisites and limitations of clinically relevant applications today.	2.1111853904228695
Finally a few select examples of clinical use of these techniques in the acute diagnosis of stroke will be presented.	2.578815144276905
The effects of chronical strains on physical or psychological health are subject of this paper.	2.076840919764092
Stress-related symptoms of family caregivers of dementia patients have been proven in various studies.	2.3045375151615217
For this group of people an analysis of the health risc factors is regarded as to be especially important.	2.6773782339843204
Diary investigations allow to identify the individual assessment (by the caring person) of factors related to the care situation and to recognize the health and quality of sleep have been used as indicators regarding the state of health.	2.2771728118868584
In this study strong differences in the individual view of stress factors and their effects on psychological an physical state of the caring person are shown.	2.148050791332609
The causes of residual deformity with posttraumatic painful arthritis after tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) fracture-dislocation with the need for correctional arthrodesis are in our experience (22 cases over 5 years) overseen injuries in one third, closed reduction and immobilisation or inadequate fixation technique with K-wires in another two thirds of cases.	1.7790510140518223
Foot malalignment and residual instability is assessed with weight-bearing radiographs of both feet, adduction/abduction stress films and CT scans for complex deformity.	1.9068951697615293
Correction is carried out via two longitudinal dorsal incisions, strict epiperiosteal preparation and debridement of the Lisfranc joint of all remaining cartilage, sclerosis and fibrous tissue.	1.8025267359411024
Reorientation begins, in the same manner as primary open reduction, with anatomical alignment of the second metatarsal base to the second cuneiform.	2.466934895258548
Defects are filled with autologous bone grafting, stable fusion can be achieved with 3.5 mm cancellous compression screws.	2.165246083258547
Full weight bearing is allowed in a modelled plaster shoe for 6 to 8 weeks.	2.0265234634537665
The functional medium-term results are convincing with 15 of 17 patients seen after 13 months of follow-up working full time.	2.455417527308927
The Maryland Foot Score improved from 38.9 to 76.8 points in these patients.	1.9834515396495727
The author of this paper deems it very necessary to rename Chinese Tuina, a traditional Chinese medical subject, so as to make Chinese Tuina conform to recent research results and formulation, as well as to combine Chinese Tuina with Western manual medicine at the clinic.	1.9067009990945945
This paper is the result of my research during the period of time was in Switzerland working together with Prof. Jiri Dvorak.	2.205234458548245
The operability of a liver tumour depends on its three-dimensional relation to the intrahepatic vascular trees which define autonomously functioning liver (sub-)segments.	2.015601727815448
The aim of our study was to establish a computer-based three-dimensional volumetric operation planning system for the liver.	2.287577584081506
Methods: Using data from routine helical CT scans the three tissue subclasses of liver parenchyma, liver vessels and liver tumour were segmented semiautomatically.	1.8454620258901815
A dedicated segmenting tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an "intelligent" border finder.	2.0933002214090273
Visualisation is performed by the "Heidelberg Raytracer".	2.7279610689657203
The vascular trees are visualised as 3D graphs.	2.162374831730819
Pseudoconnections between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically.	2.1455249429136654
Security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal.	2.139343898871317
Dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees.	2.5406296043145655
The system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour, security margin and dependent liver parenchyma.	1.9556206819073614
Conclusion: Three-dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology.	2.3222699613138045
This will make operation planning more objective; patient selection may be improved, and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested.	2.3019654734016815
Thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching, surgical training and planning.	2.0273265286415114
It may lead to improved surgical care.	2.9216233361599437
Methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing.	2.5169873212561296
P-wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting.	2.4864589322556223
However, correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p-wave analysis with the high resolution ECG.	2.095606208964282
Signal averaging triggered to the p-wave is significantly superior to QRS-triggering.	2.1066087438835885
Bidirectional filtering or FIR-filtering is necessary.	2.211170668756396
The data indicate significant differences in p-wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation.	2.337233892570126
Class I antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p-wave duration, but did not influence spectral parameters.	2.0407054725867106
Treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p-wave energy without altering p-wave duration.	2.0945486496422623
In addition, the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible.	2.7225287339555404
In the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit.	2.082202886132733
These may be fatal in patients treated conservatively with anticoagulation only.	2.544627965785783
In literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of 3 - 4%.	2.9325843960654976
Extremely mobile, long, worm-shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus-related mortality rate which ranges from 30 - 40%.	1.9700035487023622
Current therapeutic strategies favour fibrinolytic therapy with consecutive anticoagulation.	2.2764665255564305
In the last years, several studies addressed the role of the different antithrombotic therapeutics in unstable angina pectoris.	2.4890359223190766
Acetylsalicylic acid still is the standard treatment reducing the rate of death and myocardial infarction by 50% in the first six months.	2.6955698412691227
Ticlopidin has no clinical effect in the first six days and therefore is not suited for treatment in the acute phase.	2.647857425755467
Unfractionated heparin has an additional favourable effect when added to aspirin.	2.135287037301941
Low molecular weight-heparin is at least as effective as UF-heparin.	2.188724707391529
Direct thrombin-inhibitors (hirudin, hirudin-analoga) seem to be comparable to UF-heparin.	2.030977753823251
Pasminogen-activators should not be given in unstable angina, as they show a tendency to worsen the clinical outcome.	2.428971235766185
GP IIb/IIIa-antagonists (antibodies, synthetic antagonists) significantly improve the clinical effects of aspirin.	1.9994715882031933
When combined with a reduced dose of heparin, their favourable effect remains unchanged, while bleeding complications are reduced to a minimum.	2.1495230198209225
Cases have been ascertained retrospectively by reviewing hospital records of all children being referred to a children's hospital up to 2 years of age.	2.0145092761224337
The classification scheme was based on abnormalities in developmental mechanisms.	2.4123786791963524
Severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with oral involvement often leads to dental destruction and restricted food intake, resulting in malnutrition and maldevelopment.	1.9786174354334873
The patients become handicapped and have a poor prognosis.	2.253774267227781
We report on a now 13-year-old Turkish child with normal secondary dentition who had severely damaged primary dentition.	2.033537030589275
The teeth were treated surgically and then by continuous dental hygiene measures over the next 7 years.	2.1216866324586032
This care also resulted in an improvement in the nutritional state, associated anemia and the incidence of skin infections.	2.440610391119758
Although cutaneous blistering and scarring has been progressive, with resulting mutilation of the fingers, the child is socially well adjusted in school and family.	1.9270222214466572
Its clinical course demonstrates that the fate of patients with severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can be improved through multidisciplinary management.	2.478853752934262
Our understanding of ulcer pathogenesis has dramatically changed since the discovery of Heliobacter pylori.	2.0323370189581786
Peptic ulcer is now recognized as a chronic gastric infectious disease.	2.209415868576651
H. pylori can be considered the pacemaker, with other known risk factors ultimately contributing to the ulcer formation.	2.401049700829563
Treatment of H. pylori in peptic ulcer disease cures the acute lesion and prevents relapse and complications.	1.9429336339356804
In clinical management a positive diagnosis of H. pylori is required and other potential causes for ulcer formation must be excluded before starting treatment.	1.9885523031985852
The standard treatment in H. pylori positive ulcer consists of PPI in standard dose and two antibiotics either clarithromycin 2 x 500 mg and amoxycillin 2 x 1 g or metronidazole 2 x 400 mg and clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg (or 500 mg) for 7 days.	1.6887188995910383
The simultaneous presence of H. pylori and NSAID intake requires distinct management.	2.093010579167365
Following bleeding complication a PPI needs to be given beyond 7 days until ulcer healing is endoscopically confirmed.	2.029626436159586
We present the results of a study conducted in collaboration with the German workers' board to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in 477 cases.	2.524882627434718
The examiners reviewed the charts of patients who had suffered distorsion or luxation of the knee, fractures of the spine with or without neural deficits, calcaneus fractures, rotator cuff lesions and shoulder luxation, and fractures of the acetabulum and pelvis as the result of accidents.	2.508087408877289
A new documentation sheet was desiged to note administrative and medical data.	1.9988620447639331
All 477 patients' charts and X-rays were reviewed by three trauma surgeons, and procedures were monitored in a prospective manner.	2.187210410689063
The study revealed considerable discrepancies between the assumed injuries and those ultimately found to have been sustained, especially in the case of knee injuries.	2.3170334432991773
The article reveals the results concerning the validity of the diagnosis and the need for more precisely tailored diagnostic methods for different patient groups.	2.4158685831334505
Our final conclusion is that it is necessary to implement new paths of patient management and better steering features to improve both the quality of medical care and the administrative procedures in place.	2.2334807025057257
A workshop on attenuated cold-adapted influenza virus vaccines (CAIV) was organized in Langen, Germany on December 16-17, 1998 by Prof. Reinhard Kurth, President of the Paul Ehrlich Institute.	1.634510504085297
Reperfusion injury has become a scientific problem of increasing importance, in part because of recent developments of thrombolytic therapy.	2.2838671762265506
The mechanisms of reperfusion injury following focal cerebral ischemia, however, are not known in detail.	2.4365554957050017
Recent studies strongly suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium overload play an important role in reperfusion injury and that pharmacological interventions against calcium- or free radical-mediated damage could extend the therapeutic window in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.	1.8080347130172798
The mediators involved are known to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) during the reperfusion period, which is associated with uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a burst production of ROS, leading to cellular death.	2.2545638011772073
The mitochondrial PT is considered to be a key process in reperfusion injury following cerebral ischemia, as also observed in other organs such as heart and liver.	2.237810489374616
Pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial permeability changes have the potential to reduce tissue damage due to reperfusion.	2.181997292010792
We performed an open clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a 1 µg/h ganciclovir implant for the treatment of newly and pretreated cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).	2.294344601002234
The purpose of this study was to compare the initial stiffness of two techniques for posterior interbody lumbar fusion (PLIF) by a finite element approach.	1.8503668421838397
Thus a finite element model of a human L3/4 spinal segment was generated.	2.1753287453280654
Stiffness of the intact model was tested under compression (600 N), torsion (25 Nm) and shearing forces (250 N) without preload.	1.8682579857301054
The results were compared to the stiffness following simulation of PLIF with two BAK-Cages and PLIF with two Harms-Cages and additional posterior screw-rod-osteosynthesis.	1.8384595566532944
PLIF with two BAK-Cages resulted in a loss of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	2.0438497253110004
PLIF with two Harms-Cages and posterior osteosynthesis resulted in an increase of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	2.035977679134587
Tramadol, an analgesic with mean potency one tenth that of morphine is used regularely for the treatment of chronic and postoperative pain.	2.2389443084022123
Previous reports have indicated that tramadol may induce seizure activity when given together with a selective serotonine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).	1.9604377008115292
Therefore, its major mode of action may be questioned which purportedly is due to binding with the opioid receptor and partly due to the inhibition of monoamine reuptake.	2.168708687922266
Aim: The cause of a connatal hemiplegia was retrospectivly investigated in children born at term.	2.1329001334902964
The article gives a short review on the history of the field.	2.6019348413113117
First forensic cases were solved by the use  of medicocriminal entomology in the thirteenth century but the method has only developed to a professional level over the last 100 years.	2.118007483941005
In Europe, mainly French, Belgian, English and Scandinavian researchers have been responsible for maintaining the methods.	1.8442349915781417
In France, an entomological police laboratory has been set up in Rosny-sous-bois.	1.9097483548496652
In contrast to the United States of America where entomological evidence is accepted by the courts, the method has only just started to be accepted in Germany.	1.9546048654987733
Initially cooperation with the police and with judges might help to establish the analysis of arthropods as a routine tool in forensic science for Germany.	2.1736704580794233
27 patients with sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCC) and/or pustulotic arthroosteitis (PAO) were examined with whole body scintigraphy, conventional radiography, and other imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI.	2.4253370267720378
25 of 27 patients with SCCH showed a characteristic high bullhorn-like uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region with the manubrium sterni representing the skull and the inflamed sternocostoclavicular joints corresponding to the horns (=bullhorn-sign).	1.7544874637054062
Scintigraphy revealed additional skeletal manifestations (spondylitis, sacroiliitis, osteitis, periostitis) in 19 of the 27 patients with SCCH and/or PAO.	2.0935322084873222
In combination with PPP or psoriasis pustulosa, the typical scintigraphic bullhorn pattern enables the diagnosis of PAO (19 patients) with high confidence.	2.1634327895996877
Patients with SCCH but without skin disease at the time of presentation (8 of 27 patients) may develop PPP later and, therefore, it is justified to classify them as incomplete PAO with high risk to develop other skeletal manifestations later in the course of the disease.	2.117942734269931
PADAM stands for partial androgen deficiency in the aging male, and it is currently diagnosed with a testosterone level below 3 ng/ml (300 ng/dl or 12 nmol/l), and with symptoms varying according to the individual.	2.2648494775205394
The symptoms are a reduction or even loss of libido, a decline in muscle mass and strength, enhancement of visceral fatty tissue-padding, dryness of the skin, apathy, tiredness and distortion of mood right up to depression, and ostalgia due to osteoporosis.	1.8048617750360392
A 34 year-old pregnant woman presented with reticulate pigmentation of the flexures, the dorsum of the hands and the genitoperianal region.	2.113876792691375
She was in good health and her family history was unremarkable.	2.16499664792773
Histologic examination of the hyperpigmented patches revealed pigmented filiform downgrowths of the interfollicular epidermis and follicular infundibula, as well as small epithelial cysts.	2.17857903657634
Upon immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies, the number of melanocytes appeared normal.	2.6914693399602694
The elongated dendritic processes of the melanocytes contained many mature melanosomes.	2.0923140998785894
In the adjacent keratinocytes large melanosomes did not aggregate into complexes.	2.0052756326501497
The diagnosis of localized reticulate pigmentary disorder was established.	2.1677033976089004
The knowledge of the broad clinical spectrum of localized reticulate hyperpigmentations with its favorable prognosis is of practical importance.	2.074291826315238
Genital or flexural pigmented lesions have to be differentiated from melanosis of the vulva or acanthosis nigricans.	2.2604911401992265
The presented case gives further evidence that many of the proposed entities characterized clinically by reticulate pigmented macules and hyperkeratotic follicular lesions are different phenotypic expressions of the same autosomal dominant genodermatosis.	1.8117335528608387
Purpose: During the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life (QOL) data regarding surgical treatment.	2.2585677128844717
Methods: The present study comments the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery after required Nissen fundoplication of 70 patients.	2.37432697981143
Therefore, the German Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was used to query the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to 1 year.	2.0706832237157418
Results: Preoperatively, we found a low general GIQLI score (mean 92.7 points), which increased 6 weeks postoperatively (116.8 points), 3 months (124.8) and 1 year (mean 123.9 points) significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population (122.6 points).	2.070993246252655
Conclusion: It is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required Nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using QOL.	2.681920964094907
Introduction: Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign.	2.493169940121713
Results: Between October 1993 and December 1998, 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection; in 12 cases (11 women, 1 man) a serous cystadenoma (10 micrcocystic, 2 oligomacrocystic) was found.	2.0458699298759297
Only 6 (50 %) patients had symptoms.	2.5599383145109593
All tumors were resected: 4 Whipple procedures, 7 distal pancreatectomies and 1 segmental resection were performed.	1.9271305924761166
No patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on.	2.570348405788662
Conclusions: Because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas, we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected.	2.5320534009651503
We examined the prevalence of HIV-associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of UV-radiation in HIV-infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of 1310 patients seen between and 1994 and 1996.	2.2964375862582047
41 patients were treated with UVB-radiation and 4 patients with UVA1-radiation, while three patients received PUVA-therapy.	2.328277359881034
UV-radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	2.45979806308176
Although some in vitro studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested a negative impact of UV radiation on the immunosystem of HIV-positive patients, no progression of the HIV infection due to phototherapy has been proven.	1.975483390320216
The staff at interventional radiological procedures is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation.	2.218175748089642
This applies especially to measures at cardiac catheterization laboratories.	2.1630598146167443
In this study the annual radiation exposure to the staff was estimated by measuring the dose rate under characteristic conditions.	1.9598056335758403
It could be shown that the resulting radiation exposure was strongly dependent on the radiation protection measures and is also dependent on the operation conditions of the x-ray tube.	2.3694882512686535
The effective dose for the physician wearing a lead apron and thyroid shield was detremined to about 1.7 mSva.	1.8757902511736602
Without a thyroid shield an effective dose of about 3.5 mSva resulted.	2.1659870244089325
This corresponds to approximately the natural background radiation of about 2.4 mSva in the Federal Republic of Germany.	1.9656710331473768
From the number of procedures performed we could derive an effective dose of approximately 1-2 µSv per application for the physician, averaged over all types of procedures.	2.233292282297835
Further, it could be shown that the readings of the film badges, usually worn by the staff, underestimate the effective dose by approximately a factor of two.	1.9845278062678535
This is because the film badges do not include the contribution of the unshielded parts of the body to effective dose.	2.147177451216247
From the estimated annual effective dose, a lifetime dose of 68 mSv was estimated for a 40-year working career.	1.9078917165881615
The corresponding lifetime risk for induced fatal cancer due to radiation exposure was determined to 0.3% applying the ICRP risk factor of 4  -  10-2 Sv-1.	1.9359600861950101
Considering the NCRP recommendations for a safe occupation, working in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can be considered as safe when applying all radiation protection measures.	2.1014989354988702
However, changing the protection measures and modifying the parameters of the x-ray-tube can lead to strong changes of the radiation exposure and the resulting risk estimation.	2.398639434741402
Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is an important issue in intensive care.	2.8035568758995173
One therapeutic regimen involves the intravenous administration of prostacyclin (PGI2).	2.056816361276856
Thus, its clinical usefulness is limited.	2.447320398298273
However, the inhalation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) or nebulized PGI2 causes a selective pulmonary vasodilation in ventilated alveoli and improved gas exchange, without any systemic vasodilation.	1.7718612012037147
It has therefore gained importance for the treatment of pulmonary failure associated with high shunt fractions.	2.6865141454874624
However, the inhalation of vasodilators may have adverse effects: in the case of NO, toxic side effects are predominant (MetHb, NOx), whereas in the case of PGI2, technical problems in terms of dosing and administration safety are of major interest.	2.2382493468926463
Furthermore, some patients do not respond to the treatment.	2.5906652251131597
The exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated.	2.439806929074025
The treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms by means of transluminally placed endovascular prostheses reflects significant progress in the field of vascular surgery.	2.278595365449931
In the case of infrarenal aortic aneurysm it is possible to achieve technically successful implantation of such a prosthesis in well over 90 % of cases.	2.251764941203841
The rate of clinical success, meaning lasting effective exclusion of the aortic aneurysm, cannot (yet) be definitively determined, since no long-term results are so far available.	2.1010989449940674
Secondary leaks are observed in at least 10 % of all patients, making a further therapy necessary (endorepair, conversion, embolization).	2.3423134093433586
Further development of endovascular prostheses will include optimization of the aortal/iliac attachment of the prostheses, a better configuration and the development of long-lasting materials that can be used for endovascular prostheses.	2.4882773962635008
The frequency of postspinal headaches after accidental puncture of the subarachnoid space with 16 - 18 G Tuohy needles is reported at 59 - 85%.	1.7744541878319806
A case of postspinal headache syndrome persisting over a period of 6 weeks following epidural anaesthesia during labour is described.	2.043038904706215
A 30-year-old women had severe postspinal headache for 6 weeks after epidural anaesthesia during labour.	2.4008119729071833
Conservative therapy for 3 days and 4 days of bedrest followed by cristalloid infusions during a 3-week hospital stay and a subsequent 3-week period of bedrest at home did not lead to lasting pain relief.	2.0375104550757914
Intracranial haematoma and other abnormal processes were excluded by CCT.	2.212066891925643
A pathologic EEG was not confirmed by cranial MRT.	2.218352747434945
A lumbar epidural blood patch of 15 ml of autologous blood was performed at L3/4.	2.412566852803102
The patient stayed in bed for 12 h. After 3 h free of pain the patient complained of recurring headache.	2.0301846859551738
After a further 48 h of bedrest she had recovered.	2.1825008954752434
Because of lumbar pain 4 days after the epidural blood patch a MRT was performed, which showed the blood at L4 to S3 in the epidural space.	2.2171150542547555
The diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage was based on the history and the main symptom of postspinal headache: the pain onset in the supine position.	2.399339342893243
Such possible treatments as diminishing subarachnoidal pressure by bedrest, increasing cerebrospinal fluid production by infusions, increasing epidural pressure by epidural infusions and closing the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by epidural blood patch are discussed.	1.7644038219526392
The average success rate with the epidural blood patch is 93%.	2.283581523164147
Volumes ranging from 5 to 20 ml are discussed for the autologous blood.	2.2160376515059963
We chose 15 ml of blood, to take account of the possibility that blood might settle in the wide sacral space.	2.1566086905840502
We were able to document the position of the blood patch as L4 to S3 on MR tomography (the injection site was L3/4).	2.1790907053697555
Most patients are free of headache 1 h after epidural blood patch.	2.313425254131986
Our patient had to be confined to bed for another 48 h because of recurring headache.	2.3280898031665
The blood patch alone was not immediately sufficient to prevent all further cerebrospinal fluid leakage.	2.080441975275484
Probably more than one subarachnoidal puncture had been made during the difficult epidural anesthetic procedure.	2.2248479075429044
On the other hand, the leak was probably only diminished because of the blood patch descending down to the wide sacral space.	2.108950900493166
The combination of the large-volume blood patch, which diminished the leakage, and conservative treatment, which narrowed the transdural pressure difference, was successful: the 6-week postspinal headache was cured.	1.9226287303051257
Prolonged postspinal headache should be treated by epidural blood patch.	2.6181782623289696
The use of over 10 ml cannot be generally recommended, although in this case most of the blood patch of 15 ml was localized caudally.	2.2882487145480837
Careful monitoring for side effects is necessary with blood volumes larger than 10 ml.	2.142612178488254
If the headache persists a second blood patch should be performed, with the volume and the probable caudal spreading of the first taken into account.	2.45526207373969
The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability (HRV) and on left ventricular function in 14 patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).	2.182122574793991
After a 3- to 4-week titration period, carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily, or the highest dose tolerated (at least 25mg daily).	1.9976328628869546
Maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks.	2.5196575864026545
Digital 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy.	2.243246858931778
HRV for the entire 24-hour period was computed in the time domain using the Oxford Medilog Excel 2 analysis system.	2.0609719755730813
Measures of HRV included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), and the proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing >50ms (pNN50).	2.1509453899790336
The histologic determination of the degree of tissue anaplasia and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features (nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses, endothelial proliferation, tumor necrosis).	2.0167480064075423
This grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist, especially concerning the weighting of criteria (scant, moderate, pronounced).	2.0519580301872433
An observer-independent approach seems to be feasible by abandoning the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an binary approach noting only the presence or absence of these structure parameters.	2.0710793594586727
This grading procedure is recognized in the revised WHO classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas (Ste.	1.9999265014032404
Anne-Mayo System, SAMS).	2.2620642347586557
Our results indicate that a similiar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas.	1.9813225558664644
Our recent investigations on glioma grading showed, both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, that a two-tiered grading scheme distinguishing only "low-grade" and "high-grade" cases was prognostically relevant.	2.0530167393580516
For all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in CT and MRI seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the "high" malignancy grade.	2.308755460196259
In patients with severe angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, who are not candidates for either percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) often leads to improvement of clinical symptoms and increased exercise capacity.	2.1260403482745174
One drawback of TMR is the need for surgical thoracotomy in order to gain access to the epicardial survace of the heart.	2.446424217875682
Therefore, a catheter-based system has been developed, which allows creation of laser channels into the myocardium from the left ventricular cavity.	2.253758807922395
Several phase III studies have proven that the beta-interferons have positive effects on the number and severity of acute exacerbations of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.	2.0784517343268814
Recently the first study on the effectiveness of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was published.	2.4093502563154687
In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 718 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) value between 3.0 and 6.5 were treated with either 8 Mio.	1.9559719332941095
interferon beta-1b or placebo subcutaneously every second day for two to three years.	2.094710508541935
The primary study end-point was the time until confirmed progression of the disease as signified by a one point increase of the EDSS value (for initial EDSS values between 3.0 and 5.5) or 0.5 point increase when the initial EDSS value was between 6.0 and 6.5.	1.8850844981016752
After two years an interim analysis showed a highly significant difference in delay of disease progression by nine to twelve months for the treatment group (p=0.0008).	2.1393738851397344
This means that interferon beta-1b is the first recombinant beta-interferon to be shown effective in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.	2.352276167193698
To test the effect of dorzolamide on accommodation or pupillary function.	2.357432569109315
As a result of projection and counter transference the therapist developes feelings of distrust, disbelief and of being involved in a "hysterical theatre performance" so that this sort of therapy is very difficult to conceive and carry out.	1.8032502500128516
In this contribution an attempt is being made to understand these patients and to examine their psychodynamic background as well as the deeper meaning of their above mentioned theatrical efforts.	2.1169402036048846
On the basis of these cases we can put the following psychodynamic hypotheses: 1) The incest-phantasy is a narcissistic attempt; 2) The incest-phantasy is a symbolic representation; 3) in the sense of a symbolic wish-fullfillment included in the parent-child-interaction.	1.8815418672403128
After this, an attempt is being made to examine in various therapeutical scenes the role of these phantasis during the transference procedings and finally to develope diagnostic criteria with which these patients can be differentiated from others with definitely witnessed sexual abuse cases so that consequently treatment techniques can be devised in future.	1.84374566837998
Hospitals and clinics for ambulant surgery shall identify and register certain officially defined nosocomial infections (Surveillance) as well as the isolation of bacteria with special and important antimicrobial resistancies (§ 23 Abs.	1.8956260372633096
1 IfSG = Infection Prevention Act).	2.307219351314572
The nosocomial infections to be recorded, i. e device associated infections and postsurgical woundinfections, have been selected on the basis of national and international experiences with the surveillance of nosocomial infections.	2.238260287812121
Important antimicrobial resistancies have been determined according to both the prevalence of the bacteria in nosocomial settings as well as their clinical and epidemiological importance.	2.4342684209225345
Most of the relevant data may be provided by the clinical microbiology laboratory but shall be collected, listed and discussed by the staff of wards or surgery clinics.	1.8838050436828173
Both types of documentation shall be used to identify and eradicate problems in hygiene management and to stop further distribution of difficult to treat bacteria like MRSA.They are part of the quality assurance management according to § 137 SGB V.	2.081535067451594
Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world, e. g., south-east Asia, while they occur infrequently in western  Europe.	2.1445095961676066
The association of NPCs with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a transforming human herpes virus, is well established.	2.036906824150201
The current WHO classification recognises two major NPC histotypes, non-keratinising NPC and squamous cell NPC.	2.069211763709882
EBV is invariably present in non-keratinising NPCs and the viral oncoprotein LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1) is expressed in some cases.	2.376469619873742
The tumour cells of non-keratinising NPCs show phenotypic features which are inducible by LMP-1 in  vitro.	2.1008370719778533
Furthermore, the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ.	2.047447126041339
Thus, the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of  non-keratinising NPCs.	2.876778197688667
By contrast, the association of squamous cell NPCs with EBV  displays a geographical variability.	2.3116392650196325
It appears, therefore, that squamous cell NPCs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non-keratinising NPCs.	2.1286516541403784
To assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors following postoperative external radiotherapy in 77 patients with low-grade glioma.	2.1669597003673475
Between 1977 and 1996, 45 patients with astrocytoma, 14 with oligodendroglioma and 18 with mixed glioma received postoperative radiotherapy with a median total dose of 52 Gy (range, 45 to 61 Gy).	1.9916912729509242
The influence of various factors including histology, gender, age, seizures, duration of symptoms (<= 6 weeks vs > 6 weeks), CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement), type of surgery, total radiotherapy dose and timing of radiotherapy on relapse-free survival and overall survival was investigated.	1.9883435322617937
The median overall survival time was 81 month, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 54% and 31%, respectively.	2.274600319244776
The median time to progression was 56 months, while the 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates were 45% and 24%.	2.20425334248047
Univariate analyses identified the total radiotherapy dose (p = 0.01), duration of symptoms (p = 0.05), the presence of seizures (p = 0.04), and the CT pattern following intravenous contrast (p = 0.005) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival.	2.6089817562486344
Progression-free survival rates were influenced by the total dose (p = 0.04), the duration of symptoms (p = 0.01) and CT pattern (p = 0.006).	2.7503575228298347
On multivariate analysis, only the CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement) remained as independent prognostic factors for both progression-free survival and overall survival.	2.0243882676801204
A minimum total dose of 52 Gy is recommended for the postoperative radiotherapy in low-grade glioma.	2.5097527092885845
Tumors with CT enhancement seem to need further intensification of treatment.	2.0903181734912173
We report three patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).	2.3718965106952443
On clinical examination, no sensory deficit was elicited.	2.470722247435622
Electromyography (EMG) and motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies were indicative of an axonal lesion.	1.9126215442184344
Sensory NCV and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal.	2.1118346924781815
Sural nerve biopsy revealed unequivocal alterations of sensory nerve fibers, some in the form of primary demyelination.	2.0928389057304617
Therefore, these cases must bei classified as combined motor-sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings.	2.1010246465098907
Although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred, causing tetraparalysis, this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant.	2.107187932287582
In contrast to positive reports in literature, immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases.	2.104176276704286
Continuous spinal anaesthesia (CSA) is a further means of central nerve block for anaesthesia besides single-shot spinal (SSS), combined spinal/epidural, and epidural anaesthesia.	1.943634128762429
Do hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected food handlers represent a risk for the consumer?	2.438787744432945
Epidemiological data on HCV transmission  in our opinion do not provide a basis for excluding HCV positive individuals from working as food handlers in general.	1.993254784978836
Such restrictions seem to be justified only if HCV infected employees might infect their colleagues while performing occupational activities that are associated with a high risk of contracting percutaneous injuries and overt bleeding.	2.1226959549195032
Recently, good functional and anatomical results have been reported in treating full thickness macular holes.	2.3649944733868633
Only a few studies describe a removal of a membrane at the vitreoretinal interface after having removal of the vitreous and its cortex.	2.1236919218973376
To demonstrate the beneficial effects of removing this membrane at the vitreoretinal interface we present our functional and anatomical results in this retrospective study.	2.181254043089016
Dementia-screening in clinical routine requires short, sensitive and specific tools.	2.276611902631497
A number of standardized instruments are available for this purpose.	2.4729259491892686
The present study analysed the relationship between size of three examplary dementia-screening tests and their diagnostic accuracy.	2.055932508466772
A phlebological report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology.	2.242568594032723
The most important, reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic phlebodynamometry and ascending pressure phlebography, as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made.	2.016059327098198
Additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour- coded duplex sonography.	2.281967612750808
A thrombophilic condition should always be investigated in terms of haemotasis.	2.6514159385195835
In patients with severe post-thrombotic disease, a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with, and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and, if possible, dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination.	2.3289841297635623
There is currently no generally valid schematization of the post-thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion.	1.9660690756952064
When evaluating patients, we largely follow our own new classification, which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis.	1.9993301005373767
Since systemic treatment of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetics (DNPU) has so far been rather ineffective, recent reports of successful management of DNPU by short-term retrograde transvenous leg perfusions (RVP) by South American angiologists encouraged us to apply this treatment method in diabetics suffering from chronic DNPU.	1.746715253009449
Hence, in a prospective comparative clinical trial started in 1989 we have treated 45 male diabetics suffering from DNPU with the same daily doses of netilmycin, administered either in systemic venous infusions (SVI: n=21, three times/day) or in RVP (n=24, once/day).	1.9620095072268549
After 10 consecutive days of treatment, ulcers had closed in 8 of the 24 patients treated with RVP, as against 3 of the 21 treated with SVI.	2.1583967784393874
Diminution of the ulcer area by >30% including full debridement was achieved in 10/24 of the RVP cases (SVI: 4/21).	2.0229137936509254
During 6 months of follow-up, amputation of toes or forefoot was necessary in only 1 patient in the RVP group, but in 4 in the SVI group.	2.3826378299952173
Partial restitution of osteolytic damage was observed in some cases after RVP.	2.63981161483975
Our results show that regional netilmycin therapy given by the RVP procedure is clearly superior to equal netilmycin doses administered by SVI for the treatment of DNPU.	2.0747103618267615
RVP can be recommended in DNPU, particularly when the ulcers are complicated by infections.	2.358710865690395
There is hardly any other discipline that illustrates the conflict between the freedom of science and research, that is to say, ultimately, what is medically possible, and human dignity and the protection of life or, in other words, what can be justified in ethical or legal terms, so clearly as reproduction medicine.	1.7819010385956164
The topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum, ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective feticide, the many questions raised by assisted fertilization, and especially by anonymous sperm donation, and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation, to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis, some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts.	1.9622703171667701
In a good many of these sectors it is difficult to reconcile what doctors can do and what it is admissible for them to do, so that it is hardly surprising that there is often no general consensus.	1.9620684987438008
Against this backdrop objective discussion is all the more important, and the notes in this paper, which necessarily touch on only some of the matters at issue, are intended to stimulate such discussion.	2.1553590241885936
In MR-imaging, similar to computed tomography, diagnosis of metastatic lymph-node disease is based on lymph-node sizes, and thereby it is non-specific.	2.5116384857991956
Superparamagnetic iron oxide as a potential contrast medium for MR-lymphography accumulate in normal lymph node tissue after endolymphatic, interstitial and, in case of very small particles, after intravenous injection.	2.048899988452855
Lymph-node metastases can be detected by all three injection techniques.	2.514131338147796
It has been shown experimentally, that in particular small metastases can be detected in normal sized lymph nodes.	2.354986954943095
However, MR-lymphography also has inherent methodologic problems, as there may occure an uneven distribution of the contrast medium between different lymph-node groups.	2.1430396287496736
The experimental results with endolymphatic, interstitial, and intravenous MR-lymphography as well as first clinical results with intravenous contrast medium injection are presented and discussed.	2.254250896399466
The purpose of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional results of vitreoretinal silicone oil surgery for complicated retinal detachments due to trauma and myopia in children and juveniles.	1.948309035545083
In 1993, we adopted conventional thoracic and abdominal prosthetic grafting and tailored aortoplasty (TAP) of the thoraco-abdominal aortic segment III/IV in chronic-expanding type B aortic dissection (CEAD) to achieve 2 primary goals: 1. reduction of renal/visceral and spinal cord ischemic time; 2. safe and secure reperfusion of all critical aortic branches for prevention of major complications, i. e. paraplegia, kidney failure, and intestinal infarction.	1.7987421577004512
Among 71 thoracoabdominal aortic reconstructions since 1993, 5 CEAD patients (median age 47.8 yr, mean CEAD- 6.5 cm, 4 with Marfan Syndrome) underwent TAP.	1.8323456215817555
Selection criteria are: 1.	2.749181345732882
CEAD- >5 cm 2. expansion rate >=5 mm/6 months 3. involvement of the critical aortic segment III/IV.	2.075527891195414
TAP consists of: 1. left posterolateral aortotomy from Th 8 - L 2, 2. excision of the intraaortic dissection membrane(s) 3. aortic closure to a diameter of 3 cm to reduce wall tension.	1.9125924003067543
All 5 patients survived without any major complications, particularly no paraplegia.	2.2999950848201958
Mean cross-clamping was 43 min.	2.434235582184072
After 7 months, 1 patient was successfully repaired due to false aneurysm at the distal thoracic graft suture line.	2.0576852053912087
After mean follow-up of 2.4 years, CT-angiography revealed a stable TAP segment (mean aortic- 3.2 cm) in 4 patients and one re-expanded TAP segment (from 4 cm after 24 months up to 7 cm) without signs of re-dissection.	2.024374012459281
Our 4-year-results (1) corroborate the Johns Hopkins data.	2.920783336050541
Although one re-expanded TAP segment is disquieting, we found the short-term gains so rewarding to strongly advocate the tailored approach as a principle means of avoiding paraplegia in this extremely high risk group of patients.	1.8968263432038868
All optically active molecules have at least one asymmetric atom in common which is attached to four ligands, that can have different three dimensional positions.	1.9448388044404392
Therefore it can be concluded that the resulting isomers are chemically identical in all respects except for the direction with which they rotate plane-polarized light.	2.008054751850455
When the isomer and its corresponding enantiomer are present in equal proportions, they are called racemic mixture, a mixture that does not rotate polarized light, since the optical activities of the two isomers cancel each other.	1.9279207243402854
Although the isomers are chemically identical other optically active molecules can interact with these isomers in a geometrically specific way termed stereoselectivity.	1.806066017824253
The human body comprises a chiral environment due to optically active proteins; thus it is not surprising that enantiomeric drugs exhibit different pharmacological properties, when used as pure optical isomers.	1.8921284813684849
Till today most modern anaesthetics have been optical isomers, which are mainly used as racemic mixture (1:1 mixture).	2.065819724472246
For financial reasons pure isomers were only used for research purposes, but nowadays the wide clinical use of pure isomers is financially feasible due to new production techniques.	1.9088990406823048
The terms eutomer and distomer were chosen to indicate the more or less potent form of the drug.	2.257897892626341
Among the modern anaesthetics ketamine, isoflurane, bupivacaine and atracurium exhibit an asymmetric carbon.	1.9281741444300395
For most drugs the separation in pure isomers will reduce side effects.	2.0354248877883934
For volatile anaesthetics this question is still unanswered, since experimental and clinical results are inconsistent so far.	2.1313775789253846
The high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in asthmatics and patients with nasal polyps as well as reports of familial clustering suggest a genetic disposition of this disease.	2.3161337788010035
Our study aimed at obtaining further evidence of hereditary factors in this disease.	2.144944620895676
We included 33 unselected patients from 28 families with aspirin intolerance and rhinosinusitis in this study.	1.9868573954795308
Controls were recruited from individuals treated in our ENT clinic for diseases other than aspirin intolerance (n=52).	1.9921080851989876
The application of a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture (tryptophan depletion test) induces a rapid and substantial lowering of both total and free plasma tryptophan.	1.9217325805564476
Consequently, the brain serotonin content and also cerebral serotonin function are decreased.	2.068589339113364
This method provides a paradigm to study the role of serotonin in the pathobiology of depressive disorders and their treatment modalities.	2.1946225875964793
Untreated depressed patients show few behavioral effects during tryptophan depletion.	2.1310976841840867
In depressed patients during an antidepressant or light-therapy-induced stable remission, a transient depressive relapse was induced by tryptophan depletion.	1.9453961119779308
Healthy subjects with a genetic risk for affective disorder show worsening of their condition induced by tryptophan depletion.	2.023375497174333
These findings indicate the relevance of altered brain serotonin function in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and strengthen the importance of serotonin in the mechanism of action of antidepressants.	2.2997485454546305
Since recently published studies revealed some evidence that the serotonergic system is directly involved in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric syndromes besides depression, it seems to be reasonable to evaluate the validity of the tryptophan depletion test also in non-depressed patients.	2.312445084421006
Several common chronic pain syndromes come to the attention of the rheumatologist demanding for differentiation from fibromyalgia (FM), although they are often associated with it.	2.0048616264245034
They may mimick FM by (1) the occurance of wide spread pain, (2) the chronicity of complaints, (3) the preponderance of females in some of these, and (4) the lack of objective data to be derived from imaging techniques and laboratory tests.	2.2547032650594687
Pain is produced by the disturbance of normal function ("dysfunctional syndromes", MASI, ref.	2.1620083939620933
Recognition requires examination of the locomotor system under biomechanical auspices both at rest and during movement in order to diagnose hyper- and hypomobility syndromes; treatment of these conditions is guided by principles to improve biomechanical function.	2.1739345194306585
In addition, the skin needs to be examined to detect panniculosis (also called "cellulitis"), which may be mixed up with FM due to its preferential occurance in peri- or postmenopausal women.	2.106868028533424
It is concluded that the aforementioned differential diagnosis needs to be considered appropriately in coinciding FM and all studies dealing with FM.	2.086515805324101
In a prospective, randomized study of patients with acute manifestation of coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol >=130<=250mg/dl), we compared the effect of an early-initiated, intensified therapy to usual care antilipidemic therapy with respect to coronary lesions and clinical events.	2.3715381704849423
Patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and/or PTCA because of severe/instable angina pectoris.	2.412536450541262
In the control group, antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician.	2.314890918692795
Multiple sclerosis is a rare disease in childhood.	2.8875188700530092
A 10 1/2 year old girl developed a rapidly ongoing paresis of the right leg accompanied by paresthesia, sphincter incompetence and retrobulbar neuritis.	2.1485706303041123
Abrupt vessel closure of the dilated vessel continues to represent a significant limitation of coronary angioplasty.	2.2716476392349274
Despite increasing operator experience and improved technology, abrupt vessel closure continues to represent the most important complication of balloon angioplasty.	2.351521013723956
Intracoronary stent implantation and pharmaceutical blockade of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor serve as effective tools in the prevention of abrupt vessel closure without completely resolving this problem.	2.0095431813503453
About 50% of patients presenting with abrupt vessel closure exhibit additional complications including myocardial infarction, necessity of CABG or death occurring in up to 10% of acute occlusions.	2.210179501620466
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if quantitative coronary angiography and assessment of clinical and laboratory data allows risk stratification concerning the probability of abrupt vessel closure.	2.2877162210084867
PTCA in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of abrupt vessel closure, indicating that different risk factors may contribute to the development of abrupt vessel closure in patients presenting with stable angina or acute coronary insufficiency syndromes.	2.5413906309083827
Since the skin dose becomes the limiting factor while deciding the tumorcidal dose, the detailed analysis of dose distribution in the build-up region is necessary for high-energy photon beams.	1.9245959989320571
In this study the beam characteriwstics affecting the build-up and skin dose for 6- and 18-MV photons are analyzed.	1.9616915448143137
Measurements were made with 6- and 18-MV photons using a PTW parallel-plate ionization chamber (B23344-036) and a RDM-1F electrometer.	1.9057046108558742
Build-up ionization measurements were made with the chamber fitted into a 25 x 25 x 25 cm polystyrene phantom with a fixed SSD of 100 cm.	1.8736158096955808
Exit dose measurements were carried out for the graphite patient supporting assembly table top, 1.0 cm thick piece of wood and the 1.0 cm thick patient supporting perspex base frame for head and neck treatments.	1.9010809585631703
It was observed that the dmax decreased slightly with field size as with other accelerators.	2.044290269471004
For both photon energies the surface dose was observed to increase with increase in field size.	2.1023760787175694
It was also noticed that the dose in the build-up region increases slightly when the polycarbonate secondary blocking tray is introduced with the increase in surface dose.	1.9257673303460174
The data show that the tray pertubation factor (TPF) at surface decreases steadily with tray-surface distance for both photon beams for all field sizes.	1.8430746238427524
It was noted that the TPF was more when the polycarbonate tray was introduced at shorter tray-surface distances for both energies.	1.8696071091907507
At tray-surface distances above 60 cm the TPF almost remained close to unity for 6-MV photons for all field sizes, whereas the continuous decrease in TPF could be noted for 18-MV photon beams even after the TPF rewached unity.	1.8507333382290987
The use of wedge filters absorbs low-energy scattered electrons siginificantly and hence, the relative surface dose (RSD) is always less than unity.	1.7913727830096458
The increase in dose enhancement percentage with graphite compared to perspex supporting assembly indicates that the electron backscatter is proportional to the atomic number of the medium.	1.8204271908662022
We investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet (diet I) adapted to nutritional habits in Germany.	2.0616511013513916
Data were compared to a low fat diet (diet II) according to the American Heart Association.	2.519686228325186
Daily fat intake was 38g (24% of energy intake of 6.5MJ/d) in diet I and 60g (31% of 7.3MJ/d) in diet II (p<0.01), respectively.	1.8403997682522266
When compared with dietII, in dietI the intake of cholesterol, saturated and monunsaturated fatty acids, Vit.	1.8278874095970952
B12 were all reduced (p<0.01), whereas the uptake of Vit.	2.781742598583883
C was increased p<0.01.	2.6873451444083605
The intake of folic acid was low in both groups.	2.2218364011512834
Both diets resulted in a decrease in BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels.	2.4024578917443735
Concomitantly plasma triglycerides only decreased in response to dietI but HDL cholesterol levels remained unchanged.	2.0222394921734503
Reduction of BMI and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline BMI and cholesterol concentrations, respectively.	1.9972085611398056
The cholesterol lowering effect of diet I is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet.	2.243916894829105
Taking into account the nutritional habits in Germany, very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value.	2.4210265335130656
Both diets are effective in lowering body weight, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels without affecting HDL cholesterol.	1.9656110825227524
These effects are most pronounced in overweight and hypercholesterolemic patients.	2.1627546724170217
Besides autopsy determined findings of a fibro-fatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium, no assured clinical evidence of arrhythmogenie right ventricular dysplasia-cardiomyopathy (ARVD) exists yet.	1.9367973004598997
These criteria include structural, functional, histological, and electrophysiological abnormalities, which were divided into major and minor criteria.	2.2288058520672798
With the successive examination of a collective of 24 patients with a histologically determined diagnosis of ARVD at the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seien, France, the value of the complied criteria were checked.	2.033606092530675
Global or segmental dilatation of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be proven in 20 patients (83%) using angiography or electrocardiography.	2.394638079745077
Four patients (16%) exhibited only minor criteria in the radionuclear angioscintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disturbances of the right ventricular.	2.23889552232215
In all patients, the typical fibrofatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium could be histologically determined.	2.460831774362027
T-inversion in the right precordial leads were present in 17 patients (71%).	2.5153075360765875
A localized QRS-widening of more than 110ms in V1 to V3 in 8 patients (33%) and an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) were observed as major criteria.	2.1638830320648705
A late potential analysis using signal averaged ECG was only present in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of minor criteria.	2.421959110783661
Left bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia, which was classified as a minor criterion, was observed in 23 patients (96%); only one patient died without proven arrhythmia from rapidly progressing heart failure.	2.3265405732501776
A previous history of unexpected sudden death in family members as a minor criterion arose in 3 of 19 patients (15%).	2.1866466190262797
The complied task force criteria for the diagnosis of AVRD led in all 24 cases to the diagnosis of the disease, whereby the value of a determined histological diagnosis was the gold standard.	2.6864183382633717
Without inclusion of histological data, the clinical diagnosis was determined in only 10 cases.	2.5697327752999874
The question remains whether with a simple division of findings into major and minor criteria a pure clinical diagnosis is possible.	1.9454206503296427
Against the backdrop of two personal observations and a review of the literature, the authors describe clinical and histological features and also the differential diagnosis and therapy and this rare benign neoplasm.	2.2801888985469736
Histological differentiation from squamous cell carcinoma is essential as the prognosis and treatment are different.	2.5508425366053284
SKA is treated by local excision and curettage.	2.359136740793478
Erosions of the underlying distal phalanx usually heal spontaneously.	2.400289671930136
Leukotrienes and prostaglandines are important mediators of inflammation.	2.264817151486189
While prostaglandine synthesis can be influenced by NSAIDs therapeutical approaches to the 5-lipoxygenase pathway are rare.	2.2492035148257807
Resinous extracts of Boswellia serrata (H15, indish incense), known from traditional ayurvedic medicine, decrease leukotriene synthesis in vitro.	1.7594198190145036
Case reports suggest a clinical role for that drug.	2.2460768499891794
Patients received 9 tablets of active drug (3600 mg) or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy.	2.1483964347410773
Doses of NSAIDs could be adjusted on demand.	2.309798447126914
Efficacy parameters, Ritchies Index for swelling and pain, ESR, CRP, pain on VAS and NSAID dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation.	1.9261211421218642
Mean values and medians were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.	1.8276827945786382
Results: A total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers, the data have been published in abstractform.	2.4684849229918506
Only 37 patients (verum 18, placebo 19), enrolled in Ratingen were available for detailled efficacy and safety analysis.	2.073051709092677
All evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator (G.H.).	2.5648338393592023
There was no subjective, clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.	1.7086881908179565
The mean NSAID dose reduction reached levels of 5.8% (H15) and 3.1% (placebo).	1.882400541471694
One patient in each group showed a good response in all parameters but 4 patients in each group worsened.	2.339234199379802
The others showed no alteration of their disease.	2.3291983222810995
Conclusion: Treatment with H15 showed no measurable efficacy.	2.207713557369382
Controlled studies including a greater patient population are necessary to confirm or reject our results.	2.2175844845412076
A 61-year-old woman with depression developed recurring elevated itching erythematous lesions in light-exposed areas after taking St. John's Wort-extract for three years.	1.8617230016668536
Routine patchtesting did not reveal any relevant reactions and photopatch testing was negative.	2.100977760683055
Using a systemic oral photoprovocation test with St. John's Wort, we were able to demonstrate a decrease of the MED-UVB which was reversible after withdrawal of the medication.	2.026530851312475
Due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques.	1.9872996545767008
High flow phases for wash-in or wash-out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short, the difference between the volatile's concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small, and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia.	2.117636976204958
The monitoring, required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients, corresponds to the current obliging technical safety standards.	2.376794370055919
Low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash-out of trace gases.	2.1113586235544086
Thoroughly the use of sevoflurane with dry soda lime must be avoided, as this volatile in an extreme exothermic reaction is absorbed nearly totally and degraded to a considerable degree by dry carbon dioxide absorbent.	1.9279844694248882
The gaseous degradation products are pungent and possibly may be harmful to the patients.	2.1872107755724914
Only by low flow anaesthesia the use of sevoflurane will gain an economically and ecologically acceptable range of efficiency.	2.2143258726609907
Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.	2.384354437854685
The typical delay from the onset of acute infarction to the development of cardiogenic shock and well defined risk factors allow for an early identification of patients at risk.	2.355798870789987
Immediate restoration of coronary artery patency by thrombolysis or PTCA can prevent cardiogenic shock in a number of these patients.	2.4359026263641366
Patients presenting with frank cardiogenic shock should be approached with diagnostic vigor in an attempt to identify a treatable lesion.	1.9176508594726374
Several non-randomized studies suggest that PTCA is superior to thrombolysis in patients with shock and ongoing ischemia.	2.5187872859484974
However, aortic counterpulsation may enhance reperfusion rates achieved by thrombolytic therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock.	2.272333788541814
Early surgery is required in patients with shock due to mechanical complications, such as acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum.	2.74789672456284
Ventricular assist devices can be used in selected patients with refractory shock as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.	2.44272596522005
We report on a 4.6 year old girl, presenting with signs of subacute valve malfunction; in her cerebrospinal fluid koagulase-negative staphylococcus could be cultured, and the CF protein was elevated.	1.9692419868796025
Bidimensional echocardiography demonstrated a large thrombus on the distal part of the shunt.	2.4998893924215295
The thrombus protruded into the right ventricle during diastole.	2.4047376371213507
The child underwent cardiotomy and thrombectomy.	2.3483002225502703
Object of this review is to present the physiological principles, diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis.	2.3040866446564157
Despite intense research activities in this area, many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear.	2.140312452018806
For example, the often discussed shift of the critical value of oxygen delivery to higher values in sepsis has not been proven, yet.	2.149703771263794
Beside an impaired regional perfusion also disturbances in the cellular oxygen utilization may be responsible for organ failure in sepsis.	2.104520817760778
Until now, it was not shown, whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients.	2.245487739631058
In future further research is necessary to solve the problems associated with sepsis therapy.	2.3857351866849754
The rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration is a quite involved procedure associated with many potential dangers.	2.268704274656814
A new nasogastric balloon tube has been developed, which will prevent the reflux of gastric contents by blocking the cardia with a balloon.	1.9587874081499446
It was the aim of this initial study to assess the efficiency of the tube in animals, healthy volunteers and patients.	2.5892688167214266
With the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee, a total of 16 anaesthetised pigs were used for the animal experiments.	2.300830575028501
Vomiting and regurgitation was provoked in each animal using six different manoeuvres while the gastro-oesophageal (lower oesophageal) sphincter and intragastric pressures were monitored and the lower oesophagus was continuously inspected using an endoscope.	1.733350787397358
With local Ethics Committee approval and informed written consent, (1) repeated vomiting was provoked in 16 awake, healthy adult volunteers (10 females, 6 males, 29 +/- 4 years) with a fluid-filled stomach in the presence and in the absence of balloon occlusion of the cardia, while intragastric pressure was monitored, and (2) 30 patients (21 - 89 years) with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration scheduled for abdominal or traumatologic surgery received conventional induction of anesthesia after blocking of the cardia with the balloon.	2.1671251602948267
Pigs (n=10) with a blocked cardia showed no gastrooesophageal reflux during a total of 60 manipulations to provoke vomiting and regurgitation, while 28 of the 36 provoking manipulations induced reflux in pigs (n=6) with an unblocked cardia.	2.1212388585957735
Among the healthy volunteers with a blocked cardia (n=16), reflux of gastric contents was not observed during repeated attempts to stimulate vomiting.	1.9956031399202363
After termination of the occlusion of the cardia, reflux was able to be induced by 14 of the 16 volunteers.	2.296405435618568
In 30 patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration the cardia was blocked and anaesthesia was induced using a mask and manual ventilation without encountering any problems.	2.065688895836069
It is concluded from the present results, with further clinical studies pending, that the gastric balloon probe permits low-risk conventional induction sequence of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk for pulmonary aspiration and that the device may also be safely used during the extubation phase.	2.286238176624168
The article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by Weiss and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioristic theories and therapeutic techniques.	1.918058621445275
The basic assumption is: pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals.	2.0764320434636048
Patients are unconsciously motivated to overcome pathogenic beliefs.	2.1745979369771793
In psychotherapy, the patient works to disprove pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist.	2.297083548542024
In this way patients achieve corrective emotional experiences.	2.1418707116373246
The theory is supported by numerous empirical studies.	2.375513379953808
Treatment with "nootropic drugs" of patients suffering from dementia is often described as arbitrary.	2.2978385089094786
To define the potential usefulness of nootropic drugs, effects and side effects, economic aspects in comparison to other treatment approaches were studied.	2.360640773859232
A summary of literature published concerning these criteria underlines the efficacy of nootropics in improving the symptoms at the beginning and in postponing the progress of the disease.	2.081441782414072
The majority of substances does not lead to severe side effects.	2.2590321068532764
There are not enough studies comparing the effects of the substances or on prophylactic effects.	2.5998087798681233
Delayed admission to care units leads to a positi- ve cost effect of nootropics.	2.200907570046721
Thus, also for economic reasons it seems advisable to treat patients with nootropics.	2.160187459208357
Better effects are gained when nootropic treatment is combined with training and changing of the structure of the environment.	2.228968510285398
Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) as a contrast for magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and the use of high-dose dynamic studies for predicting the response to preoperative chemotherapy.	2.5074492403539876
Simulation has gained an important role in medical education and continuing education in the field of anaesthesia and emergency medicine.	2.5697457944100086
Acceptance of training seems enhanced by inclusion of the human factor aspect, since this has proven  to be a major source for the development of critical situations in our specialty.	2.4988878777486274
Furthermore, drawbacks of the simulators available and the current training availability in Germany is described.	2.0620232772744242
We evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure (ptiO2) and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in ten anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits (body weight 2.5 +/- 0.5 kg).	1.7333880732750608
CBF [hydrogen desaturation (clearance)-technique) and ptiO2 (Licox-microsensor) right frontoparietal cortex] were determined.	1.8197320863716526
Rewarming period was started after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest and the rabbits were weaned from CPB without the use of any inotropic or vasoactive support.	2.0412113425225566
Under baseline conditions, ptiO2 was 38 +/- 5 mmHg and did not change significantly before DHCA.	2.074531648500917
During DHCA the ptiO2 decreased within 15 minutes to 14 +/- 5 mmHg, after 30 minutes to 5 +/- 1 mmHg and after 40 minutes to zero.	2.0117604440007324
Neither the ptiO2 nor CBF recovered fully following restoration of bypass flow and reperfusion: ptiO2 (25 +/- 4 mmHg vs. baseline: 38 +/- 5 mmHg, p<0.05) and CBF (43 +/- 8 vs. baseline: 68 +/- 11 ml/100 g/min, p<0.05) were significantly reduced.	2.1053503608952284
Arterial and jugular-venous lactate levels increased after rewarming (p<0.05) and corresponded to the appearance of a anaerobic metabolism.	2.106365089246956
These data demonstrate significantly decreased levels of ptiO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) and CBF (oxygen supply) during and after rewarming from DHCA.	1.9066794064815644
The induced impairment of recovery persists after rewarming and generates a temporary low-flow situation with delayed brain tissue reoxygenation on the cellular/mitochondrial level.	1.933680981495691
While initially advocated primarily for intrasurgical visualization (e. g., craniotomy), interventional MRI rapidly evolved into roles in image-guided localization for needle-based procedures, minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures, and thermal ablation of cancer.	1.7982510656191102
In this contest, MRI pulse sequences and scanning methods serve one of four primary roles: (1) speed improvement, (2) device localization, (3) anatomy/lesion differentiation and (4) temperature sensitivity.	2.127754395875276
A 74-years old patient is admitted to the hospital with a over a period of 4 years growing, scrotal, ulcerated tumor.	2.21254331797966
There is no connection to the testicle or the epididymis palpable.	2.0519628590050814
All laboratory findings including the tumorparameters are normal.	2.2841457525432562
The scrotal sonography shows a solid tumor, that is filled with vessels in the Doppler sonography.	2.1346551963155114
The complete tumor resection with histological examination leads to the diagnosis of a scrotal leiomyoma.	2.647483092442852
This rare, benign tumor is a differential diagnosis to paratesticular or non-germinal tumors.	2.291498707664711
Although most of them are very rare, knowledge about their reproducible clinicopathological features is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls.	2.4471840576087662
These lesions include: bacillary angiomatosis, a vasoproliferative, pseudoneoplastic infection of immunocompromised patients caused by Rochalimaea henselae; tufted angioma, a variant of lobular capillary haemangioma characterised by a "cannon-ball" distribution of multiple lobules composed of packed capillaries and pericytes; microvenular haemangioma, a cutaneous haemangioma composed of thin-walled and irregularly branching blood vessels which dissect dermal collagen; sinusoidal haemangioma, a distinctive variant of cavernous haemangioma which may be located in the subcutaneous breast tissue and then may be confused with well-differentiated angiosarcoma; "hobnail haemangioma" (targetoid haemosiderotic haemangioma), a benign vascular tumour with a distinctive clinical targetoid appearance and a hobnail cytomorphology of the prominent endothelial tumour cells; retiform haemangioendothelioma, a very recently characterised low-grade angiosarcoma occurring most commonly in the extremities of adolescents which is characterised by arborising blood vessels arranged in a retiform pattern and lined by hobnail-like prominent endothelial cells; Kaposi-like infantile haemangioendothelioma, a borderline malignant tumour of infants mimicking Kaposi's sarcoma histologically; epithelioid angiosarcoma, a highly aggressive tumour in the spectrum of epithelioid vascular lesions which stains positively for endothelial and epithelial immunohistological markers; benign lymph-angioendothelioma (progressive lymphangioma), a benign, slowly growing macule or plaque which has to be distinguished from well-differentiated angiosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma; and lymphangiomatosis of the limbs, a poorly recognised angiomatosis occurring in young patients and limited mainly to the limbs with a favourable prognosis.	1.6449770004468538
Cardial features of the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) are congenital cataract, mental retardation, hypotonia and renal tubular dysfunction.	1.9859825129037671
The primary biochemical defect remains unknown.	2.334573007288645
An inborn error of the inositol phosphate metabolism as a result of mutations within the OCRL gene localized on the X-chromosome is discussed.	2.0486718749413586
Experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in man.	2.7721246809851605
Ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable.	1.8790893507602675
Because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory, such as microelectrode recording of transmembrane action potentials and high-density optical and electrical activation mapping, animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies.	2.2677647814865245
Studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias.	2.3925914446372727
Animal models have enabled the mechanisms of fibrillation and defibrillation to be understood and new therapeutic concepts to be developed.	2.1220428396087763
The purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.	2.0150435126179613
Some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed.	2.246614285103086
Because of the clinical importance of coronary artery disease this article concentrates on those arrhythmias caused by myocardial ischaemia and infarction.	2.4136394080675125
The authors report a rare, recently diagnosed and atypical mishap during one-lung ventilation (OLV) via a double lumen tube (DLT) and left-sided thoracotomy: an ipsilateral pneumothorax during ventilation of the right lung.	1.9950319856360135
This occurred in a 63-year-old patient with chronic obstructive airway disease who was scheduled for urgent repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.	2.16822763496843
Anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful until aortic cross-clamping release.	2.2059656712926565
The common presentation of increased intrathoracic extrapleural pressure owing to a pneumothorax in patients with mechanically ventilated lungs is a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation, followed or paralleled by haemodynamic deterioration.	2.008494935639259
Although the above presentation could be seen in this case, the diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax was delayed twice.	2.8390904187234973
First, symptoms were initially obscured by haemodynamic changes resulting from a head-down tilt and aortic declamping.	1.9805089763553068
Second, since the lack of consolidation after aortic declamping focused attention on the airway problems, complications resulting from the use of a DLT were primarily considered.	2.292689780720396
In particular, since breathing sounds were detectable initially, malposition or torsion of the DLT had to be excluded by fibre-optic bronchoscopy, which involved a further delay.	1.9195884093173445
Finally, two observations led to the diagnosis of a right-sided tension pneumothorax: (1) bullae of the contralateral lung, detected during thoracotomy; (2) the finding that ventilation of both lungs and the left lung subsequently increased arterial (SaO2) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and the circulatory status, but ventilation of the right lung caused a deterioration.	2.249586238261061
Chest radiography and insertion of a chest tube with drainage of air, thereafter, validated our hypothesis.	1.9785861847075628
The time course of oxygen desaturation during OLV and tension pneumothorax was as severe as expected; the time course of haemodynamic deterioration, however, appeared quicker and had more impact than expected.	2.1143076977306925
Assuming that mediastinal deviation was not hindered by contralateral intrathoracic pressure during thoracotomy, we believed that circulation should be depressed later or to a lesser extent in patients with an intraoperative pneumothorax.	2.115024500251876
Yet, during thoracotomy, decrease in cardiac filling and output during tension pneumothorax in OLV obviously results primarily from the immovability of the mediastinum owing to mediastinal fixation and is at least as decisive as the contralateral intrathoracic pressure in closed-chest patients.	1.8013917695038608
In summary, a tension pneumothorax during one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy is a rare, but disastrous complication during the use of a DLT, which has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously.	2.326194918758063
The intramedullary hip screw system Classic-Nail and the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) were evaluated in a prospective-randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.	2.1062790283656687
Hundred and ten geriatric patients (mean age 82 years) were runningly included in the study (56 Classic Nail, 54 DHS).	2.306752423389556
No significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow-up data.	2.980261097394191
With the Classic-Nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occured at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires.	1.829350445096621
In the DHS group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively.	2.024148381924284
At an avarage follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups.	2.3256424068417254
- Classic Nail and DHS both lead to equally good results in the operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.	2.1678698711076905
The internal fixation of fractures of shaft bones was spread out by a group of surgeons working together with Prevot.	2.333011894401319
The principle of this method is a three point load carrying(entry point, height of fracture and cancellous bone of the metaphysis of the opposite fracture part).	1.9880962417111183
From 1996 to 1999 86 children with fractures of the humerus, the fore-arm and the femur were operated in the technique of intramedullary nailing.	2.21982391568484
The fractures affected the humerus to 3.5 %, the fore-arm to 65.1 % and the femoral shaft to 31.4 %.	1.9270918292353827
The postoperativ duration of stay in hospital after internal fixation of the fore-arm in the proximal and middle third lasted 7.2 days, the duration of immobilisation in a cast took 13.7 days.	2.1708096443247413
96 % of the patients showed very good and good results after operation.	3.047724980249188
The average stay in hospital for patients with femoral shaft fractures was 14.4 days.	2.380428709581641
17 weeks after operation the intramedullary nails were removed.	2.4513371811286984
At the time of first full weight bearing the legs showed an average shortening of 1.2 cm.	2.1842382983682334
The fractures of the humerus healed without any restriction of movements.	2.6369863991250933
Internal fixation is a minimal invasive operation technique with low risks and small operating trauma.	2.2453220291587255
Due to the stability a early mobilisation is possible.	2.1777916641941903
The reported results in the literature are all good.	3.364343978720314
The only problem can be caused by too long nails irritating the skin.	2.2311178844859043
Objectives Relief of pain in therapy-resistant lateral epicondylitis through denervation and indirect decompression of the deep branch of the radial nerve through detachment of the supinator muscle only.	1.9939516952916725
Physiology and age dependant changes of human bone marrow are described.	2.2318670979448987
The resulting normal distribution patterns of active and inactive bone marrow including the various contrasts on different MR-sequences are discussed.	1.8714942104036625
This report is based upon experience with 592 implantations of Swanson silastic spacer between 1978 and 1992.	1.9188107131864853
The results of 430 cases were followed up in 1995.	2.365148455627666
Complications were observed in 31 cases and required further surgery.	2.4685223294029166
In 18 cases, the spacer was resected; in 2 cases a distal amputation was necessary.	2.3703648727360105
Due to pain, the spacer was changed in 11 cases, in 5 cases from a single-stem to a double-stem version.	2.3953396828274394
Radiological reactions increase over time following the operation without correlation to pain.	2.1993482129984776
The results in cases of rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis disease are compared.	2.7454152560001375
Approximately 80 % of the patients are free of pain and more than 90 % are satisfied with the functional results.	3.0738898189464283
The results of the arthrosis group are slightly better.	2.19320229607121
Introduction: The goal of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced T1-weighted Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences with conventional spin-echo sequences as a basis for planning high-precision radiotherapy.	2.0470897069142695
Methods: A total of 25 consecutive patients with different intracranial tumors and a disrupted blood-brain barrier were studied.	2.3564859092729793
T1-weighted Flash, Turbo-Flash and conventional spin-echo images were evaluated after controlled 30-s infusion of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of Gd-DTPA.	1.9732405855815376
The evaluation of the three sequences included the measurement of the signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios, the visual inspection of the tumors and artifacts, and the measurement of tumor size.	2.633948435358674
Results: The signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) lower for Flash and Turbo-Flash than for conventional spin-echo sequences.	2.0265370816342485
However, visual inspection of the contrast-enhancing tumors revealed in 23 and 24 of 25 lesions on Flash and Tu-rbo-Flash images, respectively, good or very good tumor visibility when compared with conventional spin-echo images with a reduction of imaging time by a factor of 7-8.	1.9648560205604475
Tumor sizes were comparable in all three techniques.	2.6975548845641453
Conclusion: At present, conventional spin-echo images are superior to fast Flash and ultrafast Turbo-Flash sequences as a basis for accurate target volume definition in high-precision radiotherapy.	1.9483728365987316
However, fast Flash and Turbo-Flash images may be a practicable alternative to conventional spin-echo images for tumors in the posterior fossa or in patients unable to tolerate a stereotactic fixation device.	1.9952501163766538
Despite some limitations, Turbo-Flash sequences enable fast dynamic MR imaging combined with an acceptable morphology, which may be sufficient for target volume planning in high-precision radiotherapy.	1.9929475686560285
Cystic tumors of the neck are usually cysts, inflamatory masses, lymph nodes, benign and malignant tumors or metastases.	2.527805404938231
Ectopic salivary tissue is a rather rare but clinically important malformation.	2.422408864870713
Accessory and aberrant tissue can be identified histologically.	2.4777460057236875
There may be an association with lymphatic tissue.	2.4085465865429265
Possible complications include inflammation as well as the development of benign and in rare cases malignant salivary gland tumors.	2.710682378913935
We report on two patients who underwent surgical treatment under the tentative diagnosis of epidermal cysts which histologically turned out to be ectopic parotid tissue.	1.9704640975567662
Nucleotides are low molecular weight biological compounds that play major roles in almost all-biological processes.	2.03731409360762
Cell nucleic acids and nucleotides are continuously synthesised, degraded and salvaged.	1.952160410291009
The body's pools derive from three potential sources: synthesis de novo, salvage (recycling of preformed bases) and the diet.	1.9334791648319987
It is generally accepted that de novo synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines from amino acid precursors is capable of supporting the cellular needs for nucleic acid synthesis.	1.6990984629144674
When protein intake is decreased or in situations in which there are a high demand of nucleotides synthesis (after gut injury, after surgical trauma, sepsis, rapid growth: pregnancy or newborn infants, etc.)	1.9209028037998348
some tissues with a rapid turnover (gut and immune system) may increase the salvage of exogenous nucleotides coming from the diet.	1.962625866096549
Therefore, nucleotides may become conditionally essential nutrients.	2.1717982435259144
This article discusses the possible beneficial effects of dietary nucleotides on small intestine (maturation and recovery) and gut microflora, lipid and hepatic metabolism and on the immune system.	2.010547327807203
Human milk is the best source of nucleotides for young infants and the nucleotide/nucleoside profile of it shows a substantial predominance for pyrimidines as compared to purines.	2.035322690818252
Moreover, pyrimidine nucleotides seem to be better preserved in breast milk during storage in the breast and during digestion in the small intestine and they are more absorbed and incorporated into tissue RNA, as compared to purine ones.	1.9909586487495305
Additional research should be done to improve the design of nucleotides supplemented infant formulas.	2.5393207732714074
This includes: 1) to investigate in vivo if the incorporation of dietary nucleotides in tissue RNA is enhanced in situations of stress or rapid growth and 2) to study the biological effects of individually administered purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.	1.961557587753651
Parkinson's disease (PD) causes significant expense for the national health care system due to its chronic progressive course, the duration of the disease, the high prevalence and the devastating prognosis.	2.4373396678887937
In Germany more than DM 320 million are spent for drugs to alleviate parkinsonian symptoms.	1.889428919914825
The aim of this study was to calculate the economic burden of PD by assessing direct medical costs.	1.8947580895127314
Forty patients suffering from idiopathic PD were interviewed at an office of neurological specialists and at an outpatient movement disorder clinic about their use of health care resources 3 months prior to the study.	2.1154289101569574
The total annual costs reported were DM 14,500, consisting of DM 6500 for drug therapy and DM 8000 for other medical services, including hospital inpatient care (DM 5600), outpatient care (DM 700), medical sundries (DM 1100) and physiotherapy (DM 600).	1.6831792732215205
The costs were positively correlated to the extent of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage; HY) and the occurrence of motor fluctuations/dyskinesias.We found that both drug-therapy expenses and total medical costs doubled from HYI to HYIV.	2.0995627493232787
The rarely employed s.c. therapy with apomorphine additionally increased the costs of drug therapy in HYV.	2.0771754292923506
The occurrence of fluctuations/ dyskinesias also increased medical expenses by approximately a factor of two.	1.8994100461345829
Indirect burden due to increased days off of work, unemployment and earlier retirement are also significant in Parkinson's disease.	1.9308594880761698
This study oncludes that a treatment which could prevent or retard disease progression as well as a treatment that delays or reduces motor complications would not only ameliorate the situation of patients suffering from PD, but would also lead to significant reductions in cost for the national health care system.	1.964047357127878
The cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue is essentially intended to maintain fertility and endocrinological function in female cancer patients and female patients at increased risk of early menopause.	1.993534152636861
After having been frozen and subsequently thawed, the tissue can, ideally, be transplanted to its original site, where it leads to spontaneous fertilisation.	1.8561454152457304
Heterotopic transplantations are also discussed as autografts or xenotransplants in SCID mice.	2.111531499273177
In addition to the use of whole tissue, the isolation of individual follicles and their in vitro maturation (IVM) are discussed.	2.252672980422798
As in the case of heterotopic transplantation of ovarian tissue, pregnancy can only be achieved in these cases by in vitro fertilisation of the matured oocytes.	2.4029275130980436
Although considerable progress has already been made in both directions, these are still, at the present time, experimental processes that require further in-depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application.	1.9752945389282042
In addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, IVM of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction.	1.8744738156368896
The successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation.	2.4223211927995383
IVM is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of PCOS patients, for instance, increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by "rescuing" IVF cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes.	2.0458417234034685
Background: Transconjunctival peribulbar anesthesia is reported to permit better identification of the bulbar limits because of a better view into the fornix; it is also said to be less painful compared to transcutaneous peribulbar anesthesia.	2.049337222300793
The aim of our study was to compare the two injection techniques.	2.1546060176956248
The German Registry for Hearing Loss in Children (DZH) processes nationwide data from audiological centers.	1.7950580390422681
Coping with the accrued data and its subsequent management and analysis requires a high degree of security and control.	2.128052686724402
To establish a nationwide registry it is necessary at an early stage to take into consideration the legal requirements of the participating states.	2.242187680279416
Use of the DZH as an example demonstrates how a pragmatic solution can be reached.	2.199567525128523
Special issues concerning data collection, transfer, storage and deletion, coding strategies to ensure anonymity, checking for duplicate entries, data separation, and automated data analysis and data protection are explained.	1.702932490939389
Cardiac fibroblasts are known to have high affinity corticoid receptors for aldosterone and account for the accumulation of collagen within the interstitium of the rat myocardium in acquired and genetic hypertension.	1.9351165675961608
This interstitial fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy in chronic heart failure.	2.3618694426897577
The social environment in which obstetrics is offered today is characterized by a mentality of weariness: weariness by affluence, ignorance and by misunderstanding.	1.9071182164503033
As a final result an unscientific era comes about, on which Karl Jaspers commented in 1945 that only this unscientific spirit had made National Socialism possible.	1.6638470615138559
Based on the good statistical results of German obstetrics compared to those of foreign countries, it is shown that our patients' demands for "gentle" obstetrics can be combined with the requirements of safe obstetrics.	2.1887073415758262
If the professional interests of doctors and midwives are joint together, "safe and gentle" obstetrics should result in the common goal of a healthy child and a happy mother.	1.9361065916033278
Objectives: Due to its unique pharmacokinetics, the new esterase-metabolised opioid remifentanil results in rapid post-anaesthesia recovery.	1.9497251741991828
The aim of this clinical investigation was to compare recovery times after remifentanil anaesthesia in combination with hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or isoflurane.	2.208389598455678
Dosages used in the study protocol were based on recommendations by the pharmaceutical manufacturer.	2.6697589117697422
Methods: Patients (ASA status I-II) scheduled for elective arthroscopy were included in this trial.	2.1267880864962323
Without premedication in the morning, anaesthesia was induced identically in both groups: remifentanil bolus (1 µg/kg), start of remifentanil-infusion (0.5 µg/kg/min), followed immediately by propofol (ca.	2.17715498385199
For maintenance of anaesthesia remifentanil (0.25 µg/kg/min) was combined with either a propofol infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min or 0.5 MAC isoflurane (=0.6 vol.%) in O2/air.	2.0976489360313026
Anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously with termination of surgery and recovery times were recorded.	2.236241371008319
Results: A total of 40 patients were studied at random in two groups of 20 each with comparable demographic data and anaesthetic technique (Tables 1 and 2).	2.0414536911364958
In both groups emergence was very rapid.	2.3136820027502125
Recovery times were significantly shorter for remifentanil-isoflurane than for remifentanil-propofol (Table 3): spontaneous ventilation 5.1 vs 8.1 min (P<0.05), extubation 5.5 vs. 8.6 min (P<0.02), post-anaesthesia recovery score >=9 of 10 points 6.2 vs 11.3 min (P<0.01), and arrival at PACU 16.2 vs 19.2 min (P<0.01).	1.9686336185124942
Mild to moderate shivering was noted in 40% of all patients (9 cases following isoflurane, 7 following propofol).	2.2374410456754137
Conclusions: Using the manufacturer's recommended dosages, emergence after remifentanil anaesthesia is more rapid with 0.5 MAC isoflurane than with 0.1 mg/kg/min propofol.	2.007196722998365
These results are most probably due to the different pharmacological properties of both co-anaesthetics, especially the applied dosages, and to different interactions with remifentanil.	2.3743852416685343
Present clinical experience suggests that a further dose reduction, especially for propofol, is possible.	2.3163014922109957
For both remifentanil groups emergence was remarkably rapid between return of consciousness and the awake state (on-off phenomenon), which might contribute to post-anaesthesia safety.	2.0390206427810167
Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma, with UVA possibly playing an important role.	3.007244336028404
Hereditary factors are also relevant.	2.6447592601452907
In the dysplastic nevus syndrome a genetic instability has been shown by different methods.	2.3114947379981494
In xeroderma pigmentosum the DNA repair defect is thought to be responsible for the high incidence of malignant melanoma.	2.492520453708783
Frequent and non-random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells.	2.3350978396020072
These might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes.	2.000287176652387
Especially the short arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one of these genes.	2.4331556529951
This hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas.	2.143598131873256
Changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma, but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known.	2.1200316513876585
Neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood's epilepsy.	2.2630041351645507
Up to now it is not totally understood if focal EEG-pathology represents a specific cognitive deficit strongly related to the corresponding hemisphere's functions or represents a less lateralized but more general cognitive deficit of both cerebral hemispheres.	1.888183665748662
In a sample of 44 pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing.	2.0105990939997933
As a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing (more sequential than simultaneous) has been found.	2.0674191465579814
There was no correlation with the localization of an EEG-Focus nor with the hand preference.	2.1447516423929702
According to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment.	2.1591714813896488
The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced shock strength in transvenous implantable defibrillator therapy.	2.222540558857944
So far clinical data concerning the safety margin of the shock energy in ICD therapy do not exist.	2.022576317609505
The shock energy tested during long-term follow-up in this study was twice the intraoperatively measured defibrillation threshold (DFT).	2.577767093284252
All patients received a non-thoracotomy lead system (CPI, Endotak 0070, 0090) and a biphasic cardioverter-defibrillator with the ability to store episodes (Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., Ventac TM PRx II, PRx III).	1.869776603665662
The intraoperative defibrillation threshold (DFT) was evaluated in a step-down protocol (15, 10, 8, 5 J) and hat to be <=15 J for inclusion into the study.	2.112854495621644
The DFT+ value was tested immediately after successful implantation, at discharge, and after a follow-up period of one year.	2.4565552166585714
Prior to implantation the patients were randomized into two groups.	2.603325358270898
The energy of the first shock in the study group was programmed at twice DFT+ and in the control group at the maximum energy output (34 J).	2.519801629109477
The efficacy of the first shock and its reproducibility in DFT testings and in spontaneous episodes during long-term follow-up of the study group were compared to those in the control group.	2.6515888384919393
A DFT+ value was found to be <=15 J in 166 of 176 patients (94%).	2.2484170754133355
The DFT+ in the study group was 9.6+/-3.2; in control group 10.1+/-.35 J.	2.079242407807745
The prohability of successful defibrillation at DFT+ level after one year was 84%.	2.04056297489236
The success rate of the first shock meant to terminate induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 99.5% in the study group (217 of 218 episodes) and 99% in the control group (201 of 203 episodes).	2.118959220867794
In the control group the first shock was successful in 151/156 (96.8%) spontaneous MVTs and in 30/33 (91%) VF episodes.	2.025610957294784
The efficacy of the first shock was not influenced by clinical data such as the underlying cardiac disease, left ventricular function, ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone, or the number of spontaneous episodes per day or by the DFT itself.	2.37849336616046
Thus, the safety of ICD-therapy is not impaired when programming the shock energy at the 2x DFT+ value.	2.1083043644285557
Culpable deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete illegality of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage.	2.1811404953238704
In cases of controversy it's the physician's due to prove the correct preoperative information.	2.046736729855644
To reduce these liability-risks a computer based information system has been developed.	2.1846168672264463
With its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient.	2.0106814161924347
Based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place.	2.1372041087181897
After the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information.	1.8807735329405642
The conception's use over many years shows that overlooking essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached.	2.2287456354763497
In vitro culture of peritoneal explants of neonatal rats after previous application of agents simulating wound antisepsis is a sensitive screening method for the determination of the tissue compatibility of local wound antiinfectives.	2.0337915178332397
Two test models are differentiated: (1) separated peritoneal explants as a model for chronic or deep wounds and (2) peritoneum in situ in the experimental animal with subsequent extraction and cultivation of the explants.	1.995668977203782
Considering the present state of knowledge the following conclusions can be drawn regarding antisepsis of wounds: Lavasept (0.1 %) may be classified as the agent of choice for deep and chronic wounds, for drip-suck irrigation and for antiinfective lavage of body cavities inclusively for peritoneal lavage (0,05 %).	1.8681457652120845
Taurolidin is antiseptically effective in long term application ( > 6 h), and because of its antitoxic effect as well as lack of cytotoxicity it is especially suitable for peritoneal lavage.	2.538970259707145
Betaisodona solution is very well suited for superficial contaminated wounds and can be used in a dilution of 1 : 10 for short-term rinsing of deep wounds, including body cavities but not for peritoneal lavage.	2.2099566190386484
Ethanol causes no inhibition of explant growth and therefore retains its importance in wound antisepsis.	2.00114116355296
Pain is a widely occurring disturbance of well-being and has serious consequences for the quality of life of patients suffering from acute or chronic pain.	2.6371495946966697
For the first time in the Federal Republic of Germany the National Health Interview and Examination Survey allows to make representative statements concerning the prevalence of pain, its intensity, frequency, duration and localisation.	1.9391052785473752
Furthermore, the results enable to differentiate according to age, gender, and social classes.	2.3054016762481684
The SF-36, used as an instrument to measure health related quality of life, has been employed to demonstrate the overwhelming significance of pain for the well-being of the population.	2.447672826865857
In this publication the connection between certain disease syndromes like migraine and arthrosis and the prevalence of different qualities of pain is investigated.	2.0508783501829715
Additional more complex evaluation of the epidemiological data on pain are in preparation.	2.499243875778456
In order to get an effective therapy of Tinea capitis drug must penetrate into the follicles.	1.884007189597987
This can not be obtained exclusively by local treatment so that a combination with systemic therapy is necessary.	2.3579250422968023
Griseofulvin is the drug of choice in childhood until now.	2.702495820464745
We report about this type of acute death in two males.	2.3391704156538253
In both cases, a cocaine intoxication was taken as the cause of death despite an initial suspicion of a direct association between the death and police measures (e.g.	2.0807996842593117
neck compression or "headlock", chest compression).	2.248451298858363
From the Institute's autopsy material we selected another 12 cases with monointoxication by cocaine as the cause of death of as a secondary finding for comparison.	1.9508859009733435
Of the 12 cases 5 were gunshot injuries and 4 were classified as suicide.	2.1738635143982847
The analysis suggested an increased willingness to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine.	2.0736657610196763
In both cases, cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were unaware of any acute life-threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the suspects to flee or resist arrest.	1.9022601639168968
Attention should be given to these types of cases during the training of police officers.	2.2321545567440846
Abstract  Hepatitis C antibodies have been detected in more then half of all autopsies of drug-related deaths in a 2-year period since November 1995 in Aachen, Germany.	2.2182424621407852
It was of interest whether there is a risk of HCV transmission from the corpses.	2.446006056014001
The presence of HCV-RNA indicates infectiosity in the living but this may be different post-mortem.	2.004870391649867
To our knowledge no case of HVC infection from a corpse has been reported so far.	2.1076247523366476
Non-traumatic duodenocaval fistulae are rare, but may be the source of massive gastrointestional bleeding with associated fever and sepsis.	2.3267579351213996
These fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen.	1.9758936575441672
The outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs.	2.214991409676285
The therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava.	2.1219543708890023
We describe the seventh case with radiogenic duodenal ulcer.	2.096557122369317
Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred 10 years after radical nephrectomy and radiation (60 Gy).	2.219792534190785
The patient survived following partial pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple).	2.0318488225581888
Purpose: Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) induces variable functional deficits depending on the grade of vascular occlusion and its localisation.	2.088992538316284
Theses deficiences are not easily defined by visual acuity measurements.	2.232793655886203
However, microperimetry offers topical mapping of retinal function, allowing precise documentation of the intensity and dimension of retinal functional loss in BRVO.	1.9095061158332998
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is rare but beset with a high mortality rate.	2.3562570588162375
In recent years, however, a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed.	2.3585411455505123
This had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy.	2.1934077488329646
Mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ARDS have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung, prevent oxygen toxicity, recruit the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space.	1.6757977746658737
This new approach consists of various forms of pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation with PEEP and permissive hypercapnia, body position changes, and inhalation of nitric oxide.	1.9823473786507608
Should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option.	2.052811610363187
None of these therapeutic procedures, however, has been tested against traditional standard treatment in a classical randomised controlled trial.	2.555612154015306
The following review focuses on the latest insights into the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ARDS.	2.6440216293179435
They can be treated by the use of dynamic hip screws, lag screws, bipolar hemiprotheses or total hip replacement.	2.496925612200851
The results are markedly influenced by the timing of the operation and the choice of the implant.	2.6390583774588574
Using the Garden classification of femoral neck fracture we demonstrate a different therapeutic approach according to Garden stadium I-IV.	1.9925828613301633
Stool frequency after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is about 5/day after adaptation during the first year.	2.1546553668587274
It depends on stool volume and pouch capacity, not on the design of the pouch.	2.3055776950351166
In most cases evacuation is spontaneous and as complete as in healthy rectum.	2.006363936318938
67 % of patients are perfectly continent, while 19 % have to wear pads due to intermittent leakage.	1.9658043058711991
Complete incontinence is reported in 0-4 % of the patients.	2.5693089918337493
Preservation of the anal transitional zone by the double-stapling technique does not improve functional results when compared to endoanal mucosectomy or intersphincteric resection.	1.9919284283774188
Impairment of continence is caused by damage of the internal sphincter with consecutive decrease of the pouch-anal pressure gradient.	2.6022180379051214
Despite altered reflex activity, stool discrimination is preserved in most patients.	2.121204393104846
The loss of colonic water and electrolyte absorption is compensated by decreased renal excretion.	2.0749578723281186
Alterations in bile acid metabolism are lower after IPAA than after ileostomy.	2.045842721682403
Bacterial overgrowth may lead to deterioration of the functional results.	2.85850858136487
Background: Methods from the area of virtual reality are used in oral and maxillofacial surgery for the planning and three-dimensional individual simulation of surgeries.	2.361081016376174
Thirty-seven patients with chronic sinus pilonidalis were treated after total excision by Dufourmentel flap.	2.238067727334681
We saw seroma complications in three and wound infections in two cases.	2.2080643841662697
Patients stayed in hospital 6.3 days on an average and were able to work after 2.5 weeks.	2.332663471107171
The method is easy to use.	2.465628099946862
We have not seen a return to sinus problems in any of this cases.	2.186801675816563
We describe a patient who was admitted to hospital because of hypoglycemic convulsions at the age of 6 months.	2.47464217403652
Diagnostics revealed that the hypoglycemic episodes were caused by glycogen synthase deficiency.	2.319597871545289
Glycogen synthase deficiency its a rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia in childhood associated with normal production of ketone bodies.	1.9724782359537278
Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a reduced activity of glycogen synthase in liver tissue, and lately also by identification of pathogenic mutations in the glycogensynthase gene (GYS2-gene).	1.9048377811440098
Hypoglycemic episodes can be prevented by offering frequent protein-rich meals during the day and a late evening meal with uncooked corn starch.	1.929776861635896
Although most subacromial decompressions are performed arthroscopically, rotator cuff repair is still performed using an open or mini-open procedure.	1.979443154334625
Arthroscopic techniques have improved in the last decade, however, so that rotator cuff repair can also be performed arthroscopically.	2.9386646152457203
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a well-established method for the diagnosis of diseases of the heart and the great vessels.	2.9660056614353603
Almost 20% of all patients cannot be completely examined by transthoracic echocardiography.	2.6078686229228754
In this patient group, MRI can be used as a second line technique to provide important diagnostic information not obtainable by echocardiography.	2.2236850217892905
However, there are clinical problems for which MRI may be used as the first line technique such as complex congenital heart disease, diseases of the great vessels, pericardial disease or cardiac tumors.	2.3450894649074305
MRI is undergoing rapid technical improvement and this will further improve the diagnostic utility of the technique, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.	2.4599701441399255
In the last 7 years we have performed 220 infrainguinal vein bypasses associated with critical limb ischemia.	1.9723703159843902
All patients were prospectively controlled in a follow-up program 3 - 72 months postoperatively.	2.430306666144181
The patients were divided into two groups: patients with diabetes mellitus (35%, group 1) and patients without diabetes mellitus (65%, group 2).	2.2831780882090333
There was no difference in sex, age or localization of distal anastomosis (supra- or infragenicular) between the two groups.	1.9396392996017795
The primary and the primary-assisted patency rates were not statistically different after 60 months.	2.0660660989753414
There was a significant difference in limb salvage.	2.4579116416688604
The limb salvage of group 1 was 75% after 60 months, while the limb salvage of group 2 was 95% (P = 0.0045).	2.092398863735483
The rate of major amputations was significantly higher in group 1 (15.6%) than in group 2 (4.9%, P = 0.007).	2.246087353841429
The indication for amputation was persistent foot infection.	2.1332858635632794
A 24-year-old woman with lymph vessel dysplasia had experienced a progressive edema of her legs since her second year of life and progressive facial edema for the past year.	2.1121451949607377
She also had telangiectasias and papules on the background of a diffuse erythema as well as marked seborrhea on her face.	2.296442980805872
Histopathological examination of a representative facial lesion revealed a granulomatous dermatitis with periadnexal distribution mainly consisting of lymphocytes and histiocytes.	1.887120000170665
In addition, there was a moderate fibrosis of the dermis with numerous mast cells.	2.2017557318615437
By duplex ultrasound, a diagnosis of a massive edema of the legs without evidence for chronic venous insufficiency was made.	2.5443545030792265
The clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with solid persistent erythema and edema of the face associated with rosacea and lymph vessel dysplasia.	2.1442277747507514
The chronic course, absence of serological abnormalities and nonspecific histopathological features as well as resistance to therapy are the most important diagnostic cirteria of this disease also known as Morbihan's disease.	2.5629522932368394
The cervical spine is an extremely complex functional unit and has always been the subject of impassioned discussions among surgeons, orthopedic specialists and neurologists.	2.0454991021522315
In the presence of injuries affecting this section of the spine, which sometimes have grave consequences - including implications for legal insurance aspects, neurologists are usually at the end of the line when it comes to diagnosis and treatment.	2.073813914414248
In fact, in view of the clinical and technical neurophysiological options available to neurologists, it would be desirable for them to be involved as early as possible.	2.2972159580498714
In this paper the relative value of neurology, compared with orthopedics and surgery, in the diagnosis and treatment of whiplash injury to the cervical spine is discussed.	2.52688200815315
The newer options available - particularly in neurophysiology - are highlighted, as are the differential diagnosis and problems concerned with official expert assessments, which also involve other specialties.	1.9192974129508444
A 19-year-old male patient with chronic cutaneous leishmaniosis was treated topically with paromomycin sulphate (15%) and methylbenzethonium chloride (12%) in petrolatum album.	2.0173287813963765
After application twice daily for two periods of 32 and 44 days the lesions were completely healed.	2.038963428544031
Previous treatment for 9 months with ketoconazole (400 mg/day) together with the topical application of thiabendazole (2.5%) in base had been unsuccessful.	2.0241883789340824
No major side effects were observed after paromomycin sulphate application.	2.5121535007293234
Eight patients with spontaneous spinal epidural hemorrhages are presented.	2.2530479424102188
All eight initially had suffered from severe neck or back pain.	2.2699996703202525
In seven cases, progressive neurological deficits had developed, some of which led to complete paraplegia.	2.1620098218199195
On all eight patients operations were performed.	2.4989096263347057
After an average of 11 weeks' follow-up, full recovery from the preoperative pain and neurological deficits could be seen in 6 of the patients.	2.50527954148782
The confusion of scientific, economic, juridical and professional contexts is the reason for the present uneasiness within therapeutic culture.	2.0628149958759243
The author pleads for autonomy of these contexts to defend the profession reasonably against powerful overdetermination by other contexts.	1.7832088002212996
The debate about EST ("empirically supported therapy") is being drawn upon to show that the list of criteria for differentiation of effective and ineffective therapies is not warranted.	1.9303910724932023
Scientific or economic dominance claims might have deteriorating effects in the professional fields, as well-known researchers meanwhile fear.	2.390297919499953
In economic contexts the aim is efficiency, in professional contexts it is quality.	2.0587623338149514
To develop own quality measures has the aim to promote the profession as a learning organization.	2.0367163860912356
This could help to rise professionals' self-confidence.	2.122952381548253
Procalcitonin is the propeptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity.	2.122253350303616
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	1.9368997942315107
In healthy humans procalcitonin levels are undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml).	2.091336942305092
During severe generalized infections (bacterial, parasitic and fungal) with systemic manifestations, procalcitonin levels may rise up to 100 ng/ml.	2.019236914662355
In contrast, severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non-infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels.	2.1649163471784805
The exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity.	2.018321240041995
In this retrospective study, oncologic and functional results of 24 patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages C and D are reported.	2.130080324698946
The surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid-transcervical approach, which was modified according to individual tumor growth.	2.2294575433770065
As needed, this was combined with a transtemporal or retrosigmoid approach.	2.3167879753966667
Complete tumor removal resulted in a cure rate of 100%.	2.496363654301218
Surgically induced cranial nerve palsies developed in 38% of the patients.	2.3737934199874213
In 54% of cases it was possible to retain middle ear function.	2.3859740765301503
Seven patients had incomplete tumor removal requiring postoperative irradiation, with tumor progression occurring in 2 patients.	2.067105222859878
Radical tumor removal was modified by efforts to reduce mutilating resections.	2.1565385810753597
These results show that individually tailored and combined multidirectional surgical approaches can allow total tumor removal to be performed with lower morbidity.	2.0970292298318083
Electron beam CT, which does not require mechanical movement of an X-ray tube, has a temporal resolution which exceeds that of conventional computed tomography by a factor of about ten.	2.0951445159752367
Axial images of the heart can be acquired within 50 to 100 ms with a spatial resolution below 0.5 mm2 and permit precise visualization of all cardiac structures.	1.9659587387903097
ECG-triggered acquisition of 30 to 40 axial images (3 mm slice thickness) in a short inspiratory breathhold allows one to sample a 3-dimensional volume data set which covers the complete heart.	1.929789606492071
Overall acquisition times are approximately 30 to 50 seconds.	2.2259192785050077
Without contrast enhancement, coronary calcification by EBCT currently constitutes the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence even of very early forms of coronary atherosclerosis.	2.0986261753796587
Intraveneous injection of contrast agent during image acquisition additionally permits the selective visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of significant stenoses.	2.1688925490816127
This method is especially well suited in the follow-up of coronary interventions and coronary bypass grafting.	2.3794907507276015
Breathhold and movement artifacts, superposition of coronary arteries and veins, as well as severe coronary calcifications currently constitute the method's main problems.	2.1902533828470436
Despite the availability of diagnostic modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging up to 30% of patients with acute aortic dissection remain undiagnosed before death.	2.512021902508958
A novel immunoassay of serum smooth muscle myosin as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of aortic dissection.	2.4616672327187548
The immunoassay was applied in two patients with an acute chest pain syndrome but no initial suspicion of aortic disease.	2.5270010698619654
In both patients myocardial ischemia was ruled out by laboratory, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination.	1.9938682792213132
In the first patient both dilation of the aortas and long-standing arterial hypertension were known; however, it was not before 48h until dissection was suspected and a spiral-CT was performed demonstrating a localized ascending aortic dissection.	1.9618013907247358
At this time (48 h after onset of symptoms) the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain concentration in the serum was close to normal.	2.1330706656877205
In the other patient there was neither a suggestive history nor any clinical sign of aortic dissection.	2.0124998863764367
Widening of the abdominal was the key to the incidental diagnosis of a clinically unsuspected type B dissection.	2.4023214494308736
The serum test 12 h after onset of pain revealed elevated (diagnostic) serum levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chains.	2.0062240834318894
Recurrent abdominal pain is found in 10-25% of school-aged children, thus being one of the most frequent complaints in childhood.	2.2894010508041376
Despite that, our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete.	2.409081153788866
Following oral surgery, there are sometimes disturbances in wound healing.	2.6384024314408814
It was the aim of this investigation to look for relationships between the composition of saliva and disturbed wound healing.	2.1662318339733257
Resting as well as stimulated fasting whole saliva was collected from 96 patients (19 to 53 years of age) prior to oral surgery.	2.3863511672369775
The salivary data of eight patients who suffered from disturbed wound healing were compared to the data of 20 randomly selected patients with normal wound healing.	2.5487625281975763
Patients with disturbed wound healing revealed increased activities and secretion rates for peroxidase in resting saliva.	1.9582061590596629
In stimulated saliva, decreased secretion rates for thiocyanate and total protein were found.	2.027011178063246
Not a single salivary factor was able to discriminate both groups of patients with sufficient accuracy, but with a combination of tissue type plasminogen activator, peroxidase, plus secretory immunoglobulin A measurements from resting whole saliva a clearly improved and acceptable discrimination of the two patient groups was possible.	2.0318223949226697
A discriminant function including six salivary factors could be used to completely separate both groups.	2.198630331029182
Nuclear imaging methods provide noninvasive indexes of myocardial function, perfusion, and metabolism and are well accepted in clinical cardiology.	2.0539404048380434
The improvement in therapeutic options has increased the demand for diagnostic tests that might guide clinical decision making.	2.0015749882826066
Information beyond the pure anatomic characterization of coronary stenoses is required.	2.199258017689876
Nuclear imaging can be used for early detection and monitoring of the severity and extent of disease.	3.06259219218873
The prognostic potential of such functional testing is being increasingly appreciated and used to guide therapy, thereby resulting in improvement of the quality and cost-effectiveness of the workup of patients with cardiovascular disease.	2.3608657537274103
Extensive clinical validation has resulted in growing acceptance of these techniques.	2.406596916259629
Furthermore, ongoing improvement of imaging techniques and development of new radiopharmaceuticals will pave the way for disease-specific, molecular-targeted cardiac imaging in the future.	2.1902506077450346
Epidural anaesthesia for elective caesarean section can have advantages over general anaesthesia.	2.2081286167989367
The anaesthesiologist can avoid endotracheal intubation as well as fetal depression following placental transfer of systemic anaesthetics.	2.3704124159613387
However, despite reaching an effective blockade preoperatively, intraoperative discomfort and pain may occur during epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics alone, necessitating supplemental systemic analgesics or even conversion to general anaesthesia [21].	1.8417103903421175
Nevertheless, administration of epidural opioids before cord clamping is still hotly debated, some fearing maternal and or neonatal depression [6, 26].	1.8105281752354458
The aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of analgesia, associated side effects and the resulting maternal and neonatal plasma opiate concentrations after a single preoperative addition of 0.1 mg fentanyl to epidural bupivacaine analgesia in comparison to epidural bupivacaine analgesia alone.	2.154693063552952
The quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection.	1.9995609761674091
Even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible, the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a bread-loaf fashion subsequent to formalin-fixation and serial cross-sectioning of the coronary arteries, with decalcification in addition if necessary.	1.8977548169873188
The distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis, the longitudinal, circumferential and transmural extent of infarction, its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by dissecting the heart chambers according to the flow of blood.	2.0393109446182045
Cross-sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing, plaque hemorrhage, parietal and occluding thrombi and the effects and complications of angioplastic procedures or bypass surgery.	2.0112324088123956
Transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short-term territorial ischemia.	2.5736051809171117
Full-thickness samples of the ventricular walls, taken systematically with respect to coronary narrowing and coronary supplying areas, enable identification of early myocardial damage.	2.0724209076685223
Total hip replacement is one of the most successful procedures in surgery.	2.5356263854190635
In Germany there is a great variety of cemented and uncemented implants with different principles of fixation.	2.197834818597461
We reviewed the different principles, with particular reference to long-term clinical outcome, and discuss the most popular systems available in Germany.	2.3401935349149396
Despite many new developments which have been made in the field of cementless hip replacement, cemented total hip arthroplasty will remain the "gold standard" until prospective long-term data (>15 years) of cementless systems become available.	2.3018845487790167
Procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin.	2.4682256761229446
It is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection.	2.352231276517922
In contrast, procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non-infectious systemic inflammatory states.	2.036611563202304
Because of these properties, procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis.	2.2627396075030513
Increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity.	2.633052329444269
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	1.9368997942315107
The origin of the high levels of procalcitonin in septic conditions is not fully understood.	2.492615483889718
Although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections, a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis.	2.110152269523107
More studies are needed to uncover the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule.	2.343177574151066
Fractures of the hand sceleton are common injuries.	2.4914649908618896
These are or are associated with phalangeal fractures.	2.5350975636932493
Kirschner wires can be used for osteosynthesis, but can cause lesions of periphereal finger structures.	2.526457568217454
The aim of our study was to record the incidence of lesions in peripherial structures of the fingers caused by retrograde crossed inserted Kirschner wires of 1.0, 1.25, 1.4 and 1.6 mm diameter into the middle and proximal phalanges of the long fingers and the proximal phalanx of the thumb of 120 fresh cadaver hands.	1.9936123527034506
We found an increase of insertion attempt frequency and an increasing number of lesions with increasing Kirschner wire diameter.	2.348849220357365
Because of these findings Kirschner wires of 1.0 or 1.25 mm diameter should be prefered to prevent the periphereal functional finger structures.	1.854045409350218
In both cases, activity of -L-fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible.	1.8620671155275657
DNA analysis revealed a nonsense mutation (G401X) in exon 7 of the fucosidase gene; this leads to a premature stop codon and C-terminal deletion of 61 amino acids from the protein.	1.925757765288971
Discussion: On account of the mutation a unique PFlMI restriction site is obliterated; this simplifies molecular diagnosis of the G401X mutation.	2.00441745394564
So far, the mutation G401X has not been found in any other population.	2.374391783868719
Both, severity and duration of hypoxia are crucial in determining wether irreversible cerebral infarction will occur or not.	2.073045613696475
For the clinical routine, the diagnosis of hypoxia is indirectly made by low CPP, low jugularvenous oxygen saturation (SjO2) or low tissue PO2.	2.0656568309912955
To minimize misleading false negative SjO2, the CT-Approach for the side of monitorig and calculation of arterial-jugularvenous lactate content for detection of anaerobic metabolism is recommended.	1.9103440073540228
Targeted treatment of hypoxia according to the underlying cause is mandatory.	2.716558110265031
Within the autoregulatory range decreasing CPP causes vasodilation and increasing CPP vasoconstriction with increasing or decreasing cerebral blood volume respectively.	1.8663817406831806
Targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension must avoid decreasing CPP.	2.2625703659152925
In the early postrautmatic phase prevention of cerebral hypoxia relies on management of CBF by means of CPP and cerebral vascular resistance.	2.0613104745485074
Thereafter targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension caused by cerebral edema and hypervolemia are increasingly important.	2.055413295585748
Today, orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end-stage of various liver diseases, and a 1-year survival rate of 80 % and a 5-year survival rate of 70 % in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys.	2.5401770408636373
The liver transplant programme of the Inselspital in Bern is small compared with international centres, which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme.	2.0386754068648063
Over a period of 66 months, 62 liver transplantations were performed in 60 patients at the Inselspital.	2.3291225537609024
The hospital mortality was 3.3 %, and the 2.5-year overall survival rate was 92 % for elective cases without tumor.	2.316285297821796
After a median follow-up of 30 months, 68 % of all patients were re-integrated in housework or full- or part-time in their profession, and 83 % were independent from the help of others.	2.14625719667555
We conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards.	1.9832951318537855
Accidental hypothermia (AH) can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below 35  °C during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic thermoregulatory dysfunction.	1.9046894550148286
Pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co-morbid factors such as trauma, submersion, intoxication and underlying diseases.	2.1145488317048917
In trauma victims stratified according to the Injury Severity Score, the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival.	2.3512287459351193
In these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible.	2.3500027082772514
In the Utrecht University Hospital, adult patients with AH are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions.	1.884757940669961
Patients with perfusing cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over 80 mmHg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR).	1.7666333422010052
Arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	2.138661656023541
Fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia.	2.9897843845281953
Twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm (CAVR n = 18, CPB n = 2) and two patients were alternatively managed.	2.630716721296114
Mortality in the CAVR group was 28 % and total mortality reached 32 %.	2.1088169002898884
Complications of CAVR are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation.	2.3727536062371763
CAVR permits a good access to the (trauma-) patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries.	2.169436179792882
The grading of long-tubular-bone pseudarthrosis depends on the biological reaction or lack of reaction in pseudarthrosis or non-unions.	2.3645889256265185
Hypertrophic and oligotrophic pseudarthrosis belongs to biologically reacting non-unions, whereas non-reacting non-unions are necrotic pseudarthrosis and defective non-unions with partial decline or complete destruction of cortical substance.	1.8171094066800906
Pseudarthrosis is a serious disturbance or disorder within the regulation cycle in fracture healing, which consists of osteoregeneration, osteovascularization and stabilization.	1.9467720619564846
The causes and underlying reasons for disturbance of this regulation cycle are primarily massive destruction of the biological and functional very important unity of periost, cortical substance and medullary space.	1.8966763371313464
This can occur from trauma, but it happens more often from surgical procedures that do not take the biological principles of bone-healing into account.	2.1689210408951745
Surgical strategies and interventions that respect the importance of periosteal tissue, cortical tissue and medullary space do fill the biological principles of fracture-healing and fracture union.	2.0046411622230513
Background: Clonidine, an 2-receptor agonist, has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics.	2.356188869688968
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of spinally injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics.	2.202614401623739
Differentiation of an elevated, repeatedly determined platelet count (>=500x109/l) includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic myeloprolifera-tive disorder (CMPD).	1.8943596160386353
In addition to clinical findings, the evolution of laboratory data during follow-up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact.	2.431849780140687
Characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis, but also by the myeloid stromal compartment.	2.45971466973609
While the megakaryocyte-rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the 5q- syndrome (MDS) are dominated by abnormal micromegakaryocytes, in polycythemia vera (PV) this cell lineage reveals a pleomorphous appearance.	1.8313257664475007
In essential thrombocythemia (ET), a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated (staghorn-like) nuclei may be encountered.	1.9755049117245829
A clear-cut discrimination of ET from early (hypercellular) stages of idiopathic (primary) myelofibrosis (IMF) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible, provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis characterizing the latter entity are taken into account.	1.676286548179084
Moreover, CML displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas PV shows a panmyelosis or trilineage proliferation, involving erythropoiesis, in particular.	1.9060542820251691
In contrast, erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in CML and to a lesser degree also in IMF.	2.07325185794855
Similar results are exhibited regarding reticulin fibrosis, which is usually not present in ET, rarely observed in PV and detectable to a variable degree in CML and IMF.	2.025414135703152
This benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia.	2.4190877294269693
We report the case of a 56-year-old patient who underwent breast biopsy, followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy.	2.403065467771002
Histological examination revealed solid cell aggregates as foreign tissue in the capsule of 1 of 11 identified lymph nodes devoid of any keratin immunoreaction.	1.8347519725645909
Strong immunohistological staining for the S-100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates.	2.5026997365980947
We report the case of a seven year old girl presenting with varicella infection 14 days after kidney transplantation.	2.093146603235594
Cramp-like abdominal pain and a subileus were the first symptoms.	2.4735590279948467
Enemas did not relieve the symptoms, and the following laparotomoy with Tenckhoff catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities.	2.229628753377977
Two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed.	2.497590045161957
Further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella-zoster virus was isolated from their fluid.	1.9303899685620145
Despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella-zoster immune globulin further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy.	1.7791527863403775
The patient died 18 days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure.	2.1385967426708525
The unconscious patient presents an challenging emergency in the intensive care unit.	2.0900062510935973
Patient evaluation and treatment must occur simultaneously.	2.4071734043598143
After checking vital signs, deciding about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation, an intravenous line must be established, blood samples collected and glucose and thiamine should be given.	1.892010607844034
The physical and neurological examination should be performed in a efficient way and must consider the following eight points: best reaction to loud commands, best motor reaction to noxious stimuli, respiratory pattern, size and reactions of pupils, eye movements, corneal and blink reflex, meningismus, muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes.	1.79867474848579
With this approach it is possible to formulate a working diagnosis, and the appropriate diagnostic steps can be performed.	2.629166252146733
A severe course of alcohol withdrawal has been observed in 28% of patients in a neurological intensive care unit due to complicating central nerve system (CNS) diseases.	2.282388843609967
In any atypical alcoholic delirium, especially with focal neurological signs, partial seizures, or decreased level of consciousness, CNS diseases like meningoencephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, or central pontine myelinolysis must be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tap.	1.8434531123851994
The diagnostic and prognostic value of CT scan and CSF analysis was examined in 32 persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens.	2.066645582296747
Neurological complications and cerebral convulsions at the beginning of delirium tremens appear to predispose the patient to a protracted clinical course and necessary mechanical ventilation.	2.184958235825175
Blood-CSF barrier permeability is increased in 70% of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course.	2.3274399059614277
Cerebral atrophy as shown in CT scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course.	2.1777871643233406
In our experience, CT examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium.	1.9666612084450457
One component of the device is the microphone for implantation into the posterior canal wall.	2.3047834517276757
The membrane of the microphone can be covered by skin, cartilage, or fascia, avoiding reduction in sound transmission at the same time.	1.9951700384062723
In the study presented here, the microphone was implanted into 50 cadaver specimens of human temporal bone.	2.02643112571659
Localization of the microphone was determined by the anatomical situation of the facial nerve.	2.802237174053586
The microphone and the piezoelectric transducer could be implanted in 78% of the temporal bones after total mastoidectomy.	2.1685486331484585
In the final version of the microphone, the size was 4.5 mm and total weight 400 mg.	2.1062900072270923
Collagen vascular diseases, representing systemic soft tissue disorders, may cause a broad spectrum of pathologic changes of the respiratory tract.	2.3445677076337326
The type and extent of manifestations can vary considerably among individuals and entities.	2.146791075064033
This survey describes the chest radiographic and, in particular, high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) findings of individual lesions of the respiratory tract.	2.488108365808458
It includes fibrosing alveolitis (alveolitis, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis) and bronchial (bronchitis/bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis), pleural and vascular manifestations, as well as lymphadenopathy and abnormalities related to therapy.	1.8497589722598864
We present typical patterns of changes in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, Sharp syndrome), Sjögren syndrome, overlap syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	1.8101535374409454
Furthermore, we describe findings which are specific for individual entities such as esophageal involvement in PSS, acute pneumonitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in SLE, lymphoproliferative disease in Sjögren syndrome and necrobiotic nodules in RA.	1.7526889890521713
The psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders, or "hysterical" symptoms are increasingly understood as ways of coping with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence such as abuse or violence.	2.064627458273349
Dissociation with induced depersonalisation, derealisation, and personification of objects as only good or only bad is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.	1.9098747891035166
Unassimilated memories of traumata have a retraumatizing effect and call for defence through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behaviour, or social acting-out.	1.8738204278695925
Against this psychodynamic background we describe a method of trauma-therapy which uses experiences of hypnotherapy and of Guided affective Imagery.	1.9449001519117712
In the preparatory phase a secure inner space and contact to inner helpers are established in the imagination using a resource-oriented approach.	1.9114707069245618
The actual trauma-therapy consists of a gradual leading-up to the traumatic scenes through consistent, minimally retraumatizing confrontation, followed by consolation and the ability to let go.	2.224842973923451
In the final phase there is a return to resource-oriented creativity and concrete life planning.	2.2020323416971723
All patients of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Erfurt Hospital with odontogenic pyogenic infections have been analyzed in a retrospective study over a period of 10 years, from 1987 to 1997.	2.2255093979262797
This included questions concerning frequency, seriousness and treatment of these infections, social changes in the environ prove effects about the referral behaviour and the course.	2.2887497986574497
Odontogenic pyogenic infections are mixed infections.	2.427310818570399
Aerobic agents such as hemolytic streptococcuses and staphylococcuses as well as anaerobic bacteria and  fungi can be involved.	2.286583210602692
Cephalosporine, aminobenzylpenicillin in combination with -lactamase inhibitor, alcylaminopenicillin and lincosamide are recommended based on analysis of infection resistance as first choice medications with carbapeneme as a reserve antibiotic.	1.8652830975168664
Hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector.	2.1115109557239324
If comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance profitability or efficiency, and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality, it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation summarizing performance and calculation and the hospital statistics (no.	1.8558788130480948
of cases, days of care, length of stay, case lump sums and special fees).	2.3804684043013777
Documentation of particular features of the patient population, the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level.	2.5562944168288255
With rising costs, the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service.	2.0656195347277837
Hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital's own situation with regard to performance, quality, efficiency and patient satisfaction, but can also provide a basis for structural planning.	2.20966150977386
The fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures, processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients, the doctors who refer them and the visitors.	2.166765845846203
If hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the invoicing data, it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level.	2.054768044810233
This would be bad for the patient and, in view of the consequent costs, also for the overall costs in the health care sector.	2.546091223777734
Against the backdrop of a future performance-related system of remuneration instead of the principle of covering one's own costs that has been in place hitherto, openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals.	1.7929784669001079
Laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 120 patients scheduled to undergo either radical perineal prostatectomy or radiation therapy.	2.3415853763492214
On average 13 lymph nodes were resected in each patient, and 21 patients were found to have metastatic disease in 1-9 lymph nodes.	2.251932453963451
After an initial learning curve, mean operative time was reduced significantly, allowing laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical prostatectomy to be performed as a one-stage procedure.	2.2547263534146627
The overall complication rate was 10 %; open revisions were necessary in only 2 of 120 patients.	2.2128643850240657
Postoperative hospital stay was 2 days in patients undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection only.	2.546331827957343
This minimally invasive procedure is particularly beneficial to patients with lymph node metastases not undergoing radical prostatectomy, as well as to patients planned to be treated by radiation therapy.	2.5724170459846283
The combination of laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical perineal prostatectomy avoids an abdominal incision and thus shortens both the hospital stay and the period of convalescence.	2.1280945556541297
Taking the concepts of psychic structure and internal representation as an example, three different ways of relating psychoanalytic concepts to neurobiology are presented and discussed: the localizing, the metaphorical and the modelling relation.	1.9332349013217287
The need is stressed not to mix up the different levels of description and explanation too early; at the same time it is argued that - after the dismissal of the old metapsychology - this way of relating offers a new chance to integrate neurobiological aspects in the concept of psychic structure without falling into the traps of biologistic reductionism and individualism.	1.7674237447231815
Following augmentation of the upper extremity muscles necessitated by damage to the brachial plexus, special post-operative care programs are required to provide the patient with the best possible results.	2.4476094738117955
Proper care requires cooperation between the orthopedic surgeon, physical therapists and nurses.	2.1655701498172273
Only then can postoperative rehabilitation and functional control of the extremity improve.	2.4760958723879765
We describe interdisciplinary postoperative care programs for augmentation of the deltoid muscle with trapezius transfer, arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint, biceps augmentation with the latissimus dorsi transfer, Steindler flexorplasty and augmentation of flexors/extensors muscles in the hand.	1.7253676875059298
The prevalence of type I allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire, prick tests and the determination of specific IgE antibodies.	2.186848627704368
When the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2% in the second semester to 10.4% in the tenth semester was seen.	2.135251245028977
A history of glove intolerance presenting as a wheal-and-flare reaction was associated with a type I allergy against latex in only 50% of the affected subjects.	2.2062611129552954
Atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in 16 and 5 of 18 students with latex allergy, respectively.	2.144427356245437
A high-ammonia accelerator-free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific IgE antibodies to latex.	2.1838092203626456
Gastrointestinal obstruction is a frequently observed emergency with tumor patients.	2.298804498102055
In addition to tumor relapse, the development of a second tumor or intraperitoneal tumor spreading, and benign alterations in advanced tumor stages (radiogenic stenosis, adhesions) may also be the cause for the obstruction.	2.149024598311386
The main objective of therapy is an attempt to eliminate the intestinal obstruction through surgery.	2.3705669285365225
If this is not possible because of advanced intra-abdominal tumor expansion, several endoscopic or interventional radiology methods, and drugs are available, that are used on an individual basis and based on prevailing experience to relieve the patient's condition.	2.0054657131526845
The case of a 60-year-old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma (T3N2CM0) and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented.	2.276711954015138
On one side, the sacculus opened atypically into the left vestibular fold.	2.0622544148789594
The sacculus is a physiologic part of the roof of Morgagni's ventricle, the size of which can vary greatly.	2.4452165859770867
These canal-like structures can be the point of origin of cysts, laryngoceles, mucoceles, and pyoceles.	1.9556235567693157
Adverse effects of resuscitation due to closed-chest cardiac massage are common, and the incidence is increased when an incorrect technique is used.	2.2749610911631475
Nevertheless, thrombolytic therapy of a myocardial infarction can become necessary even after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).	2.144862107117769
In these patients, the risk of thrombolytic therapy-induced bleeding is immanent.	3.3063653515808458
Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD) have led to a reduction in cardiac mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	3.0207972643407426
A considerable number of patients experience repeated shocks which may have an impact on the quality of life.	2.5404003493767857
An overview of the 30 years history and developement of documentation and information systems in the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is presented.	1.9381085532559121
Since the foundation in 1967 four developmental phases can be described: first initiatives of medical doctors, establishment of a basic documentation system for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning and realisation of information systems with the possibility of controlling in medical areas and thereby steering of the services.	1.8453753286012164
Planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the masterplans and concepts of the university clinics of the state of Baden-Württemberg.	2.020618447797113
The treatment success of nCPAP therapy (nasal continuous positive airway pressure) depends partly on the relief of symptoms and partly on long-term patient acceptance and the related avoidance of complications.Nasal complaints constitute the most frequently reported side effects and, together with problems of mask application, are among the primary factors causing an nCPAP-therapy to be prematurely discontinued.	1.987275999278177
The foramen ovale is anatomically open in 25 % of individuals, but functionally closed by the higher pressure in the left antrum.	2.1424691945524765
Right-to-left shunt and subsequent paradoxical embolism may occur when pressure in the left antrum rises, for example, as a result of pulmonary embolism.	2.53107149836834
In the present case we demonstrate a patient who presented 20 days after osteosynthetic treatment of a femoral fracture with word-finding deficits.	2.1414486237905233
Cerebral MRT revealed a fresh ischemic insult.	2.4167863736717545
Duplex ultrasound of the legs showed a fresh thrombosis of the superficial femoral vein and scintigraphy of the lungs detected pulmonary embolism.	2.2313750973011968
Transesophageal contrast echocardiography trapped a hemodynamically spontaneous, open foramen ovale.	2.0404312773870523
Duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries detected no pathological findings.	2.251398833181043
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can be clinically unconspicuous and become manifest by cerebral deficits resulting from paradox embolism and cerebral ischemia.	1.9153100195488122
The diagnostic strategies in multiple trauma aim at rapid identification of life-threatening injuries, recognition of serious organ lesions, and evaluation of the systemic trauma impact, as well as the resulting host reaction.	2.2493878821873206
Besides improvements in the structure and organization, major innovations in imaging techniques have significantly improved and accelerated evaluation of the patient with multiple injuries in the emergency room.	2.634310506510754
Systematic diagnostic work-up, integrated multidisciplinary approach, and defined algorithms for traumatic key symptoms represent the hallmarks of successful emergency room management.	2.0798402074547653
In particular, diagnostic work-up of injured body cavities using sonography and helical computed tomography are evaluated.	2.1553980604715375
Pheochromocytomas are functionally active, catecholamine-secreting tumours of chromaffin tissue.	2.0390042149291414
This drug irreversibly alkylates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them nonfunctional, thereby causing vasodilatation.	1.9595799974453871
The duration of action of a single dose is approximately 24 h. Therefore, postoperative hypotension is a hazard of therapy with phenoxybenzamine if adequate plasma volume repletion is not provided.	1.9885532362546292
Prazosin, a short-acting, competitive alpha-1 blocker, has been used preoperatively, but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes.	2.3015118187561296
Case report: Case presentation of a 59-year old female patient, who has been treated for her cancer by a physician of internal medicine with peroxodisulphuric acid.	2.202898678115294
For this therapy to be successful - according to the physician - all drugs especially the analgetics had to be stopped.	2.5868676161806214
We present a case of primary plasmocytoma of the left upper bronchus.	2.5386700076853286
Occlusion led to atelectasis of the left upper lobe and subsequent poststenotic pneumonia.	2.4964741362098346
Therapy consisted of local excision of the bronchus and postoperative radiotherapy.	2.542807294502422
This type of lung-conserving therapy in a case of primary plasmocytoma has not been described before.	2.630281527822738
545 male patients with a tentative diagnosis "urethritis" were examined between November 1984 and December 1994 in the Department of Dermatology and Venerology of the Military Hospital in Ulm.	2.122780735176477
The patients, aged from 18 to 58 years (mean age 24.1 years), were examined according to a standardized diagnostic procedure: ...	2.38795110649294
The use of the Kaufman-Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) was evaluated with a sample of 50 mentally disabled adults in a wide age range, as there exist no special tests for this group of patients.	2.0097002245936677
Intercorrelation- and factor analyses, and correlations with the German adaptation of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (HAWIE-R) proved the use of the K-ABC to be valid.	2.1565466624748706
As an assessment battery for children designed for the wide age range from 2-6 to 12-5 years is more adequate to the capability of intellectually impaired adults, the K-ABC delivers results on individual strengths and weaknesses, based on a neuropsychological theory.	1.9303612631556664
Thus the individual cognitive abilities can be assessed with more differentiation, and that gives an important base for intervention, partial remediation, and placement.	1.9469985961747394
Subject: Using multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) large body areas can scanned with high spatial resolution.	2.0134031564782604
In this study, MSCT was employed for virtual colonoscopy in various pathologies of the colon.	2.0320299056294733
In a regional quality assurance project for screening mammography (German Mammography Study), 27 335 women were screened in 40 participating, office-based mammography units from 1990-1992.	1.7294179725371028
Screening led to 317 biopsies with a positive predictive value of 0.33.	2.381504699508782
All biopsy documentation available to the mammography physicians was analysed with a view towards biopsy interval and completeness of information fed back to the Mx physicians.	1.9100553071406334
Biopsy recommendations were acted upon in 29 % of cases within 2 weeks.	2.115324096949469
With the exception of the dignity Mx physicians were incompletely informed about biopsy results.	1.899559504532373
The surgical procedure was known in the doctors' offices in 62 % of the cases.	2.214694028097706
Specimen radiographies were not done regularly.	2.468322117999082
A pathology report was available overall in 42 of 106 malignant cases, respectively.	2.002907803227188
With the exception of the histological diagnosis itself, no variable mentioned in the reports was documented completely.	2.130120240810459
Only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely.	2.574274175052277
Fail-safe information are requested by Mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations.	1.9499350392016614
A (regional) quality assurance center should be made responsible to analyse the flow of information in mammography screening, to fill in gaps and to speed up professional cooperation.	1.9728130263642611
The high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment.	2.6170588286527225
In a 13-year period, 52 out of 95 patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively.	2.073649624972393
The was being left in situ on an average of 6.6 days.	2.456989434515748
After an observation period of at least 36 months a recurrence was seen in 2 of these 52 patients (3.9 %; causes: volvulus after 6 months/fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day).	2.060673760351916
Amongst the 43 'non-splinted' patients, recurrence of adhesive obstruction was documented in 8 cases (18.6 %; causes: adhesions after 0.3-136.9 months).	1.8421313687390057
In the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted.	2.46309409171009
Complications concerning the nasointestinal tubes did not occur.	2.2257129589214695
The rate of perioperative complications was similar in both groups.	2.2423265171005764
Minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been developed to offer patients the benefits of open heart operations with decreased pain and limited skin incision.	2.2343952280634367
From May 1996 to January 1998, 86 patients received isolated aortic valve replacement by the limited superior median sternotomy (group 1).	2.098169346302572
As a control group (group 2), 78 patients were enrolled who underwent isolated aortic valve replacements by standard sternotomy in the same period.	2.3865860171035185
AV-synchrony and rate-responsive pacing are known as major factors to increase the maximum working capacity in patients with chronotropic incompetence.	2.3251414921659594
However, their importance throughout low-levels of exercise is poorly evaluated.	2.0947754756393886
We studied 11 patients with implanted dual-chamber pacemakers (Telectronics, META 1254) concerning oxygen uptake kinetics during serial treadmill exercise testing at a constant workload of 35 W (LITE protocol).	1.7516026289930149
Each patient was tested in VVIR-, DDD-, and DDDR-mode.	2.335942327389636
All AV delays were constant at 160ms.	2.2691773694933435
The oxygen deficit (O2D), mean response time (MRT) for oxygen uptake, and a oxygen deficit index (O2Di) were determined.	2.1480156304726217
In addition, the heart rate (HR) and bloodpressure were monitored.	2.090389284516719
Comparing the randomly synchronous VVIR- to the DDDR-mode, only the MRT of oxygen uptake demonstrated a significant decrease in the DDDR-mode (p<0.05).	2.075231779241199
There were also significant decreases in O2Di and MRT in the DDDR-mode, as compared to the non-rate responsive DDD-mode (p<0.01).	2.1679811268699303
Stress testing in PM patients with an appropriate chronotropic response to low intensity exercise demontrates that AV synchrony is of much less influence on oxygen uptake kinetics than the rate-adaptive pacing.	1.8851541611363156
Purpose: This paper discusses the role of different imaging modalities in the diagnostic work-up of Crohn's disease (CD).	2.6744714961392755
Introduction: Results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non-cemented prostheses can, at the very least temporarily, be impaired by the application of non-steroidal antiphlogistic agents (such as diclofenac).	2.2802114458815623
It is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages (3 times 50 mg daily) on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses.	2.10075406182701
Methods: To investigate this, cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications.	1.983253184836077
Our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines.	2.2382275957385813
The measurable maximal plasma concentration 2h after the application of one tablet Voltaren 50 reached 1.6µg/ml.	2.122673311320677
This correlated with diclofenac concentrations between 1 and 10 ml found in our experiments.	2.157186661335979
The detected values were correlated to the control group (0 µg/ml diclofenac).	2.5084136336693783
Results: The drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells.	2.119110227226268
The proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells, compared to untreated cells, was found to be decreased.	2.467482247631014
We observed a decrease to 82% at a diclofenac concentration of 1 µg/ml, Osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to 97,5% at the same concentration.	2.159755788199158
The DNA synthesis increased to 118% in stromal bone marrow cells, in osteoblasts to 144%.	1.9831052308467985
In contrast, we detected a neglectible decrease to 92% in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells.	1.902176212659785
The synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to 119%.	2.1019383473298663
The alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to 88% in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to 111%.	2.1231131628638393
Conclusion: Temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non-cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism, exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression.	2.1852296214844777
Osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the osteoneogenesis is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition.	2.035077569139897
Recent investigations have controversially but convincingly interpreted the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis).	2.2100816436643203
Atherosclerosis can apparently be the result of ultrachronic, persistent infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae and not the result of heterogenous risk factors.	2.2306885732619697
The main arguments for chlamydial genesis are: Correlation of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic diseases and antibodies against Chlamydia pneumoniae.	2.015442390233922
(2) Chlamydia pneumoniae could be detected with different techniques (PCR, ICC, immunhistology, electromicroscopy, culture) in a high percentage of atheromas from different sites.	2.1147123606241216
(3) According to three successful international studies with macrolides in coronary heart disease.	2.1481623254684874
(4) Target cells of atherosclerosis (endothelia, macrophages, muscle cells) can be infected by Chlamydia pneumoniae in vitro.	2.2291731326964688
(5) Provocation of arteriitis in animal experiments.	2.4565782018440174
(6) The reduction of incidence of atherosclerotic diseases since the 1960s, probably due to advances in antibiotic treatment.	2.161704215871049
(7) Elevated levels of acute-phase proteins and other inflammatory signs (CRP, WBC count, fibrinogin) briefly before cardiac infarction occurs.	1.9277128591688564
There are good arguments for intervention studies in coronary heart disease and other manifestations of atherosclerosis.	2.2068512872560664
The relevant antibiotics are available for chlamydial infections and are inexpensive and safe.	2.278814258832294
Meticulous protocols and long-term monitoring of patients should be developed.	2.921603378337982
The pre- and postoperative symptoms of zygomatic bone fractures were examined in a follow-up study to prepare a classification proposal.	2.5535720331458736
A differential indication for minimally invasive therapy modes was looked for with respect to this proposal.	2.3793973981155983
Therapy of isolated zygomatic bone fractures consisted in repositioning with a hook and miniplate fixation across the frontozygomatic suture.	1.8620936020106231
The aims of this study were clinical and radiological assessment of the repositioning result in terms of aesthetics and stability and quantification of the postoperative remission of disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	2.521288814710113
A total of 52 patients were examined.	2.789981904028391
After the operation (on average after 3.5 days following the trauma) they were followed-up postoperatively for 12 months according to a strict schedule.	2.1003176295142363
Preoperatively, 49 patients reported disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	2.137152461840514
Other symptoms, such as periorbital haematoma and flattening of the zygomatic prominence, were observed in 49 patients and 45 patients, respectively.	2.3022504089853153
All fractures were repositioned well as assessed clinically and radiologically.	2.263485886239898
The aesthetic result was evaluated as symmetric and durable in all cases.	2.2355250313484643
Six months postoperatively 41 patients reported normal sensitivity in the area of the infraorbital nerve.	2.199840494740214
In only five patients (10.2%) was the sensitivity loss persistent throughout the entire follow-up period.	2.160347036523963
Patients with primarily lacking diplopia developed neither eye motility disturbances nor postoperative enophthalmus in the following period.	1.9677123656672153
It can be concluded that the treatment of an isolated zygomatic bone fracture which satisfies aesthetic and functional requirements is possible by reposition and fixation with one miniplate at the lateral orbital rim.	2.1666035365587892
An additional osteosynthesis at the infraorbital rim or at the zygomaticomaxillary crista is not necessary.	2.0552374422623436
A routine revision of the orbital floor is only indicated in cases of preoperative diplopia.	2.5842635391912077
A zygomatic bone fracture connected with diplopia should be classified as combined zygomatic-/orbital floor fracture.	2.03515169227569
To date, this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life.	2.3242534005749795
Headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the German language.	2.7071925545051903
In America, a headache specific questionnaire, the "Headache Disability Inventory" (HDI), has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a German version, the "Inventar zur Beeinträchtigung durch Kopfschmerzen" (IBK).	2.0511910037200947
94 consecutive patients with a primary headache disorder (59 female, 35 male; mean age 40 +/- 12 years) were examined.	2.656101831885562
Cronbach's alpha was a=0.90, the test-retest-reliability after three months was r=0.87.	1.973655116338912
An analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test-retest-reliability of these subscales.	1.8782893766301683
The scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly.	2.7398121960791704
In post-hoc-analyses, however, cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales.	2.3195798009480932
The total score of the IBK was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month (r=0.41; p<0.0003) but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters.	2.1925208312102282
The IBK is the first German headache specific measurement of certain aspects of the quality of life in chronic headache patients.	2.6836877697172126
It can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies.	3.3200822596586543
Age and menstrual cycle have an important influence on the breast.	2.69002611567784
This well-known fact is experienced in the daily routine of gynecologists and radiologists.	2.312902865971027
The number of publications addressing the effect of these influences on imaging, however, is surprisingly low.	2.449150686616428
The aim of this work is to describe the influences of age and menstrual cycle on the breast and to address their clinical relevance for mammography and MR mammography.	2.0154921904898835
Therefore, own data are presented concerning the age and menstrual cycle influences on breast parenchyma in dynamic MR mammography.	2.003089850127511
Literature data are used to correlate mammography and MR imaging findings with these influences.	2.48684745872719
The changes of the breast due to age and menstrual cycle have important direct implications on performing and reading conventional mammography and MR mammography.	2.0856570939951085
The knowledge of these changes is also helpful in the interpretation of findings when comparing different methods.	2.2563134846517516
Finally, the data gained by using imaging methods enable important basic insights into physiology and physiopathology of the breast in vivo.	2.021308019417464
As part of our neonatal screening program we applied tandem mass spectrometry on 128.225 dried blood samples for detection of inborn errors of metabolism.	1.8262094353666112
Appendectomy is one of the most frequent surgical procedures.	2.8440250528963977
The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, therefore, can only be definitely confirmed by pathomorphological analysis, the criteria of which are reviewed in this paper.	2.5671858042223152
Special emphasis is given to distinct variants of acute appendicitis and the significance of neuroappendicopathy.	2.2960702469607353
Extra-articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint (genu varum or valgum) are treatments proven over many years.	2.006891222741643
The middle and long term results shows many patients are very satisfied.	2.3582645787662617
Unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores.	2.036865031915768
The good results by infra- and supracondylar osteotomies - some of them for 15 years and more - have to be achieved by prosthesis first.	2.2730234810645555
The important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning, the miss load, and the instability of the joint; these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency.	2.3190564013054287
Therefore, indication of infra- or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient.	2.248743606467377
The most important fact is the condition of the joint, especially the quality of bone, the instability of the joint, and the loss of bone.	3.1952510953925906
Given the right indication, the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint.	2.430938155603856
Also, there are still chances to do another operation, such a prothesis.	2.4417240392442827
A prothesis can be implanted if the osteotomy has no chance to preserve the joint.	2.130741839792255
Psychic trauma may be followed by a variety of unpredictable reactions by the subject, which differ individually and are dependant upon the situation.	2.2770161596733995
This article aims to overview the different psychic and psychiatric disturbances which are relevant in preclinical emergency medicine.	1.9347947725387962
A definition is offered to outline PES that require immediate medical intervention and crises due to psycho-social reasons.	1.8833528763045975
For the most important disturbances and syndromes the differential diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies are presented.	2.739031615820293
Acute pancreatitis is a multietiologic entity with rather diverse clinical courses.	2.1092395902601253
Whereas edematous pancreatitis has a mortality of less than 1%, nowadays; still approximately 20% of all patients with the necrotizing form succumb to the disease.	2.5087461590914337
To further improve therapeutic results a standardized approach should be used.	2.460626277665949
For effective treatment the differentiation between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis is crucial.	2.246317545888339
All patients with signs of pancreatic necroses during abdominal ultrasound and patients with organ insufficiencies should undergo a CT-scan to define exactly the nature and the extent of the disease.	2.1314977544652978
Primarily all patients are treated conservatively.	2.978876452119064
Main indications for operative intervention are signs for infection of pancreatic necroses and an acute abdomen due to local complications of acute pancreatitis.	2.145114379203465
In cases of biliary origin an elective cholecystectomy has to be performed during a free interval to prevent a recurrence.	2.300335004284884
Objective: Diagnosis of osteomyelitis is difficult in early state of disease.	2.3256026302573964
Usually, characteristic X-ray findings cannot be obtained during the first week of disease.	2.7372985333292843
Sonography, scintigraphy and magnetic resonance tomography were compared at clinical manifestation of osteomyelitis.	2.4153415756373304
A 73-year old female patient is known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) since 1989.	2.457002487521853
After a transmural anterolateral myocardial infarction with the development of a large apical aneurysma of the anterior wall, a previously measured gradient of 11 mm Hg in the LVOT is no longer detected.	2.2842884197294446
As a consequence of this casuistry, "pseudo-myectomy" caused by myocardial as an example of an uncommon spontaneous course of HOCM.	1.959316613818408
Aim: Intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes Type I.	2.902476047145501
Intensified insulin therapy includes an basis-bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, several times daily blood glucose self-monitoring, self-adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far-reaching liberalization of nutrition.	1.7875423046058578
The patients learn selfmanagement of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program.	2.127068210792455
The effectivity of this program is evaluated in the routine care.	2.464621231806589
Curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity, vertebral rotation, rigidity of the curve, the skeletal age, the age and sex of the patient, the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve.	2.3398547897482427
In scoliosis over 40  ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period.	2.0248335236652784
Progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major scolioses, especially in young patients (Risser sign 0 and 1).	2.3330679115990822
The purpose of this study was to evaluate low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist.	2.3459772828912158
Between August 1995 and May 1997, 75 patients at the Unfallchirurgische Universitätsklinik, Mainz, Germany, with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination, X-ray and MRI imaging.	2.4262809629956306
MRI analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying MRI experience without knowledge of the patient's history.	2.581055894289914
The sensitivity and specifity of the more [U1] and the less experienced [U2] radiologist ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 61 to 100% (U2).	1.947989244695363
Positive and negative predictive value ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 58 to 100% (U2); accuracy ranged from 92 to 100% (U1) and from 77 to 100% (U1).	1.7948392015352104
We conclude that the results of low-field MRI are comparable with those of high-field MRI and that differences in the results of the experienced and less experienced radiologist can be established.	2.78689354832203
In intervention trials it was without exception possible to influence the development of atherosclerosis by a reduction of the LDL-cholesterol and an increase in HDL-cholesterol and to reduce complications like myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, angina or heart failure.	2.429856530790715
Changes of lifestyle can be effective, but are rarely accepted and are difficult to communicate.	2.2288261302588217
Dermatosurgery has been gaining in importance in recent years.	2.2729077429064355
In departments of dermatology German-speaking countries the total number of operations increased by 58% from 1984 to 1991.	2.1633735595323835
Out-patient dermatosurgery was also performed mainly by dermatologists as opposed to other specialties.	2.022750959553348
From 1988 to 1992 dermatologists in private practice recorded an increase of 40.6% in the number of operative procedures they performed.	2.425975981793449
The importance of dermatosurgery in hospital and private practice can be expected to continue increasing in the future; dermatologists must therefore prepare themselves for the present and future challenges inherent in surgery of the skin.	2.144523712887873
There is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance.	2.178324813029465
Intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enables Doppler measurement of mitral inflow pattern (E/A ratio).	1.9000942546782558
The E/A ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation.	2.3397659644231092
In the present study we compared the time course of the E/A ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation () assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	2.0788243462164018
After ethical approval, 12 patients undergoing CABG surgery were studied.	2.2982446915084256
Measurements of the E/A ratio and  were performed after induction of anesthesia (I), immediately prior to CPB with the pericardium open (II), 5 min after CPB (III), and after sternal closure (IV).	2.2387818044373233
Time constant of myocardial relaxation was calculated as the reciprocal value of the slope of the left ventricular dP/dt and left ventricular pressure plot.	2.2780513932957867
The E/A ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery (IV).	2.305844048076665
In contrast,  was increased immediately after CPB, but decreased after sternal closure (IV).	1.8900893395991496
The results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after CPB, as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation.	2.339971169397664
However,  improved rapidly to pre-CPB values.	2.295168825242612
The E/A ratio alone failed to detect the initial post-CPB alteration in left ventricular relaxation.	1.9462798004632222
Acute exercise is followed by a mobilization of white blood cells, mainly induced by increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol.	2.0873181367304743
NK-cells react the most intensive, they can increase fivefold after intensive exercise.	2.0921232422673945
Additionally a weak acute-phase reaction occurs.	2.325630348749047
Most of these changes normalize during twenty-four hours.	2.1853567196113586
Parameters of the humoral immune system may be different from the pre-exercise levels up to seventy-two hours.	2.1452721435590614
Repeated physical exercise, which is typical for sports, is followed only by small changes of immunologic parameters under conditions of rest.	2.1903744807841976
Epidemiological studies give clues that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes can be described by a j-shaped curve.	2.216053343270317
Moderately active subjects have the lowest rate of infection.	2.3749423282200146
For this influence of exercise on health mainly functional changes seem to be important.	2.360475841062947
Especially after exccentric exercise immunological cells can be seen in the muscle tissue, which remove destructed tissue.	2.2518194760841066
Not very much is known about the role of the immune system in the regeneration of tendons and other bradytrophic tissues.	2.4438518314493796
To achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of attaining a straight and solid septum, even in cases of marked deviations or severe post-traumatic deformities, we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a "compound graft".	2.11718744708414
For this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed, and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are reconnected to each other to form a straight and solid plate.	1.9843484710342874
As connecting material we use a polydioxanon (PDS) foil.	2.11148870197402
The sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with PDS suture material.	2.012919266895906
The compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose.	2.010393652117983
The PDS and suture material are usually resorbed within 8 months, excluding long-term complications.	2.24096149475868
During the past 2 years this method was used in treating 38 patients.	2.320411268250548
The surgical goal was attained in every case, and no immediate or long-term complications occurred.	2.471149310401733
This method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better, significant correction of even severe septal deviations.	2.117305883826773
Two types of corticosteroid receptors have been identified in the brain and pituitary that play an important role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	2.0321053906439888
Evidently, a tight control of the concentration and function of these receptors is of prime importance for maintaining and regaining homeostasis after stressful challenges.	2.093300225990244
Here, we describe a novel mechanism revealing a rapid upsurge in MR density in the hippocampus (a limbic structure highly involved in HPA axis regulation) after an acute psychologically stressful challenge.	1.796981172182021
This rise in MR is accompanied by a stronger MR-mediated inhibitory control of the HPA axis.	2.3426653557275237
Thus, an acute stressful experience results in a reorganization of the HPA axis involving a principal role of the hippocampal MR.	2.1080427196385334
This novel mechanism may be of significance for increasing our understanding of the etiology of stress-related disorders.	2.4846492948038557
The wide variety of therapeutic effects make neuroleptics potent drugs in the treatment of pain.	2.650510274846898
Until now there has been no proof of their analgesic potency; in spite of this fact, neuroleptics are used to treat chronic pain states on the assumption that they do have analgesic potency.	2.3206888077847565
A metaanalysis was performed and 48 publications reviewed.	2.564521701098477
Thirty-four, the majority of the studies, are case reports, retrospective analyses or non-randomised cohort studies.	2.423311663298306
Most of these reports attest to a positive effect.	2.3575580282839534
However, only ten out of fifteen studies with a higher statistical study power describe a possible analgesic effect.	1.9661482974566844
None of the studies could differentiate between the effects of analgesia and sedation of the drugs used.	2.3855982005276966
The metaanalysis provides no evidence of intrinsic analgesic properties of neuroleptics for their use as adjuvant analgesics.	2.074004054158988
Studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimised when early signs of stroke are recognised and treatment is initiated within 3 hours from symptom onset.	2.0484632133387017
For most patients there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.	2.724919895535399
Many factors are responsible for this time delay: signs and symptoms often go unrecognised by patients, relatives and bystanders and stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff.	1.978990940426266
Although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window, this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education.	2.0183277016743033
For the future, we hope that emergency medical services (EMS) will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke.	2.0545261378399537
Standard of care by the EMS personnel includes maintenance of oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension as well as hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.	2.369529692221848
Early notification by the emergency medical services about stroke patients would enable stroke teams to be present at admission, thus improving the likelihood of a better outcome for patients.	2.0318042871530753
A decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or "wrapping" may lead to a partial loss of the arterial Windkessel-function.	2.32966075544455
The following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance.	2.444516853954065
In 8 pigs, the wall of the ascending aorta was wrapped with a prosthesis.	2.392853192864873
This approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta, like extracorporal circulation, cardioplegia or blood loss.	2.041849270739615
Flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention, and following Fourier Transformation, the aortic input impedance was calculated.	2.2214044936959767
Mean pressure, mean flow, and total peripheral resistance were unaltered, while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the "wrapping" procedure.	2.159248368637186
Thus, it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load.	2.536019717243681
Cervical lymphadenopathies are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology.	2.3924429860213583
There are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists.	2.528984819413338
To gain further information it is advisable to perform sonographically controlled fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNP).	1.933668166162399
We report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis X in lymph nodes.	2.176247533594226
A 63-year-old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about 6 weeks previously.	2.605278305238136
The preliminary examinations (FNP/blood examinations) revealed no pathological findings.	2.003377788630606
Only the histological examination delivered the diagnosis of histiocytosis X.	2.7410504538981026
The report demonstrates how to diagnose and treat this rare disease.	2.2025017470424766
We report our preliminary results using a new magnetic resonance imaging technique for visualization of the urinary tract.	2.583400535337005
Using the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), we were able to obtain images of the urinary tract comparable to those obtained by conventional excretory urography.	2.018053342687342
The major advantage of our technique is that besides good morphologic visualization, the excretion of gadolinium-DTPA can be studied simultaneously.	1.8985655551603247
We demonstrate our preliminary results in selected cases.	2.4128108878354704
Microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all cancellous bones by means of suitable preparation techniques.	2.3324452801905236
Histologically, these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local overloaded parts of the trabeculae.	2.0551982456394073
Using a preparation technique that allows combined two- and threedimensional analysis, 26 normal human spines and 11 osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus.	1.8110685181035555
Microcallus formations occur frequently in people over 45 years of age.	2.1231344340133775
They are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males.	2.281596546585734
The number of microcallus formations depends more on the microarchitecture of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters.	1.8176728843836516
In about 33 % of cases microfractures are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation.	2.1096999012698943
In noninvasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus.	2.0941561544016345
Although it indicates instability of the bone structure, microcallus formation is not a purely negative mechanism.	2.537539933152315
It stabilizes and regenerates the bone tissue.	2.3170284748518855
Furthermore, complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae.	1.8607897408966596
Osteoporosis is not the result of an inability to form microcallus.	2.687809298418936
DNA cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis.	2.1961266315392183
Solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have DNA-diploid cell populations.	2.276876109010848
Low-grade central osteosarcomas may show single-cell aneuploidies of varying extent as well as a DNA-diploid stemline.	2.3107457573806
Their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a DNA-aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation.	2.0519755710172376
Although noise in general can induce hearing loss, environmental noise represents an important risk for children, teenagers and young adults.	2.1569363177858727
Epidemiological investigations now support the occurrence of an increasing number of irreversible hearing losses in these groups.	2.4342725391522118
Major causes of hearing loss are toys (guns), explosives and electroacoustically amplified music delivered by head sets or heard in discotheques and open air concerts.	1.7303075165001167
The development of arthroscopic wrist surgery has helped to understand the anatomy and pathology of the wrist joint.	2.2087701438371434
One of the most important functions of the arthroscopic inspection in the radiocarpal and mediocarpal joints is the evaluation of the wrist stability.	2.6180526630861922
The arthroscopy of the wrist offers significant information independent from the standard radiological diagnostic tools.	2.336228986002336
TFCC lesions and scapholunate dissociation remain to be the most common causes for arthroscopic wrist surgery.	2.732432478358729
Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a consequence of vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency and in the majority of cases due to alcoholism.	2.5670737477419197
We report here the case of a 26-year-old male alcoholic who had stayed helplessly at home for 4 days until hospital admission.	2.2613715218866806
Clinical diagnosis was difficult due to major disturbance of consciousness.	2.2455975404435375
MRI showed an increase in signal intensity (T2-, FLAIR-weighted) around the third ventricle, the quadrigeminal bodies, the fornices, the mamillary bodies, the floor of the fourth ventricle and around the aqueduct.	1.9102353503749616
These findings were indicative of WE although of unusual extent.	2.069002859170378
In this case MRI correlated well with clinical symptomatology.	2.1684368317147333
Therapy with thiamine was started immediately and symptoms as well as MRI findings resolved partially.	2.5784496194163298
The presented case illustrates the diagnostic usefulness of MRI in WE especially if the patient is of reduced consciousness and clinical investigation is limited.	2.2032533653860438
Background: SLO microperimetric examination after the extraction of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) shows absolute scotoma in the area of pigment epithelial loss.	1.876202686227326
Laser treatment also causes complete functional loss.	2.2708668834081585
The functional results of these two methods should be compared before the surgical procedure is expanded.	2.70676774220701
Three case reports of a pseudomeniscus and an angiomatoid vascular proliferation of the synovial membrane as rare aseptic complications of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty are presented.	1.9917833364317215
Neither complication can be confirmed by clinical examination, laboratory findings or diagnostic imaging techniques.	2.498804269668395
Arthroscopy of the knee joint permits both diagnostic evaluation and low-risk surgical treatment.	2.534803854844812
Strabismus surgery in children is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).	2.7778337503084845
We report on a case of a 23 years old man who was polytraumatized in a car accident.	2.3018896024727438
He survived with excellent clinical outcome, but after 113 days after the accident he collapsed, massive bleeding out of the mouths started and the patient died within a few minutes.	2.324355923326883
A gastric ulcer bleeding was assumed, but autopsy showed the beak-in of a posttraumatic aortic aneurysm into the esophagus.	1.8837752061423743
The difficulties of in time diagnosis of thoracic aorta lesions are discussed.	2.125684668225479
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral leukoplakia (OL) in HIV-positive patients and to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features and the presence of Candida hyphae and viral infections (HSV 1, 2, HPV, EBV and CMV) by immunocytochemical methods using mono- or polyclonal antibodies.	2.134051178803329
A total of 269 HIV-seropositive patients, (222 men, median age 36.7 years and 47 women, median age 32 years) were registered.	2.001783045528877
OL occurred in 20/269 (7.4%) patients (men, smokers, median age 38 years); the non-homogeneous form was observed in 11%.	2.283495599719256
A lesional biopsy specimen was obtained from 8/20 patients.	2.246285897124725
Specimens did not show signs of epithelial dysplasia.	2.622217529241695
Candida hyphae were evident in 2/8 cases.	2.486693822825499
Two patients tested positive for HPV and CMV; antibodies against EBV, HSV1 and 2 were negative.	1.8910913396327649
In conclusion, the prevalence of OL is comparatively high in this group of HIV-seropositive patients (7.4% vs. 0.9-2.2%).	2.1626075867178014
Moreover, the mean age of the study group at the time of diagnosis for oL was lower (38 years vs. 60 years).	2.6879006067724
Damage/dysfunctioning of the heart forms part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in sepsis and SIRS.	2.3961364573073056
This potentially reversible cardiomyopathy is characterized by a considerable pump failure, not primarily ischemic, with coronary blood flow being normal or even enhanced; the left and right ventricle is enlarged as a consequence of an increased ventricular compliance.	1.9753258600117125
Damage of the heart can further be aggravated in case of additional right ventricular impairment due to pulmonary hypertension in ARDS.	2.289545258415459
SIRS-cardiomyopathy in non-infectious MODS has common traits with acute septic cardiomyopathy.	2.28668499002749
The pathogenesis of heart disease in sepsis and SIRS is multifactorial, the endotoxin/TNF/NO/ cGMP-cascade representing a main negative inotropic axis.	1.7780219874384646
Intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis should reduce the high incidence of soft tissue and ankle problems and should be an alternative to open plate fixation, with good ultimate functional outcome.	2.366743937047942
Between January 1993 and December 1995, a prospective study on 49 patients with distal metaphyseal tibia fracture and involvement of the ankle was performed.	2.394512589331323
All the fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis, and plate fixation in cases of fibula fractures.	2.511253455220983
There were 27 men and 22 women with an average age of 46.4  +/-  12.7 years (range 21-90).	2.0630420718889377
In most studies of the use of intramedullary nailing in distal tibial fractures the classification has been inadequate.	2.334669602547761
Therefore a new classification according to Robinson et al.	2.2293256673369366
(1995) was used: 10 fractures were type II B (20.4 %), 13 were type II C (26.5 %), and 26 patients suffered a combination of type II B and type II C (53.1 %).	2.1874995012489316
This fracture type was defined as type II D for use in this study.	2.3622776683825593
The severity of soft tissue injury was recorded using the Gustilo system in case of open (n = 19) and the Tscherne system in case of closed fractures (n = 30).	2.3257737972923302
In 31 patients distal tibia fracture was accompanied by a fracture of the fibula, which was first stablized using a plate.	2.5131349986315867
For reconstruction of the distal articular surface, covered screw osteosynthesis was done.	2.757693880568448
At the next step intramedullary nails were inserted and were statically locked proximally and distally.	2.0229000536806008
From January 1993 to February 1994, the reamed AO standard nail was used.	2.0505937894622654
After introduction of the unreamed tibial nail (UTN) all fractures were treated by this implant.	2.416637502787953
Full load on the operated leg was allowed after 8 weeks.	2.3731232425484006
Union of the fracture was assessed by standard radiological and clinical criteria.	2.8741521065774815
Misalignment was defined as more than 5  ° of angular rotation.	2.6607243701540697
Further surgery due to a valgus deformity in the ankle joint had to be done in three cases.	2.8526385469703204
There were no deep infections.	2.4443200554079025
Three patients had a superficial infection in the ankle area, but surgical debridement was not necessary.	2.453460583418228
A leg shortening was found in 4 cases, but it was less than 1 cm in every case.	2.94140006250956
Therefore, surgical correction was not done.	2.4475623267239635
Patients were reviewed at intervals of 2, 6, and 12 weeks, and after 6, and at least 12 months.	2.849076980256455
All 49 patients were finally reviewed after an average time of 15.7 months (range 12-38).	2.2626506369200285
Bone fusion was reached 12.8 weeks (range 9-21) after the operative treatment.	2.2765752767151297
A specific assessment of the ankle symptoms was made using the score of Olerud and Molander (1984).	2.345765951974418
In 29 patients excellent results were recorded.	2.4402073164188716
A satisfactory result was attained with 17 patients and just 3 patients were found to be unsatisfactory.	2.2554057583352023
Although proximity of distal tibia fracture to the ankle makes the treatment more complicated than for fractures of the tibial diaphysis, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a good alternative to open reduction and plate fixation.	2.0572766854297146
The major advantages are closed procedure and simplified interlocking techniques.	2.0915991740378854
Therefore, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a safe and effective method of managing this type of fracture.	2.165529220055278
Laryngeal candidiasis is very rare in the absence of other more proximal diseases in the aerodigestive tract.	2.4190763223190537
The lesion shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or acanthosis and, given its rarity, may be confused with cancer.	2.0641329829410684
In the present paper we report on a 56-year-old male patient who presented with hoarseness.	2.3986660122811925
Physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords.	2.4046567765403433
The clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient (ten bottles of beer and 40 cigarettes per day) generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer.	2.232928097476358
The histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma; however, it could not provide a clear diagnosis.	2.5112511528736374
Laryngeal papillomatosis and tuberculosis, which had been suspected, could be excluded.	2.4454155014499115
As the lesion progressed, further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis.	2.591896947051178
Systemic antimycotic treatment with fluconazol and amphotericin caused a complete remission.	2.1466291996853175
Lymphatic spread of bronchial carcinoma can reach any part of the mediastinum, irrespective of the localisation of the primary tumor.	2.4170738229293542
Metastatic spread may not affect al topographical lymph node positions, but this is unpredictable.	2.1431869953781204
The number of lymph nodes in each position varies.	2.519184329927973
Therefore, systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection includes all ipsilateral compartments of the mediastinum.	2.1850168180504976
It is also possible to reach contralateral sites.	2.508165244828547
In right-sided thoracotomies the lymph node dissection is standardized.	2.795811548945919
Mobilizing the aortic arch and the large vessels also allows complete mediastinal dissection by a left-sided approach.	2.129529637400747
The surgical technique is described.	2.605577119581541
Perioperative morbidity does not increase.	2.6834362713379023
Systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the gold standard for evaluation of an exact pN stage.	2.508300425636746
Therefore, it should be required that systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection be standard in the surgical treatment of bronchial carcinoma.	2.5293930095773023
In the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis.	2.481104807202953
A special case of a thirty-eight-year-old male asylant from Nepal was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain.	2.2635733212988214
To exclude testicular torsion, a diagnostic exploration of the scrotum was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation.	2.198256886078649
Under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared.	2.1600961021852703
The diagnosis of filarial funiculitis was made after identifying the microfilariae in a blood vessel and in the peripheral blood smear.	2.246315450216273
A filaricide medication with diethylcarbamacine citran was administered with good symptomatic relief.	2.0369960576059483
We studied 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients with Parkinson-plus-syndrome, trying to improve patients' gait by application of various external rhythmic stimuli, including metronome stimulation (96 beats per minute=middle andante).	1.8794045820662908
The test course of the patients was 4x10 meters and 3 U-turns.	2.8313677463191445
The patients' gait quality under stimulation was compared with their free walk (velocity, number of steps, number of freezing episodes).	2.0509705240132265
Metronome stimulation significantly reduced the time and number of steps needed for the test course and also diminished the number of freezing episodes.	2.3883001796574996
March music stimulation was less effective and tactile stimulation (rhythmically tapping on the patient's shoulder) even produced negative results.	1.9221734544861904
The positive effect of metronome stimulation was also found, when the tests were not performed inside the hospital building, but outside in the hospital parc.	2.0641252424366687
Metronome stimulation was comparably effective in both patient sub-groups examined in this study (M. Parkinson, Parkinson-plus-syndrome) and seems to be an important additional help in the treatment of these patients.	2.3981686686430574
Electronical metronomes are not expensive, easy in handling, and portable.	2.0903617718437046
A theoretical explanation of metronome stimulation effectivity in patients with Parkinson's disease still needs to be elucidated.	2.544814095502357
The occurrence of perineural epithelial complexes within the pancreas cannot always be regarded as evidence of malignancy.	2.1154458516782055
Chronic pancreatitis can induce alterations in the anatomy of the organ with a histological picture comparable to that of neural invasion.	2.2790727489496145
The important criteria for differential diagnosis are neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells or their ductular morphology without atypia.	2.128118451810172
Objectives Repair of acute rupture of the Achilles tendon through a percutaneous technique under general, regional, or local anesthesia.	2.145161410991723
Deciduosis of the appendix is a rare cause of acute appendicitis in pregnancy.	2.7197137262588984
Ectopic decidual cells localized in the submesothelial stroma may represent a physiologic reaction of the pluripotent stromal cells to progestational hormonal stimulation.	1.9644164885066262
Less frequently, deciduosis is based on a preexisting extragenital endometriosis, visible in a localization other than strictly submesothelial, in residuals of cyclic proliferation and bleeding, and in endometrial glandular formations embedded in the decidual cells.	1.925261438190584
In 14 patients with acute LBP the effect of manual therapy was examined.	2.6906163263503227
The examination was conducted with the Triflexometer, which is an electromechanical measuring instrument for examination of the posture and function of the spine.	2.5567392329229537
This instrument makes possible the measurement of the spine in resting as well as in moving positions, and it is also suitable for recording local disturbances of the movement.	2.577597212628652
Improvement in movement was detected in all patients following manual therapy, as well as in ante-, retro- and lateral flexion on both sides, and local functional disturbances also disappeared partially or totally.	2.2370179164141897
Our study shows that the Triflexometer makes it possible to record the effect of manual therapy in acute LBP.	2.3671324157738627
The proof of the local functional disturbances after manual therapy indicates that these patients have a higher risk of new episodes of acute LBP or perhaps of chronic LBP, and because of that there it is necessary to use other treatment forms.	2.1036593449234697
Diagnostic imaging after renal transplantation is of high importance in the differential diagnosis of peri-and postoperative complications.	2.4492435610089536
Sonography with color duplex imaging is the method of choice in the diagnosis of acute transplant rejection.	2.6209288284431445
MRI is an additional method in the diagnosis of transplant dysfunction especially in diagnosis of perirenal fluid collections.	2.4482927728126045
MR angiography and MR urography are noninvasive diagnostic modalities with the potential to replace angiography and pyelography.	2.0446835918859168
Angiography, complemented by carbon dioxide angiography, still is the gold standard in the diagnosis of transplant artery stenosis.	2.405381699759924
Nutrients and trophic factors independent of nutritional substrates influence the proliferation and the differentiation of the cells that make up the intestinal wall.	2.0785235691084125
The resorptive mucosa must be differentiated from immunologically active cells of the "gut-associated lymphatic tissue" (GALT).	2.122883636207577
Glutamine is the main oxidative substrate of enterocytes and an important nitrogen donor; its importance becomes apparent in very sick patients.	1.969141538197241
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are mainly important for immunological gut cells as precursors of NO and polyamine synthesis.	1.8100645648770313
Complex carbohydrates are fermented in the lower gut portions to short-chain fatty acids, mainly acetic, propionic and butyric acid.	1.8959405016777282
The trophic effect of these acids is also mediated via an improvement of blood flow.	2.3810221703799064
Among the trophic substances independent of nutrients are the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon and various growth factors, contributing to the maintenance of a eutrophic gut mucosa.	1.9601890421046364
We investigated 88 Patients with a total of 102 angiographically diagnosed intracranial aneurysms by means of transcranial colour coded Duplex sonography (TCCD) during a time period of 15 months.	2.20340525827356
Both the size and teh localization of teh aneuryms were determined.	2.111427784553718
Seventy aneurysms (77%) with a diameter of 16 +/- 8 mm (6-55mm) were detectable, with excellent visualization in 36 (42%), moderate visualization in 34 (40%), and no sufficient visualization in 16 (16%) aneurysms, respectively.	2.3354533580549326
Thrombotic material inside the aneurysm was detectable in 16/20 cases (75%), visualization of coil embolized aneurysms in 12/25 patients (48%).	2.0127248836423948
TCCD allows the follow up of cerebral aneurysms, with the detection of thrombosis and treatment effects after embolization.	2.7484385155232474
The method is not valid for the detection of intracranial aneurysms	2.8319121977301935
The authors report the case of a young patient suffering from plasmacellular osteomyelitis of the thoracic spine, a unusual localisation of this type of chronic osteomyelitis.	2.3593896060723694
They discuss the role of imaging diagnostic modalities in this disease, focussing on MRI.	2.556443716183573
The Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) is a new instrument to analyze the three-dimensional structure of the retina.	2.7590573672459717
It is based on confocal laser scanning technology.	2.795552824061884
Scientific interest has so far focused on the follow-up of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage.	2.502634832620541
As parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be reproduced with a high degree of accuracy, this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk.	2.1609395178995037
Evaluation of three patients, aged between three months and five years because of failure to thrive and persistent diarrhea revealed the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth.	2.3405005240229024
A combination of a typical history, endoscopy, laboratory, radiological and histological methods as well as the breath hydrogen test were used.	2.395611618664945
All patients had preexisting intestinal disease: two (former premature infants) had been operated several times because of necrotizing enterocolitis including resection of larger parts of small bowel.	1.8955509154991652
The third patient was suffering from pancolonic Hirschsprung's disease.	2.1912596991462117
All patients gained weight and reported less complaints after antibiotic treatment with metronidazole.	2.0422809045332846
Discussion: Small bowel bacterial overgrowth has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of failure to thrive, especially in cases with preexisting intestinal disease.	2.6707558545841916
The diagnosis may be substantiated by a combination of indirect methods.	2.5466246210069126
Direct bacteriologic analysis is difficult.	2.586051354781376
Usually, antibiotic treatment leads to a good weight gain after a short period of time.	2.3487348720925776
In contrast to carotid endarterectomy, the indication for vertebral surgery is not standardized.	2.3104766875710996
In a prospective study including 44 patients, it was investigated whether extended diagnostics help in making the decision as to whether operative treatment should be given.	2.304057103189641
The diagnostic procedures included DSA, CCT, MRI, 24 h ECG, otoneurological, and neurological examination, and ultrasonic flow measurement.	1.9657764951504448
We compared the diagnostic results before and after surgery with the subjective symptoms of the patients.	2.5356658557131317
Two different surgical procedures were used: transposition of the vertebral artery to the CCA or graft implantation between CCA and atlas loop.	2.093023100467023
In the follow up period (6 - 9 months), 72% of the patients had improved or were without complaints.	2.4984407248115184
The validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement.	2.010757008357721
In our opinion, exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery.	1.9886656420288396
A three-dimensional binocular method is naturally needed especially with surgical procedures that affect three dimensions of ocular motility.	2.0419093068962098
In situations of depressed myocardial function, the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently.	2.384863027736197
In different pathophysiological situations, such as chronic heart failure, open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation, cardiac transplantation, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and reversible myocardial dysfunction, which may represent a final common pathway.	2.4004943856602368
The available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function, i.e., contractility, preload, afterload, and heart rate, by cytokines.	2.000084349682754
Potential mechanisms include the -adrenoceptor- and nitric oxide pathway, as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis.	2.3054774847802832
Interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge.	2.1833267388540323
A prospective randomized study was designed to determine the effect of postoperative water contact on tissue healing.	2.5919433866952626
A total of 121 patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups.	2.0338584843309846
The first group was permitted to shower postoperatively, allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water, the second group was instructed to keep the incision dry.	1.7900080780896677
Water contact, wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed.	2.41481332606484
There was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection.	2.3715594211533957
In children and adolescents motor/vocal tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior are known to be closely related.	2.125867565070635
Thereby, a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics/rituals/obsessive-compulsive traits to clinically relevant obsessions and compulsions could be described.	1.7472500877560526
As neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits (sensorimotor circuit in tic symptomatology, orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive-compulsive behavior) were postulated.	1.6404689407137323
For both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to counterregulate tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior, respectively, and psychopharmacological agents can be administerd to compensate dysbalances in neurotransmitter systems.	1.9875963677615047
In case of a mixed symptomatologic picture it is necessary to include interventions for both pols of the symptom-continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient.	2.217301283891312
As laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established, interest in legal aspects increases.	2.1149322847059278
The legal cases dealt with in Germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in 1989 were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications.	2.241031009074455
Of 40 cases, 16 were judged to be cases of malpractice, whereas 24 were not.	2.027050912116336
The most common cause was injury of the common bile duct (26 cases).	2.2812892673831406
Seven of these 26 cases were judged to be cases of malpractice, 2 of these as grave errors.	2.0406049357477696
The main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy, delayed revision, laparoscopic revisions and not reverting to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations.	1.9099130006004563
Purpose of this review is, to highlight key issues in transplantation medicine today and to summarise basic information on current state of perfused organ transplantation.	2.0080563446329482
There is special emphasis on ethical and legal considerations with regard to living donor transplantation, brain death concept, donor consent and organ allocation.	2.1053170220956035
Transplantation frequencies and the impact of whole organ transplantation on the treatment concept for patients with end stage organ disease is heavily dependent on donor and organ availability.	2.255933617108076
Organ donor rate of 25 to 30 donors per million inhabitants per year seems to yield sufficient organ supply for patients on renal replacement therapy.	1.878706804097633
15 to 20 liver transplantations per million inhabitants per year, my be sufficient, to cover the need of organs for non malignant end stage liver diseases.	2.0829155366788887
This frequency my be achieved by increasing donor rates and employing "split techniques", where one liver is used for two recipients.	2.1102473853424146
One year graft survival in kidney transplantation can be expected to be between 85 and 90 %, one year patient survival in heart and liver transplantation can be expected to be beyond 80 %.	2.0289250097852785
The risk of organ failure is highest in the first year, long term results are dependent on incidence of chronic rejection, comorbidity of the patient and original disease.	2.4593916509105664
Patient- and/or graft loss after the first year is in the order of 1 to 5 %.	2.804672568894035
Whole organ transplantation for kidneys, hearts and livers are considered routine procedures, lung transplantation is reaching standard phase, pancreas and combined pancreas kidney transplantation is well established technically, but its indication is still controversial.	1.8074930202698127
Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a promising method of treating different types of tumors.	2.4207494849329314
To increase the effectiveness of LITT, a new thermo-controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed.	2.2879092005147257
This laser system consists of a laser applicator 3 mm in diameter, insertion equipment and an Nd:YAG laser source.	2.1364517583167615
The power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by thermosensors in a water-cooling system of the laser applicator.	2.1631585449333475
In in vivo experiments in five pigs, within 10 min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of 3 cm and 5 cm in diameter.	1.9950657652573764
Via ultrasound we observed in real time the increasing coagulation zone that appeared as a hyperechogenic halo.	2.066719788639764
However, due to perifocal edema, the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound.	2.0696451199197448
Macroscopically and microscopically, the coagulation zones showed well-demarcated borders of the coagulation lesions, and the surrounding tissue appeared vital.	2.4390198597783823
The reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis.	2.221646173257687
As a result, the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed.	1.9985710378631503
The absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo-controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable.	2.1328491918317445
Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy (research).	2.0615042532888532
This review starts with a definition of central concepts and hypotheses of this theory and summarizes results regarding the development as well as correlates of attachment, mainly from research in developmental psychology.	2.0353245170690215
Related to adults, attachment theory has to be reconceptualized which is done in another part of this paper.	2.4473915613279593
Finally, some common methods for the assessment of adult attachment are described which play an important role in clinical studies (these will be the content of the part 2 of this review).	2.293239253828363
Inflammation-mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation.	2.190153577091535
We found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process, in addition cytokines are increased.	2.3567890173768826
Treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation.	2.1211909791540786
Anxiolysis with drugs and psychoprophylaxis are both recognised methods of preoperative preparation.	2.0895695055325443
The beneficial effects of anxiolytics, however, appear to be difficult to prove.	3.1766223333631216
In this study a comparison was made of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol levels.	2.3485957648018654
In group I 19 children recieved only psychological treatment, while in group II 21 children received 0.2 mg/kg midazolam orally.	2.1377215617620235
Measuring points were directly before medication, 30 min afterward, and at induction of anaesthesia.	2.2367737884115124
During the observation period the patients (5-10 years old) remained calm.	2.9648580792779047
At the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range; 30 min after premedication the HR and BP were significantly higher in group I than in group II.	2.582262188603783
In contrast to group I, epinephrine levels in group II were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication.	2.425221347859212
In both groups, norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication.	2.1444284117314756
Cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam.	3.042764994023818
HR, BP, as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children.	2.299861255123266
A case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented.	2.0181000611662077
The diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging.	2.1808915276879883
The diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid.	2.0517030808299617
This is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy.	2.2772412937649564
Myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of intraparietal masses visualized at echocardiography.	2.012093221333632
The incidence of hepatitis A infections has decreased due to improved hygienic conditions in Germany.	2.1097713775067386
However, hepatitis A is one of the most important diseases imported to the country.	2.4274368837165063
Currently, more than the half of all registered hepatitis A infections are acquired in foreign countries.	2.1937291944518034
According to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people (age below 50 years) are not immunized and, subsequently, this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries.	1.910961284528632
Therefore, a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis A (Southern Europe, Africa, South America, and Asia).	1.8796276235849336
Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram-positive organism, which have in common a fermentative metabolism with lactic acid as the major end-product.	1.9793675572803433
Except for bifidobacteria, the LAB are phylogenetically closely related.	2.0818718448314875
They are, furthermore, an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora.	2.5629873983346445
The genus Streptococcus contains highly pathogenic species which can be clearly differentiated from the useful germs.	2.227697404924085
The intestinal flora contains such species of the genus Lactobacillus that are also important in food fermentation and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore, can be found exclusively in this ecological niche.	2.00315533622023
A special status characterises bifidobacteria and enterococci.	2.23486409457494
The former are located in a separate phylogenetic branch and also occur virtually exclusively in the intestines.	2.0714991111181353
Enterococci are rather ubiquitous, participate in indigenous food fermentations, are found in the mucosal flora and are counted as opportunistic pathogens.	1.9874054397455352
To influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects LAB are isolated from the intestinal flora, grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or additions to food (usually fermented milk).	1.7826678168766548
These bacteria are termed "probiotics".	2.5018222981036753
In this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion.	2.2515583232532657
In front of this background, LAB in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe, nevertheless some restrictions have to be made.	2.3535374904476734
Generally, the germs used should not contain genes encoding transmissible resistance to antibiotics.	1.9331977568007368
In addition they should not produce biogenic amines (e.g.	1.968621839375567
histamine, tyrosine or phenylethylamine) and should not degrade mucine.	2.1645485623665173
The assessment may also include the following: absence of a potential for deconjugation of bile salts, induction of platelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen and fibronectine.	1.8862895678040748
These examinations may be required as certain LAB have been identified in clinical isolates.	2.3315895133311657
The germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment, organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated.	2.3099150896140914
Dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon.	2.5117440259353696
Due to the nonspecific symptomatology, as well as the manifold etiology, clinical diagnosis may be difficult.	2.4157308380829927
In these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat.	1.9622200707919832
The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical CT in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis.	2.268482944614684
In 20 patients with clinically suspected thrombosis CT angiography was performed.	2.535813032686413
In 6 patients dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed.	2.3090004976523693
In order to acquire also arterial vessels, a short delay of about 22 s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected.	2.3274229100368653
By this method we found an occlusion of the MCA in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis.	2.5259720958372514
In all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an "empty delta" sign.	1.8388608873886876
With irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus.	2.4228951077757968
The MIP reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage.	2.48831536598563
In three patients MR angiograms were available for comparison.	2.314025080632842
The smaller veins, such as the v. vermis inferior, were less clearly depicted than in CT angiography.	2.219873603818971
CT angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis.	2.1937593792009946
It can be performed immediately after non-enhanced CT.	2.605220020025797
According to our present experience CT angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis.	2.535584126295723
Coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.	3.0851950436124005
Only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries, however.	2.241113236107942
With intravascular ultrasound, on the other hand, pathological changes in the vascular wall can be recorded.	2.673344289523132
Despite typical symptoms, an angiographical image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries.	2.3046448533399704
In such cases, intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings.	1.9029399981205195
Two cases are used to illustrate this.	2.6700485296181564
Purpose: The pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex, but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear.	2.0441116752047956
The cerebral cortex is involved in coordinating micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions.	1.9551927464663585
The present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by EEG power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned.	1.8965059609137294
We also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation (IVES) therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity.	2.1655630240642716
Background: Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe, potential vision-threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment.	1.9275016117460548
In general, any therapy has been dis-cussed controversially in the literature.	2.028452282150581
Based upon experiences with spinal cord trauma, high-dose steroid therapy is recommended initially to minimize secondary consequences following orbital trauma.	2.098561165646745
In recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) in otherwise healthy adults.	2.0276373081110384
It is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about 30 %.	2.0929091737593355
This paper describes the history of two patients with severe streptococcal TSLS.	2.9157737981709686
Various aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy are discussed.	3.15083765472621
Only early, aggressive and repeated surgical debridement can reduce the bacterial load and decrease circulating exotoxins and thereby, in combination with antibiotic therapy, decrease the high mortality of this entity.	2.11762418175137
Purpose: To test, whether axial, coronal and sagittal MIP and MPR reconstructions of diagnostic quality can be obtained from 1-mm collimation MSCT data of the chest for the evaluation of thoracic anatomy and pathology.	2.134046169581394
The risk to health posed by a sedentary lifestyle is a problem of our times.	2.027374652758857
In contrast to the previous assumption that only fairly high-intensity sporting exercise undertaken over a minimum period of 20 min produces health-related benefits, recent studies have shown that even everyday activitites (climbing stairs, brisk walking and cycling) can have a benedicial effects on health, particularly in those who take little exercise.	1.7935492958407546
So now the recommendation is: exercise of moderate intensity lasting 30 min at least 5 times a week, corresponding to an energy consumption of about 150 kacl/day or 1000 kcal/week.	1.7431518915837354
The results of experimental studies on sport and arthritis and sport and osteoporosis point to the advisability of taking up or maintaining an active sporting lifestyle.	1.8042404478258935
For one thing, it can be assumed that a moderate amount of movement does not increase the risk of developing arthritis: for another, sporting activity during early and late childhood produces a high maximum bone mass, therby delaying the development of osteoporosis in later life.	2.0773514932002572
The new guidelines on the extent and intensity of health-giving exercise make it easier to advocate exercise and sport for disease prevention and health promotion because they appear to implement.	1.8699399540598374
More difficult, however, is deciding on a suitable method for motivating inactive individuals to increase their level of physical acitivity.	2.124072907411614
A model that has proved effective in smoking cessation programmes, and one that can also be applied to exercise counselling (transtheoretical model), can help in the selection of an appropriate counselling strategy.	2.1450180201746716
Depending on whether an individual is inactive, or sporadically or regularly active, each one employs his or her own strategies primarily to maintain this lifestyle.	1.8138629407636973
Assuming that the counselling is adapted to the level of activity, the patient's attitude and behaviour can be influenced both more effectively and more economically.	2.1986948496537915
Background: Photorefraktive keratectomy (PRK) is the most frequent refractive surgical procedure worldwide.	2.5484926620543926
The central corneal thickness is reduced due to removal of the anterior stroma, including Bowman's layer, with a laser beam.	2.461116648180502
This procedure results in considerable alterations of the corneal structure.	2.2926518995321277
What does this mean for the mechanical properties of the cornea?	2.776790782774553
He started from considerations of egopathology, sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns.	2.1901937419298996
Thus he began to mobilize repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions.	1.8620567181798884
That way their meaning in the person's history could be understood and a self-healing process restarted.	2.12868237387196
This approach to release constrained energy is still valid for neoreichian schools such as bioenergetics, biodynamics, biosynthesis and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy.	1.803203972339636
Besides there are impulses in modern body psychotherapies to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts.	2.0043960275073975
Recurrent phlebothromboses in young patients with subsequent severe postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous leg ulcers may be caused by underlying hereditary disorders of hemostasis or may occur as part of other congenital syndromes.	2.0308852835893765
The most common hereditary disorders of hemostasis in this respect appear to be deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S, and activated protein C resistance (mutations of factor V).	1.8569718107109208
Less frequently, dysfibrinogenemia, increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, or deficiencies of tissue plasminogen activator or heparin cofactor II may be found.	1.8403891918854676
Klinefelter's syndrome and homocystinuria are prime examples of those rare congenital disorders indirectly associated with an elevated risk of thrombosis in young individuals.	2.0836675241690674
Early diagnosis of these disorders will allow timely treatment, preventive care and counselling of patients as well as family members.	2.3979817152970493
Epidurography with contrast medium is used to verify the correct poition of an epidural catheter and to detect malpositioning.	2.2367380426097863
Results of investigations of the anatomy of the spinal canal and epidural space performed with anatomic specimens, epiduroscopy, and conventional and computed tomographic (CT) epidurography are sometimes contradictory.	2.0929593573097898
We have performed CT epidurography in approximately 30 patients to date.	2.1733330869240293
Insights regarding the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space can help to interpret conventional epidurographies and to explain special features, such as the "rail-road-track phenomenon" or the plica mediana dorsalis.	2.1055724064332613
Patients scheduled for major abdominal operations were studied.	2.3073529875513556
Catheters were introduced into the thoracic epidural space on the day before the operation.	2.380659059756191
Conventional epidurographies were performed routinely after insertion of the catheters with a mobile X-ray apparatus, usually in the recovery room, using 5 ml iopamidol (Solutrast 250 M).	2.00054165950133
Selected patients (good mental state and stable psychic condition), after written consent and with approval of the local ethical committee, were investigated with CT epidurography using the same contrast medium (partly diluted).	1.9184830796263315
From among the CT scans performed until now, five characteristic images are presented and compared to conventional epidurographies.	2.522159786483343
When small volumes (5 mL) of iopamidol were injected slowly, we regularly observed a railroad-track phenomenon in the AP images of conventional epidurographies.	1.8299600498089137
After rapid injection of larger volumes (10 - 15 ml), the spread was more homogeneous and sometimes outline a lighter zone of contrast distribution in the midline.	2.2379014676865716
CT epidurography in these cases (5 out of 30 patients) revealed a plica mediana dorsalis.	2.3250151572686897
In the majority of the CT scans of the thoracic epidural space its anterior (ventral) compartment was unfilled by contrast medium.	2.139014583678752
According to the findings of several investigators, dura mater and ligamentum longitudinale posterius have grown together, so that an epidural space does not exist in ventral thoracic segments of the spinal canal.	1.981915043293092
In lower thoracic and lumbar segments both structures are separate, and a wide anterior epidural space was present and filled with contrast medium.	2.1354795214748847
In other cases the dorsal and dorsolateral epidural space was completely filled, but the contrast medium stopped behind the spinal nerves and surrounding dural sheaths, as if these structures, together with the connective tissue strands between them, formed a membrane that spread in a frontal plane.	1.8891459787032623
According to conventional epidurographies and confirmed by CT scans, this feature is also seen regulary in cases with correct catheter position.	2.191788431294817
Small volumes of iopamidol spread preferentially into the wider parts of the epidural space between the gaps of the vertebral arcs, whereas the dura mater and periosteal layers touch at the inner side of the pedicules and laminae, allowing the existence of only a potential epidural space.	2.048425791523439
This rhythmic widening and narrowing of the epidural space is the explanation of the "railroad track" in AP contrast epidurographies.	2.0599970524247335
CT epidurography is a valuable tool to provide better insight into the morphology of the epidural space when filled with fluid (contrast medium, local anaesthetics), complementing findings using epiduroscopy and anatomic specimens.	1.969947926044336
It stands to reason that this time- and cost-expensive method can never replace conventional epidurographies, but can help to interpret them properly.	2.0641416948909206
A 71-year-old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft X-ray therapy (total dose 28 Gy, half dose depth 10.5-11.5 mm).	2.035866658579168
5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed.	2.571757325814477
This unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy, presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens.	2.1973520548797927
However, this possibility cannot be entirely excluded.	2.1498866444459828
A vascular etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been long debated.	2.3079350219906805
In order to search for an ischemic basis of PD we assessed the clinical symptomatology of a consecutive group of 60 PD patients and compaired their frequency of cerebrovascular risk factors, carotid atherosclerosis and ischemic brain lesions with age-matched groups of stroke patients and normals.	1.897418145654358
There were 16 (27%) subjects with PD who also had symptoms of cerebrovascular disease.	2.079629806148718
The frequencies of carotid stenoses, ischemic brain lesions and most of cerebrovascular risk factors seen in the latter group was comparable with those of stroke patients and significantly higher than in the investigational subsets of patients with "pure" PD and normals.	2.3135599873589725
These findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease occurs in approximately one fourth of patients with PD, but seldomly is causally related.	2.3399870991761036
Neurological involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis.	3.057728060304867
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis.	2.7959873394394323
The MRI brain scans of 22 patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed, along with the clinical information provided in the request form.	2.0939271345548702
All patients had signs and symptoms referable to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement.	2.3011517081120365
Cranial (facial) nerve paralysis was the most common clinical manifestation identified in 10 patients.	2.539165697193593
A wide spectrum of MR findings was noted: periventricular and white matter lesions on T2 W spin echo images, mimicking multiple sclerosis (46%); multiple supratentorial and infratentorial brain lesions, mimicking metastases (36%); solitary intraaxial mass, mimicking high-grade astrocytoma (9%); solitary extraaxial mass, mimicking meningioma (5%); leptomeningeal enhancement (36%).	1.8367868958145919
The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is often difficult, particularly so in patients who lack either pulmonary or systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis.	2.0525330988784587
MRI shows a wide spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with neurosarcoidosis.	2.273896727070187
These findings, however, are not specific for sarcoidosis and one must consider appropriate clinical circumstances in arriving at the correct diagnosis.	2.210376743553899
In selected cases with isolated brain involvement, meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required.	2.064891049978179
In 1990, we first described the papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS).	1.891234970876807
It is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever.	2.131949593439299
The skin  lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days.	2.0992228353818487
In more than half of the patients, an acute parvovirus B 19 infection has been proven.	2.648217493920236
In a few cases of PPGSS, other viral infections have been found, for example hepatitis B and measles.	2.340941667844986
We report on a patient with PPGSS and review the literature.	2.1562957922392356
Fungus-bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe Candida albicans infection.	2.0843690242187636
A newborn infant with VACTERL-association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after Candida albicans sepsis, and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure.	1.805355215999573
Following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin B via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly.	2.1363830651799542
Discussion: Since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should include fungus balls.	2.301222112615031
Interactional understanding in psychoanalysis, especially the concept of the 'third point', suggests that the development of insight, empathy and relationship are dimensions of one and the same triangulating process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding.	2.148596006699324
In this context the psychoanalytic method, here understood as working with resistance, transference and countertransference, does not only offer a route to cognition, but also to the formation of a conflict-solving, egostrengthening, and supportive relationship peculiar to psychoanalysis.	1.8265455246631357
The formula 'interpretation on the basis of countertransference' describes a form of psychoanalytic interpretation that takes up this context intentionally and can thus also be used for crisis intervention in the case of neurotic conflicts.	2.1976160922617263
This is exemplified by a case history.	2.592976042241086
The Dutch Supreme Court ruled that in exceptional instances, physician-assisted suicide might be justifiable for patients with unbearable mental suffering but no physical illness.	1.8990031816729667
Some of those requests were granted and their medical background was described.	2.0539317934040935
Psychiatric consultation for medical patients who request physician-assisted suicide is relatively rare.	2.095686927976957
Pemphigus is a rare intraepidermal autoimmune bullous disease.	2.887235230681808
Two major variants, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), are distinguished.	1.9673175058047774
The aim of this study was to document the clinical and immunpathological findings in all pemphigus patients who were diagnosed in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Würzburg over the past 10 years.	2.329360288603448
Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia.	2.5016911807325437
Diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient's age have been proven to be important determinants.	2.7991382857541725
The question of whether post-operative recumbency can reduce the risk of PDPH has not been answered uniformly.	2.5300553027701738
And besides, some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures, for example, as to clear definition and exact documentation of post-operative immobilization.	2.063626612062604
Furthermore, fine-gauge needles (26G or more) have not been investigated yet.	2.1330181189163118
Secondly, we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified, atraumatic tip (Whitacre and Atraucan) by comparing them to Quincke needles of identical diameter.	1.7454929972449957
Most of the former investigators compared Quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on PDPH.	2.117747612307209
Three characteristic developments in modern western societies usually are considered to be independent variables in the ethical discussion:...	2.119029544982013
Background: Neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system.	2.4583389330796708
The pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).	2.016357411643446
Typical disorders with a SMP component are complex regional pain syndromes (reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia), traumatic neuralgias and herpes zoster.	1.7900286475678415
In order to improve functional results, creation of a colonic J-pouch in conjunction with a coloanal anastomosis (CPA) was proposed.	2.0232734966081507
Two different operation techniques exist: i) Double-stapling with the anastomosis close to the dentate line and ii) intersphincteric resection with the anastomosis located immediately at the dentate line.	1.8606744780526785
A long rectal remnant after double-stapling leads to urgency in 15 % of the patients due to stool retention in the atonic remnant.	2.1489012066115047
No propulsive motility patterns were recorded from the pouch which is emptyed passively by upper colonic peristalsis.	1.9210842216555886
Therefore colonic pouches should be fashionned of descending colon and should not exceed a length of 6 cm in order to prevent stool fragmentation.	2.179734771996439
Under these conditions the average stool frequency is reduced from 2-6 /d after CAA to 1-3 /d after CPA.	2.1179440273309744
This effect is maximal during the first postoperative months, but is still significant after 3 years.	2.3726209798939153
Colonic pouch construction also leads, due to better blood supply and prevention of pelvic hematomas, to a significant decrease of the anastomotic insufficiency rate from 10,0 % after CAA to 5,4 % after CPA.	2.0892040557524854
Therefore creation of a colonic J-pouch should be combined with coloanal reconstruction if the oncologic situation allows a sphincter-preserving procedure.	1.8403285437521333
Background: Workers in the construction industry carry an increased risk for head and neck cancer due to the high consumption of alcohol and tobacco plus exposure to occupational carcinogenic or co-carcinogenic agents.	2.2019059140030275
These latter substances include asbestos, tar products, metal dust, wood dust, cement dust and paints.	1.7719928670976612
Presently, there are no well-defined standards for documentation of echocardiographic studies.	2.5131746942709396
Nevertheless, standards are essential to provide comparability of data and to realize electronic communication, both essential for quality management in echocardiography.	2.100857084843385
Embolia cutis medicamentosa (Nicolau Syndrom) is a very rare complication of intramuscular injections which presents with extensive necrosis of the injected skin area.	2.251900818530819
Intra-arterial and/or para-arterial injections after prior perforation of certain vessels are discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms.	2.282475246581891
We describe the occurrence of embolia cutis medicamentosa after intra-articular injections into the knee.	2.2469451432244214
In a 30-beds-unit of the Orthopedic University Clinic in Bochum for an example we studied the frequency of combined injection therapy with local anesthesia and chirotherapy in a one year period.	2.0484089716205967
There have been done 191 injections into ileosacral joints as well as 28 injections into facett joints of the cervical spine and additionally 315 into facett joints of the lumbar spine.	2.18202298508224
On the other side there have been done 122 chirotherapeutic maneuvers at cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine by senior doctors with education in manual medicine.	1.863899140631949
The injection therapy however was done in mean predilection sites of the patients suffering from cervical spine disorders or low back pain, the chirotherapy was done in other spine areas.	2.41811340043266
The growing number of doctors with an education in manual medicine seems to improve the chirotherapy of the mean pathology as well, but it is not able to reduce the number of local injection therapy.	2.4718411887014806
In a retrospective case control study at the University of Frankfurt, Germany, 101 babies born to opiate-addicted mothers were identified from birth charts from 1988 to 1995.	2.004974434925758
After birth, they developed a withdrawal syndrome (neonatal abstinence syndrome).	2.09360973059134
Fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards.	2.1382018731107424
The group of opiate-exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment (n=48) and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program (n=51).	1.956386513792991
The methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight (2822 g) than children in the group without methadone (2471 g).	2.1354013171988293
The abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group (convulsions 47.1%) than in heroin-exposed babies without methadone treatment (convulsions 27.1%).	1.8920501600581492
Women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate-addicted women without methadone substitution.	1.8951402668321449
Moreover, they cared significantly better for their babies: 81.3% of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90.9% cared adequately.	1.7925698504980287
The data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate-exposed babies.	2.3037296578831716
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease of high penetrance and variable expression.	2.2454155843629002
Epidemiologic data on craniofacial manifestations are still lacking.	2.2706550149037015
Surgical therapy is mainly based on tumour reduction, frequently combined with face-lifting.	2.0217507275203914
In our experience neurofibromas of the neck tend to be pseudo-encapsulated, facilitating the preparation of the tumour.	2.196234855500576
On the other hand, identification and preparation of diffuse infiltrating neurofibromas in the trigeminal nerve region are difficult and local recurrence must be expected.	1.8396806299012751
Objective: The revised Edwards-Duromedics valve was introduced onto the market in June 1990.	1.8814696028462543
In September 1993, the producer changed the name of the valve to TEKNA, which is a low profile, bileaflet, mechanical prosthesis with a self-irrigating hinge mechanism.	2.103283648766026
The results of a prospective follow-up study after valve replacement with this prosthesis are presented.	2.4771339336771696
A granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus.	3.115607397429247
We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient, who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.	2.3789149131316534
In the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found.	2.2360679082176
Repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis, although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded.	2.2204993389614103
After indicating the operative therapy, the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach.	2.4758262120111283
The histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus (tumor of Abrikossoff).	2.2448473557387083
There has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject, including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime, with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment.	2.3467490168561373
The case is discussed with a review of the literature.	2.4684229600411025
This review deals with the differential diagnosis and treatment of critically ill neuromuscular patients.	2.530451737805998
Acute muscular weakness may be a sign of newly acquired neuromuscular disorders or of an exacerbation of a previously existing disease.	2.164555862334596
Typical features of the more common neuromuscular conditions are presented and the problems of neurocritical care delineated.	2.566530053253315
The appropriate ancillary tests are presented.	2.339829457205142
Psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years, but for severely ill patients, often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care, the situation remains unsatisfactory.	2.1560253831330343
Community-based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care.	2.124454936647902
The quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined, and many patients end up in asylums or homeless shelters unable to provide for their psychiatric needs.	1.7098497993987498
Neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet.	2.145282176275838
A diagnostic scoring system, recently published by Ohmann et al.	2.135350093516781
in this journal, was validated by analyzing the clinicopathological data of a consecutive series of 2,359 patients, admitted for suspicion of acute appendicitis.	2.048983683287524
The results of the scoring system were compared to the results of clinical evaluation by junior (provisional) and senior surgeons (final clinical diagnosis).	2.204746455277368
To assess the diagnostic ability of the score, the accuracy and positive predictive value were defined as the major diagnostic performance parameters; the rate of theoretical negative laparotomies and that of diagnostic errors served as the major procedural performance parameters.	2.25591628272958
Of 2,359 patients admitted for suspected acute appendicitis, 662 were proven to have acute appendicitis by histology, for a prevalence of 28 %.	2.12533233141011
The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the provisional clinical diagnosis were 0.50, 0.94, 0.77, 0.83, and 0.82; 0.93, for the score 0.63, 0.93, 0.77, 0.86 and 0.84, and for the final clinical diagnosis 0.90, 0.94, 0.85, 0.96, and 0.93, respectively.	1.8640186636545577
Of the main diagnostic performance parameter, the accuracy of the score was signifianctly better than that of provisional clinical diagnosis (P < 0.05, 2 test).	2.276007733756437
The score yielded a rate of negative appendecomies and laparotomies of 14.3 and 12.3 %.	2.0324287895132906
With respect to the rate of overlooked cases of acute apendicitis, the score demonstrated a superior performance, with only 6 cases missed (0.9 %).	2.090386407159096
However, the number of patients with acute appendicitis, including those with perforated disease, who were not identified by the score, was almost four times that of the final clinical diagnosis (245 vs 63).	2.3933877528556824
With regard to the main procedural performance parameter, the score resulted in a significantly smaller number of diagnostic errors than the provisional clinical investigator (P < 0.05, 2 test).	2.1013050876300623
The results of this study indicate that the diagnostic scoring system might be helpful when experienced investigators or additional diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography are not available.	2.224909014291594
It may therefore be of value in the preclinical evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis and may be instrumental as a quality control tool and in clinical guidelines.	2.216088360833108
Purpose: The standards and regulations concerning the protection of patients and operator staff within the context of MRI are compiled.	2.2308040505963747
Resulting consequences regarding physical parameters are evaluated.	2.3212268701647023
Replacement of the tracheal conduit remains an unresolved problem.	2.2158629292475234
The microporous material expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) is suitable for tracheal reconstruction.	2.128484506825493
The aim of our study was to improve the limited mechanical properties of this material by incorporating reinforcement elements and to examine the influence of these elements on host incorporation and epithelialization.	2.2099049454285242
One of these prostheses was epithelialized by a cell seeding technique and was thus placed into a tracheal defect.	1.871063365500911
Results were examined grossly by endoscopy and than by light and scanning electron microscopy.	2.041476823370597
The shapes of both types of prostheses showed a high stability.	2.3218163903441575
The reinforcement elements did not impair bioincorporation or the ability to epithelialize.	2.2706534020267415
In vivo interposition of an incorporated and epithelialized prosthesis to a host led to cell differentiation.	1.9345257857958171
The improved biomechanical properties of the prostheses waid and the reproducible formation of epitheliums are important advances in the solution of effectively correcting tracheal defects.	2.016435741056541
Primary infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7) during early childhood causes permanent latent infection, usually without any ill effects; only a small percentage of primary infections will lead to exanthem subitum.	1.8555147612524663
Like other herpesviruses, HHV-6 and HHV-7 can be reactivated at any time if host defence mechanisms become defective (e.g.	1.8070296377055204
in transplant recipients, AIDS, tumour patients).	2.230133656936236
HHV-6 can be reactivated under such conditions and cause a variety of clinical problems, such as exanthems along with interstitial pneumonia or hepatitis for example.	2.244813982925748
In addition, the reactivated virus may influence the course of autoimmune and proliferative diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Hodgkin's disease.	2.053885945337737
Despite its widespread use there is no clear evidence that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by this approach.	2.6485552735521516
In contrast, it has been suggested that PAC might increase mortality.	2.331710766659169
Available data do not allow the definitive omission of PAC in medical intensive care, nor do they justify its widespread use.	2.0401707124819537
Possible reasons that might affect outcome are catheter-related complications and often misinterpretation due to insufficient knowledge about PAC.	2.1447724500363416
Open questions on the influence of PAC on outcome variables in critically ill patients have to be answered by conducting randomized controlled trials.	2.6791564365251253
Beforehand, knowledge about PAC has to be improved.	2.966166778843971
As a consequence, PAC should be performed whenever a specific hemodynamic question arises that cannot be answered by clinical judgement or by less invasive means.	2.043526549189871
It is important that the investigator be experienced in catheter placement and data interpretation to avoid harm to these critically ill patients.	1.8296650343530345
A long-term goal of assisted reproduction techniques should be the development of methods which are able to replace the high-dose stimulation with gonadotropins in order to limit the costs and risks of in vitro fertilization treatment.	2.7421290182389115
The in vitro maturation of immature oocytes derived from follicular aspirates and the in vitro growth of early follicles isolated from ovary biopsies are discussed as possible alternatives.	1.9987890971791475
Both methods are able to shift the application of stimulating hormones from the in vivo to an in vitro level, but are today still far away from being established in clinical routine.	2.157036497181237
The exact knowledge of the topographic anatomy of the urethra as well as the macro- and microcirculation of the penis [6] are the basics of reconstructive urethral surgery.	2.317057470371816
Adherence to the fundamentals and principles of tissue transfer [5] are necessary to fascilitate conditions for successful treatment of the various disorders of the male urethra.	2.4533712577055895
Mutural description of the anatomy of the male urethra in conjunction with external male genitals is necessary because of developmental similarities as well as the close anatomical relationship.	2.4093244830038256
The arterial and venous blood supply of the urethra and the penis have to be taken into account if vascularized flaps from the penile skin or the prepuce are used in urethral reconstruction.	2.197223118859515
The dual arterial and venous vascularity of the genital skin is of fundamental importance to a successful outcome of the operative treatment.	2.34065086650793
The purpose of this article is, to summarize the relevant anatomical knowledge of reconstructive urethral surgery.	2.0069772048451693
In this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas, the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint, is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium-term outcome in 40 patients treated conservatively and 72 patients treated surgically by arthroscopy.	2.1189420930659355
The criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis.	2.285593818086361
The stages on MRI follow the morphology of the interface, i.e., the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone, on T1- and T2-weighted images.	1.8827820191659563
After 18 and 24 months there were no substantial differences visible on MRI between the two different treatment groups.	2.2833163550794753
Arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a reintegration in the sense of upgrading on the MRI (36% to 30%); nevertheless, a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases (4%).	2.4000717938400227
In both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis, juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms.	2.3988105380546147
The number of women with congenital cardiac disease, who mature into adulthood is increasing.	2.1491220199438166
Unfortunately, there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients.	2.2887492677014976
Oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events.	2.8166336346958087
Intrauterine devices are very effective, have no metabolic side effects and merely cary a small risk of endocarditis.	2.1009363090241977
Contraceptive subdermal implants (e.g.	2.3164319236922446
levonorgestrel) are used with good results in the United States for patients with contraindications to estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and may well become more widely accepted in patients in Germany in the coming years.	2.246356719938051
Barrier methods can be used, but have a higher failure rate, which may be inacceptable in patients at risk (e.g.	2.4591280705660687
Especially in Eisenmenger's, permanent sterilisation should be advised.	2.0701881884240207
Two groups of 15 patients each with disseminated intravascular coagulation in association with septic disease were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin  (lmw-heparin) in different dosages (group I: 1,5-5 IE/kg body weight (BW) per hour; group II: 8-15 IE/kg BW).	2.16646938489029
We studied the levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PTF), and global tests of coagulation like prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), thrombin time (TT) and platelet count, plasminogen activation (PA) and fibrinogen concentration to estimate the success of heparin therapy in the two groups.	1.8931365726551797
TT and fibrinogen concentration were not suitable to follow the course of the coagulation disorder.	2.6275458596173635
PT, PTT, platelet count progressively PA, D-dimer, TAT, and PTF normalised progressively after heparinisation.	1.8284909518124937
However, only the last three parameters were sensitive enough to show different effects of variable dosages of lmw-heparin.	1.931688338190021
D-dimer, TAT, and PTF levels declined in proportion with heparin concentrations, and thus appear to be the most useful parameters for monitoring the therapeutic effect of heparin in septic coagulopathies.	2.066797058181152
In patients with acute or chronic myocarditis, arrhythmias are a common and often the only clinical symptom in the natural course of the disease.	2.2491962348842365
Factors responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias are structural changes, parameters of ventricular dynamics and vascular changes.	2.2064720071245194
On the one hand, inflammatory processes in the cardiac myocytes and interstitium can lead directly to fluctuations in membrane potential.	1.9987816001326084
Fibrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue and secondary hypertrophy and atrophy of the myocytes favor the development of ectopic pacemakers, late potentials and reentry as a result of inhomogeneous stimulus conduction.	2.187278231876974
Furthermore, parameters of ventricular dynamics such as increased wall tension, increased myocardial oxygen consumption and diminished coronary reserve in the case of disturbed systolic or diastolic left ventricular function also contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmias.	2.043866719408876
Lastly, vascular factors can further increase the arrhythmogenicity of the inflamed myocardium through the disturbance of micro- and macrovascular perfusion and the resulting myocardial ischemia.	2.0096989600723325
Non-invasive rhythmological evaluation by 24 h Holter ECG, measurement of ventricular late potentials and heart rate variability can be used for orienting risk stratification of the at-risk patient with myocarditis.	2.237980026218673
Programmed atrial and ventricular electrophysiological stimulation also has a relatively high predictive value for spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	2.374951434971493
It should be emphasized that, at the present time, optimal electrophysiological parameters with a high predictive value do not exist.	2.2182690810860217
In a selected patient population, immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy can lead to the reduction or complete suppression of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias.	2.280099088527036
Nevertheless, in the interim, further precautionary antiarrhythmic measures such as serial antiarrhythmic treatment, VT ablation and AICD implantation are necessary in patients with malignant cardiac arrhythmias.	2.2102581314733563
Right ventricular myocardial biopsy for demonstration or exclusion of myocarditis is an important additional examination which can improve the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias of unclear etiology.	2.5035177780436393
Aim: To investigate the distribution of collagens in experimental microvascular surgery.	2.379729133878131
Material and methods: Autografts (4 mm) of the left common carotid artery in 20 Wistar rats were harvested up to 4 weeks after surgery.	2.2634650550088735
The specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of collagen III and IV.	2.223935438569428
Results: The demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture.	2.44015911278112
In the intima, the organisation and amount of collagen IV was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments.	2.057757164897894
The media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for regenerating the continuity break.	1.8996853679195598
The adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis, in which collagen III and IV-positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion.	2.0141071655176006
The marked myointimal hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was made up of collagen-positive extracellular matrix.	2.2935450171454117
Conclusions: Our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery.	2.0415292953473
The identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery.	2.0626898833670952
We treated 8123 patients with invasive malignant melanoma were treated up to 1995.	2.0879049820209086
Three had second primary tumors with greater thickness.	2.323203993740977
One case showed metastasis from another tumor.	2.2585130298368314
In two cases the metastases were not ascertained histologically.	2.329961052101109
The remaining 39 cases showed some peculiarities: a greater proportion of late and of internal (as contrasted to regional) metastases.	1.8519853401789295
Most of these primary tumors had a Breslow thickness of more than 0.5 mm and were Clark level III or even IV.	1.977584036786261
Male patients and primary tumor sites in the area of head and neck were significantly over-represented.	2.499550536459674
In this paper the question is considered to what extent the patient's and analyst's perception and tolerance of both aggressive and destructive elements of the analytic relationship can be increased.	2.030911390312175
Successful interpretation enables the patient to feel, enact and comprehend animosity in the transference and experience that the relationship can continue.	1.9594447112193283
The concept of primary aggression developed in Freud's speculation on death instinct is discussed in its clinical function of relief.	1.9364722464668802
The metapsychological concept of primary aggression facilitates work on aggressive and especially destructive developments of the relationship.	2.053812602128364
Freud's and subsequently Eissler's examination of the reciprocity of destructiveness and narcissism opened plausible clinical avenues to explain the compensation of defence mechanisms against mankind's vulnerability in the face of mortality.	1.8898473313517712
The concept of primary aggression is obviously of greater relevance than frustration/aggression models since the former does not view the patient as mere victim of his biography, but as a subject with the potential to enact his own destructiveness.	1.7451330345670553
Since aggressiveness is often concomitant with fear and suppressed guilt, interpretation plays a decisive role in relieving the superego strain; more confrontation may involve the analyst in the role of the persecutor.	1.8042859026552047
Sudden and violent feelings of hate towards the analyst require careful treatment of the patient's irritation.	2.3664793209713544
Interpretation of genetic causes of animosity often prove to be countertransference resistance; interpretation in transference, however, is viewed as profitable.	2.067810803112549
Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral agent of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children throughout the world.	2.177347937704419
Highest hospitalization rates are seen in the second and third month of life.	2.6390059534166657
Young infants, especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency, are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe RSV disease.	1.9560450493822639
Specific therapeutic options for RSV are limited.	2.4595605693476927
In this prospective study we investigated the efficacy of microcatheter spinal anaesthesia in comparison with a combined spinal-epidural technique in trauma patients.	2.4790661857282204
Background: In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy, the OPHTEL project combines clinical centers of ophthalmology and internal medicine, an institute for medical informatics and health services research, a publishing company and different industrial partners in the EDP market.	1.7052017300557272
Purpose: A prospective study was initiated for the correlation of the findings in the initial cranial CT with the long-term follow-up MRI in children with severe head injury.	2.6175949735410926
Another aim was the evaluation of frequency and location of lesions, found only in MRI.	2.4984144783767857
A differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis, patient information on avoidance of known dangers, and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected.	2.145501893808679
If no information is given on the risks inherent in a patient's condition and how she must proceed in order to ensure that they do not come about, this is considered to be a treatment error, and in these circumstances the intervention is then legally seen as bodily harm.	2.3062596135221813
Information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time, which generally means on the day before the operation.	2.1646918704035683
An exception is made to this rule for day surgery.	2.2289540016403926
The patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind.	2.2417619663049715
Such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions.	2.4781972803531223
In the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information [and making decisions].	2.040191247317952
In the case of unconscious patients everything depends on "presumable consent to the operation".	2.1320345371250493
If a patient later cites lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be unwise to refuse an operation, she must elaborate plausible grounds for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information.	1.6503484777296986
Within the last few years the use of Point-of-Care Analyzers increased.	2.7834787277901762
These testing is primarily performed in the emergency room, intensive care units, and in the operating room using small portable analyzers.	2.735647517010729
The fact of being transportable and working with rechargeable or changable batteries and disposable cartridges caused us to use blood gas analysis in the prehospital setting.	1.7791354785733324
Patients undergoing major vascular surgery frequently require a substantial intraoperative fluid replacement to assure hemodynamic stability, which is in excess of the expected fluid requirements due to starving, blood and insensible losses.	1.9170846011187903
This leads to a positive fluid balance which can not be readily explained.	2.5385935052684476
The case of a 57 year old patient is reported, who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum CK and CKMB values of 821 and 84 U/l, respectively.	2.343965694861003
The patient underwent bicycle exercise testing 9 days after a myocardial infarction in 25 W steps every 2 min starting with 50 W. The ergometry was interrupted at 125 W because of ST segment depression of 0.28 mV in V6.	1.7228978326155635
Systolic blood pressure dropped to 55 mm Hg, combined with severe angina and shock.	2.323446381771714
Volume substitution and catecholamines did not elevate blood pressure.	2.1256187790128758
Immediate M-mode and Doppler echo revealed a "stiletto"-shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency.	1.911155089201731
The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium, diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture.	2.04973277277263
Despite of shock, mitral valve replacement was performed successfully.	2.375002323018569
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction.	1.9737593726130207
The flow directed balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter introduced by Swann and Ganz 1970 has made possible the measurement of filling pressures in the heart and is extensively used in operating rooms, in catheterization laboratories and in intensive care units.	1.8762053063419861
The rupture of the pulmonary artery is an uncommon complication associated with a high mortality rate exceeding 50 percent.	2.797334692522178
Main symptoms are cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea and cardiac shock.	2.0924741691916893
Complications occur if guidelines for the safe use of the balloon-tipped catheters are not strictly followed: Excessive catheter manipulation, advancing the catheter tip too far peripherally and leaving the inflated balloon in the wedge position for long periods should be avoided.	1.851720278146118
Patients with pulmonary hypertension as well as elderly and anticoagulated patients are at greater risk.	2.60324901462901
On 90 patients with 93 unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may 1996 and april 1998, in 46 patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed.	2.1443715460106523
The diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining costal base.	2.125787261949446
After partial corporectomy and discectomy, a tricortical bone graft has been inserted.	2.077980277204305
An additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system.	2.4893582093362467
The incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal endostapler.	2.143848103944252
Controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by X-ray and CT-scan.	2.489840578301913
There was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection.	2.233396774691682
Splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures.	2.2632513686240805
This is a report of an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment of stroke, combining a stroke unit and rehabilitation in one clinic.	2.1936128698337853
This series contains unselected patients from a narrow surrounding.	2.3326728297580726
Mean age of 559 patients was 68.7 years (median 70 years).	2.149819541840344
25% of patients had an initial Barthel index of <30, 20% presented with TIA's and PRIND's.	2.12503556079285
9% suffered from cerebral hemorrhage.	2.553761750992649
The unbroken chain of care allowed a relative short length of stay in the acute care (9.4 days) without prolonging the rehabilitation phase.	2.0923872719041743
The one month mortality was 6.7%, one year mortality 18.3%.	2.1861183604517103
Discharge to a nursing home was necessary in 5.4%.	2.478610065020325
Overall more than 90% of our patients have been treated continuously in our clinic.	2.8666907413986675
Combining modern diagnostics with early onset rehabilitation seem advantageous.	2.274249473087282
About 220 knee endoprostheses are implanted at our clinic annually.	2.211005665063721
Practice has shown, however, that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments, implants, operating room staff, and surgical planning causes problems.	2.145086977592731
As a result of this, a prophylactic search for sources of error began (risk management).	2.0436502902864686
If the sources of error are found, described, and remedied, knee endoprosthetic surgery will be successful for both the patient and the surgical team.	2.227743455826699
Cooperation and communication among manufacturer, surgeon, and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks.	2.048219696455755
The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since viable pathogen has been recovered from plaques.	1.9672226265820822
Chlamydiae are epithelial pathogens notorious for causing persistent infection.	2.1204972367903387
Atherosclerosis, however, is a chronic inflammatory disease involving mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall.	2.7719986774960006
A bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the resident mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously.	1.8528564948594872
The study consists of a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	2.6552636166340258
Besides medical and sociodemographic data, two personality factors - self-efficacy and locus of control - were found to predict postoperative pain.	2.1340856343783043
Self-efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully execute the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes.	1.9819751618365289
Locus of control, in the extreme case, is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action, versus an external orientation, in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate.	2.016752529070866
We postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them.	2.1823934013573023
Inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto-oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation.	2.046826276944815
The present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen-impregnated polyester prosthesis (Dacron) in Balb/c mice on experimental days 1, 18, 38, and 322.	1.8992696420034632
Serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target.	2.2982366662784517
Specific polymer antibodies, enhanced by repeated implantations, could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day 322.	2.0873551501877188
These antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating.	2.3479041267445884
The antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete Freund's adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day 1.	1.9748751239497135
Results suggest that specific polymer antibodies, reflecting an inflammatory response, might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses.	2.0062775701799755
Twenty-nine unicondylar fractures of the distal femur were treated at the Trauma Center "Bergmannsheil", University of Bochum, Germany, between 1981 and 1994.	2.326174754588717
All patients sustained their injuries from severe direct trauma.	2.136904029148395
There were 16 lateral condylar fractures, 7 medial condylar fractures and 6 tangential posterior ("Hoffa-type") fractures.	1.8417077736258167
Twenty-eight closed injuries and 1 grade IIIB open fracture were included.	2.074691623247738
Eleven patients sustained concomitant injuries to the skeleton.	2.4316944138931156
All fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with screws within 8 h of admission.	2.4154489975578746
Postoperative management consisted of early continuous passive motion and minimal weight-bearing for 6-8 weeks, progressing to full weight-bearing.	2.1701364241349026
The mean follow-up was 68 months (18-120).	2.4059873488032695
The therapeutic outcome (clinical result, radiographs) was rated by the Neer score.	2.002164330282208
Twenty-seven patients were available for follow-up examination.	2.915310507894592
Of these, 23 were rated as excellent.	2.319503056618413
3 achieved satisfactory results, and 1 had an unsatisfactory result.	2.4626225572010862
All patients who did not achieve an excellent outcome had had accompanying injuries.	2.133769228186955
Open reduction and internal screw fixation of unicondylar femur fractures provided overall excellent long-term results.	2.249596485877014
The therapeutic outcome was significantly affected by associated injuries of the skeleton.	2.3418941378711886
The realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients, but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients.	2.1115684847774676
The global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems; stepwise mastering of these problems may help to maintain or restore an acceptably high quality of life according to the WHO guidelines for palliative medicine.	2.1084626596835903
In light of the anxiety felt by physicians and others caring for this patient group, palliative psycho-oncology must offer patient-centered holistic care in which the psycho-oncologist is not an isolated therapist but rather a member of a team made up of physicians, nurses, religious workers, psychologists, ergotherpists, physiotherapists, social workers, and especially family members.	1.814259973918414
Together, this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed.	2.0062784473978854
Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) with hepatic vein occlusion is a rare disorder that can effectively be treated in advanced stages with orthotopic liver transplantation.	2.0863691330207725
We report on 16 patients who received 18 liver grafts and were followed up for at least 2 years.	2.250376931255398
In 7 patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.	2.3644577362507504
One patient died after 4 months due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia; another patient died after 2 years due to progressive liver failure after portal vein thrombosis.	2.012824376788095
The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 87.5 % compared to 85.3 % in all other 710 orthotopic liver transplantations performed from September 1988 to December 1995 at our institution.	1.971219116678797
Anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin.	2.1982812886434218
Three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis, one patient for 1 week only early after the transplantation.	2.0458321591255086
Two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy.	2.3720744319119493
Two patients had to be retransplanted, one for thrombosis of the hepatic artery and portal vein after discontinuation of dicoumarin due to GI bleeding and one for hepatic vein thrombosis after insufficient dicoumarin intake.	2.024668798775602
Terminal BCS represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation; however, life-long, closely monitored anticoagulation is essential.	2.0068802164753916
Postmenopausal estrogen-replacement therapy maintains bone density as assessed by densitometry of skeletal sites relevant for future fracture.	1.940387255503857
Optimal doses are 2 mg oral estradiol, 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens, 1.25 mg estrone and 50 µg transdermal estradiol.	1.7561938234540868
There is a role for calcium supplementation in individuals with non-optimal dietary intake of calcium.	2.0679841108512136
Observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement reduces the future risk for hip fracture by 25 %.	2.190193429314995
Discontinuation of replacements is associated with an increase of fracture risk few years later.	2.716017458683058
It is noteworthy that there is a lack of formal fracture studies providing data on the efficacy of estrogen replacement for primary prevention of osteoporosis and for secondary prevention in terms of treatment of women with established osteoporosis, with a diagnosis based on WHO criteria.	2.311658648444907
Artificial insemination from donor (heterologous insemination) is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility.	2.1711620464634596
In this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors, the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized.	2.1091738398073328
Although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy, most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not-identifiable information on biological and social characteristics.	1.8413302925018236
Semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population.	2.4327936538475194
The decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples.	2.0548997252715036
Retrospectively, however, the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership.	2.659577416486663
The most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children.	2.018865694912825
The course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural procreation.	2.3883790730343843
They receive more love and care than "usual" children.	2.1136537230278076
Their rights concerning the insemination, however, are poorly considered.	2.605215473538611
If we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights, non-disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems.	1.975724154451997
The extended field of view imaging procedure named "SieScape" provides, for the first time, a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to 60 cm in length.	1.9291014536145026
This allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view, without having to assemble several pictures.	2.2861680832484748
Furthermore, pathological find-ings can be shown in full size in their surroundings.	2.013625962842115
This method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding, for instance a tumor, during therapy.	1.9252269941131623
Heart rate variability (HrV) has been established as an important risk parameter in patients surviving myocardial infaction.	2.42261029270507
Recently, analysis of HRV - particularly of the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) - from short term ECG recordings has been proposed as an alternative to that from 24 hour Holter monitorings.	2.027807346054105
The present study is the first to compare SDNN from short term recordings to that from 24 hour recordings with respect to risk stratification after myocardial infarction.	2.2850167138544233
In 60 patients at the time of discharge from the hospital, SDNN from Holter monitoring averaged 93  +/-  30 ms compared to 39  +/-  18 determined from short term recordings.	2.1956783657041314
Patients with a prospectively defined clinical endpoint differed significantly from those with an uneventful course with respect to age, left ventricular ejection fraction, mean RR interval from Holter recording ( 753  +/-  153 vs 921  +/-  132 ms), mean RR from short term recording (783  +/-  153 vs 914  +/-  163 ms), and SDNN from the Holter recording (71  +/-  27 vs 97  +/-  29 ms; p < 0.001) However, patients with and without clinical event could not be seperated by means of SDNN measured from short term ECG registrations (35  +/-  22 vs 41  +/-  19 ms; P = NS).	1.9649939478107024
Thus, SDNN measured from short term ECG recordings does not seem to be useful regarding risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction.	2.21091769896774
Analysis of HRV should be performed using 24 hour Holter monitoring, which provides more information and reflects circadian fluctuation in autonomic tone.	2.0574225236183086
Glomus tumors (glomangiomata) are benign tumors arising from glomus cells.	2.1040480221894287
Multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant, which is usually located subungually.	2.3514644876301922
Nonetheless multiple glomangiomata - sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature - may cause considerable discomfort.	2.012524520729913
Sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and cryosurgical therapy.	2.5424737262846855
We report on sclerotherapy in a 35 year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors.	2.20776693234085
Conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass (LVM) are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning.	1.9608356476981375
Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of LVM.	2.1335094486343777
This study was performed to compare LVM measurement by one- (1D), two- (2D), and 3D echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients (pts) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).	2.2099549225399016
Determination of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) can be performed through washout methods, indicator gas dilution or bodyplethysmography.	2.02963692875151
Some of these techniques have been adapted for use in intensive care patients whilst being mechanically ventilated.	2.5614898810169486
However, most measurement setups are bulky, cumbersome to use and their running costs are high.	1.905757943841733
Hence FRC measurement has not become a routine method in intensive care although it offers considerable advantages in the management of ventilated  patients such as the determination of "best PEEP", the detection of progressive alveolar collapse in the course of acute lung injury and during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	2.288794080514871
Up to now most efforts to improve and simplify FRC measurement were made at the expense of accuracy.	1.8974642609770889
An ideal method ought to be accurate, easy to handle and cost-effective.	2.231212100335455
It should supply not only FRC data but also information about intrapulmonary gas distribution and dead space.	1.9544930238432547
These demands can be met using modern data acquisition software.	2.1720472294743147
The pros and cons of all methods available for FRC measurement are discussed in view of their suitability for intensive care patients.	2.3118745697544116
A conventional nitrogen washout using emission spectroscopy for measurement of nitrogen concentration gives satisfying exact values for the determination  of the parameters mentioned above.	2.096824291818766
For flow measurement a normal pneumotachograph can be used.	2.7486377497701495
Using a laptop computer for data  acquisition the bed-side monitor fulfills most of the demands in intensive care.	2.094960040559455
It is then also possible to measure indices of intrapulmonary gas distribution such as Alveolar Mixing Efficiency and Lung Clearance Index.	1.8213830083874385
Three strategies are followed in handling the key issue within the field of action of care and services for the elderly: securing the material needs of those requiring care, creating appropriate care structures, and providing an effective counselling back-up to alleviate interface problems.	1.9375279697513774
Thouse latter, process-oriented aids, have been the subject of discussion and further development under the key term of case management for a good decade.	2.2762697058504346
The aim in this context is to prevent the elderly from being unnecessarily moved into residential care, to stop the revolving door syndrome, to ensure that older people can stay in their homes, to support family members acting as care providers, to enhance the quality of services and those to ease the strain on fund providers.	1.825111928310353
In the context of case managment, these diverse tasks are performed by three basic substantive functions: the gatekeeper, broker, and advocacy functions.	1.8041842943538504
Each of these three functions characterizes the main variants of case management with a different weighting (care management, community care, managed care and case management as a counselling approach with a particular focus on individual help).	1.840715185750305
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly; it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin.	2.3544865496566296
Several clinical variants of BP have been described, and we now add our observations of two BP cases mimicking subacute prurigo.	2.0789439598172343
Both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic excoriated papules for several months before presentation.	2.13548996612777
Histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis.	2.507319495503656
In the serum of both patients, indirect immunofluorescence on NaCl-separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters.	2.1658249887106775
Perilesional skin biopsies showed linear IgG or C3 deposits in the basement membran zone.	2.0263058676056223
These cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid.	2.9036441432742848
The distal metatarsal osteotomy according to Magerl allows correction of a hallux valgus deformity by lateral and plantar displacement as well as by pronation and varisation.	2.0811588833271726
The length of the first metatarsal can be adjusted by the depth of the cut at the resection or by a slightly oblique osteotomy.	2.2547331805794792
If necessary, soft tissue release and/or a osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx can be done to relocate the sesamoids under the head of the first metatarsal.	2.571199565020216
A review of 118 foot operations in 75 patients demonstrated a very good or good result in about 75 %.	2.1201248783856044
Radiological examination showed sufficient lateralisation of the metatarsal head.	2.236992043965296
Evaluating the length of the first metatarsal and the amount of variation, the results were less satisfying.	2.968009120221686
The sophisticated operative procedure limits the use of this technique as a standard procedure.	2.8524072410705217
The contribution of Rudolf Virchow to dermatology seems to have been forgotten, or present-day dermatologists are not aware of it.	1.933468173859922
The report encompasses a short biography, including Virchow's nonmedical activities.	2.0426945267160446
It starts with early experimental publications, which laid to the foundation for his fame, and with dermatological studies of his early period.	1.8972673214431355
This is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work, "Cellularpathologie".	1.9404996627141438
Special mention is made of Virchow's lasting contributions to medical, and particularly dermatological, terminology.	2.014580408063655
Finally, his historical studies, his latter small publications on topics in dermatology, his pupils and scientific friends, and the social-political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed.	1.8743366600088258
Thus, a multifaceted picture is painted of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways.	1.8359383400474347
Starter's pistols are often bought for self-defense, but can also be used for criminal activities (e.g.	2.235000758003697
assaults, etc.).	2.5323059550717257
When a starter's pistol is loaded with blank cartridges and is fired, a powerful shooting noise results.	1.8442713218706508
The level of the noise produced is high enough to cause acoustic trauma.	2.248035822570203
For legal examinations and giving an expert opinion further information is needed about the power of such noise.	2.03716261942598
We examined how high peak sound pressure levels were of the gunshots of blank cartridges and whether there existed any directional characteristics from the noise emissions.	1.8380342769360278
In all, 15 different models of starter's pistols of 8 different calibres were examined.	1.9430797129555337
In addition to blank cartridges, 8 mm tear gas cartridges were also examined.	1.975630792005689
Four transducers were situated in the horizontal plane around the muzzle: 0 ° (shooting direction), 45 °, 90 °, and 180 ° (towards the firer).	1.8876664412830921
The distances between the transducers and the muzzle were 25 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm.	1.9626293189332862
At a distance of 1 m and in the 0 ° shooting direction the peak sound pressure levels of nearly all weapons tested exceeded 160 dB.	2.048535199654059
At a shooting distance of 25 cm the peak sound pressure levels reached 181 dB.	2.012572417473741
In addition, we observed a directional characteristic concerning the emission of noise: pistols produced higher peak sound pressure levels to the front than backwards towards the firer.	1.8087620071981225
Owing to their rare incidence, foreign body injuries in the region of the orbit, skull base and skull have up to now mostly been treated in  the literature by means of case reports.	2.5077148988252533
Here we present our experience and treatment regimen for ten patients we have treated during the last 3 years.	2.497525287467343
In seven cases the foreign body was located in the orbit alone, whereas in three others the orbit and the frontal base were equally involved.	2.1146365343226305
Three patients suffered from partial or complete loss of vision and one patient developed a psychosyndrome during the follow-up period, but no late effects were registered in the remaining six cases.	2.35857336723041
Before removing the foreign body and carefully reconstructing the accident, however, we strongly recommend the documentation of possible functional deficits, preferably by means of photography.	2.4046099813884707
CT is the method of choice for localising the foreign body, except for the depiction of wood particles.	2.315799419560926
Here, sonography and MR should be performed.	2.479035217370249
As the therapeutic approach, the cooperation of an interdisciplinary team of ophthalmogists, neuro- and maxillofacial surgeons seems mandatory.	2.0711671748035885
To avoid inflammation, the immediate removal of the foreign material is recommended in cases with considerable intracranial lesions: post-operative neurologic and intensive care monitoring should be provided.	2.3492572285904294
Treatment is completed by high-dose antibiotics, using CSF-soluble substances and, if necessary, anti-convulsives.	2.319075183725284
Rocuronium is a new nondepolarizing muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described.	2.419915693537088
The goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery.	1.846831074266621
These operations, which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to "share" the patient's airway, require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments.	1.9447565170115633
In addition, the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed.	2.537273672144308
Patients and methods: In order to better define the potential advantages and risks of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), we designed a prospective study including 73 eyes.	2.2363838991841085
Treatment of tachycardic atrial fibrillation (AF) is difficult in patients with congestive heart failure because many drugs which exert negative dromotropic effects (beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists) may depress ventricular contractility and/or decrease arterial blood pressure.	2.127198381342145
We have identified 2 intravascular sites in the superior (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) where parasympathetic nerves, which innervate the atrioventricular node, can be stimulated electrically.	1.926897940202106
In 8 dogs, a 7-F catheter with an expandable electrode basket at its tip was non-fluoroscopically positioned in the SVC and in the proximal IVC (time for positioning: 3-5 minutes).	2.0252075638576996
High-frequency electrical parasympathetic stimulation (PS) with 20 Hz at an impulse duration of 0.1 ms was performed during pacing induced AF.	1.8112500434502419
Results: With increasing stimulus strength, a graded ventricular rate slowing was observed during PS in the SVC and IVC (P<0.01, ANOVA).	1.961791233049899
The negative dromotropic effect started instantaneously after onset of PS and ceased immediately after termination of PS.	2.0354790633500164
During ventricular pacing at a constant rate, no decrease of the arterial blood pressure was observed during PS.	2.5434174151789923
PS in the IVC yielded significantly lower stimulation thresholds than in the SVC.	2.484228480995075
Conclusions: Transvenous parasympathetic stimulation for ventricular rate control during AF can easily be achieved in the SVC and IVC in dogs.	2.108911711864993
This procedure may provide a foundation for investigating the usefulness of PS in humans.	2.1151760004155964
If the results translate to patients, PS may be very beneficial in the treatment of AF in patients with congestive heart failure.	2.4347953563999734
A total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months (12-98).	2.401749507152655
Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively.	2.405089691191851
According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting.	2.253729208863593
The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program.	2.1907959393021623
All fractures in the conservative group were of type A.	2.726121810077752
Charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage 4 of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) which is known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease since 1886.	1.8348296491586542
This entity, which can be subdivided into 3 groups including subgroups, predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly.	2.125770998651924
The first symptom, often unnoticed by the patient for a long period, is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer-toe formation and mobile pes cavus.	2.1044337761025362
Progredient atrophy of the peroneal, extensor, tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus excavatus with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot, secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment.	1.9974627554407087
Permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive microtrauma (stage 5 of HMSN).	2.2175065586454465
The alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal architectur is imitated by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells.	2.3180243870884
The first description, based on six cases, was published in 1986 by Yousem and Hochholzer.	2.094240957495094
From their ultrastructural findings they presumed a type II pneumocytes differentiation of the epithelial cells.	2.2297369046781834
We investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung immunhistochemical by means of antibodies against apoprotein B and C of human surfactant.	2.31634479002303
The septal connection tissue cells did not react.	2.2487339762853895
These findings confirm the expression of surfactant constituants and, hence, the differentiation into type II pneumocytes of the epithelial cells of the alveolar adenoma.	2.189199437267532
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women, whereas it is rare in men.	2.641859698669576
In our own case series the ratio is 175 : 1.	2.1498241122015544
The present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of 54 de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from 1978 to 1996 and a comparative discussion of 528 female breast cancers from the same geographic area.	1.9330164509091217
We should like to focus on the following observations:	2.7668320846076853
Patients with congenital varicella syndrome develop cicatricial skin lesions and microphthalmia.	2.11826085978987
An overlap in the clinical manifestations exist with a specific genetic disorder, called MIDAS syndrome.	2.2088615105101232
It is due to a partial deletion of the short arm from chromosome X, with consecutive monosomy Xp22.3.	2.312390102504403
The rapid development of recombinant DNA technology and our enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of human disease has facilitated the development of new molecular therapeutic modalities, termed gene therapy.	2.1784037213715717
Currently, an increasing number of gene therapy strategies are being investigated in experimental and clinical trials.	2.4178188013646653
Despite substantial progress, a number of technical and logistical hurdles must still be overcome before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the human patient.	2.1445203293143886
Since gene therapy involves complex cell processing and can be time consuming and costly, simplifications or even alternative approaches will be necessary in order to establish this therapy as suitable for clinical use.	2.1454720636211158
This report reviews various gene therapy stategies and gene delivery techniques currently under clinical or experimental investigation.	1.8755579157224305
Special emphasis is given to cytokine gene therapy using gene-modified tumor vaccines for cancer treatment.	1.9083396718301462
Using the PTB simulator, which emits real signals from patients, we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard).	1.8736400223716219
For this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial pulsewave, cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of 20 patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator.	1.8658627052256667
The invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.	2.026267892973248
The invasive system showed a cut-off frequency of 35 Hz; the damping constant was 0.21.	2.0412949564122425
From a total of 49 bio-signals from patients the Dinamap 1846 was able to process 41 signals and the HP M-1008B 47 signals.	2.0089570803234658
The mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to -2.50 mmHg, 3.35 mmHg (P<0.05) and 1.51 mmHg with the Dinamap 1846 and to -8.5 mmHg (P<0.001), -5.15 mmHg (P<0.001) and -5.58 mmHg (P<0.001) for the HP M-1008B.	2.03724875590278
The 95% confidence limit for the systolic, diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to 56 mmHg, 30 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the Dinamap 1846 and 50 mmHg, 38 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the HP M-1008B.	1.812936417492305
The differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different artefact detection and elimination techniques.	2.195477915572615
The results of the performance tests we achieved with the PTB simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations.	2.294509183164393
The American Association for the Advanecement of Medical Instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of 5 +/- 8 mmHg.	2.1625924800868885
None of the examined instruments lay within these limits.	2.2135604682673327
Due to the systematic and stochastic errors, we think that the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard) do not achieve performance levels that are adequate for measuring critically ill patients.	1.7501676891692477
Many patients consulting medical emergency services make the initial contact because of psychiatric emergency situations.	1.95246523465836
However, emergency physicians and their assistants are usually not sufficiently experienced in psychiatry.	2.067490215420204
Therefore, psychiatric emergencies are sometimes only reluctantly accepted or inadequately treated by these services.	1.9253166385122178
Our present contribution aims at improving this situation.	2.2409196847123822
It gives a review of the main diagnostic groups concerned, their symptomatology and psychopathology, and offers some advice with regard to empathic verbal interventions and counselling in those emergency situations.	2.0962184631849006
3 different types of complex spinal trauma are defined: Type I means a multilevel contiguous or non contiguous unstable injury, type II is described as a spinal injury with concommitant thoracic or abdominal lesion, typ III stands for the coincidence of spinal injury and polytrauma.	1.8917843132171692
Overlapping of different types occurs.	2.8108736652310182
Type I: The incidence amounts according a german multicenter study to about 2,5 %.	2.1674663204947464
Multilevel injuries need to be stabilized for a long distance from posterior.	2.669405000258722
With a thoroughful analysis the segments to be fused are determined.	2.16975727160588
A CT scan of the thorax during the first diagnostic screening is recommended.	2.475268778084578
Early reduction and stabilization from posterior should be aimed at.	2.3402532878409525
During the first two weeks anterior procedures are contraindicated.	2.329918352739722
Abdominal injuries are to be found in 3-4 % of all spinal injuries.	2.944783712429564
All organs could be affected.	2.5897700156862395
A typical constallation is the "seat-belt syndrome" with lesions of the upper abdominal organs and a flexiondistraction injury of the upper lumbar spine.	2.4165100046725136
The main problem is to make the diagnosis of both components initially.	2.684445817500626
The prognosis of this combination is favorable.	2.3604895678417543
Typ III: In 17-18 % of all polytraumatized patients lesions of the spine are to be diagnosed.	2.5506942694097225
From these only one third need surgical care.	2.270112497694723
From 680 patients with operatively treated fractures of the thoracolumbar junction 6,2 % were polytraumatized according to the multicenter study mentioned above.	2.3766863791691746
The risk of missing a spinal injury in polytrauma totals approximately 20 %.	2.032263867069515
Surgical stabilization should be performed in the primary phase (day-1-surgery).	2.8432755100404683
Additional injuries, potentially time consuming operations with a high blood loss sometimes necessitate a different approach.	2.292297652131036
Non stabilized spinal injuries apparently do not have the same negative effect on the whole organism as long bone fractures.	2.2103129668537638
In the early phase of treatment on the C-spine only anterior procedures and on the thoraco-lumbar spine only posterior techniques should be applied.	2.2011934707796774
Experimental studies have shown that in traffic accidents with frontal impact the new airbag system can significantly reduce the incidence of severe injuries and fatal outcome.	2.2440380418655352
The question of whether the airbag itself induces specific patterns of injury needs further investigation.	1.939826732034509
Two cases of traffic accidents with airbag protection are presented here.	2.1340132829921545
The first case report clearly shows the life-saving and injury-reducing effect of the airbag system in a traffic accident with frontal impact at 100 km/h.	1.968317298785629
In the second case only minor injuries of the face were diagnosed initially.	2.3600828116256234
Hemodynamic instability occurred after 3 h of hospitalization due to rupture of the azygos vein.	2.2939623242050726
Analysis of the presented cases shows that, besides the well-known benefits, there are certain injury patterns that seem to be related to the use of airbags.	2.6265175665454614
These have not been described before.	2.828490759786309
It is concluded that patients who were involved in traffic accidents with airbag deployment have to be hospitalized and followed up carefully over time, even though they are initially stable, as potentially fatal sequelae of deceleration trauma can occur later.	2.001625962602632
In our opinion it is not possible to estimate the severity of airbag-associated injuries with conventional methods.	2.536186725179795
A questionnaire with 78 questions concerning the situation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) sufferers in Germany was distributed to a representative 3000 out of the more than 14000 patient members of the German AS society; 1614 patients (54%) responded.	2.015238138560342
The age distribution of these patients roughly agrees with that expected due to the distribution of the age at diagnosis and the age distribution of the German population.	2.9168288949901062
The group of patients more than 65 years old is, however, under-represented.	2.606796508978784
Introduction: Headache is thought to be generated by nociceptive processes within the meninges, followed by activation of trigeminal neurons within the brainstem.	2.1797493370129852
The noxious stimuli initially involved in these nociceptive processes are unknown.	2.1163408451825685
A preparation was developed in the barbiturate-anesthetized rat, in which the activation of trigeminal brain stem neurons by selective local stimulation of the dura mater could be observed.	2.1429491056348575
Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall, dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors.	2.331049619139587
There are probably several candidate genes, that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis.	2.119136242494806
In recent years, a growing number of gene polymorphisms, associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction, has been identified.	2.7203421820357137
These genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism, regulation of blood pressure and clotting.	2.150376086681048
In contrast to rare monogenetic diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms (e.g.	2.06271180107369
familial hypercholesterolemia), genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent.	2.2675956255609515
Due to their frequency, there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease.	2.1936435713807483
Genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle, environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders.	1.9292574579459514
Fourty-nine patients with 50 complex acetabular fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation from August 1993 to February 1996 in a prospectively documented study.	2.1718944585391147
The fractures were fixed with small fragment implants through a modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland approach).	1.8667727606841211
Thirty-seven patients were polytraumatized with an ISS of 20 pts.	2.100095377971192
In 10 patients the ISS was > 25 pts.	2.1973476481663403
Good or anatomic initial fracture reduction with a fragment stepoff K 2 mm could be achieved in 48 fracturers (96 %).	1.9357941913552548
Thirty-six patients with 37 fractures could be evaluated after 25 months on average.	2.069351805503236
In 28 fractures (76 %) the functional outcome was good or excellent according to the d'Aubigne and Harris scores.	2.368890411825703
Radiological results were excellent in 21 fractures (57 %) and satisfactory in 12 fractures (Heeg score).	2.0738836151166375
In 7 cases (14 %) a postoperative subcutaneous seroma had to be treated surgically.	2.4479900461794877
No wound infections, however, were observed.	3.289443167255704
Further complications were secondary a loss of reduction in 4 cases (11 %), relevant heterotopic ossifications (Brooker III/IV) in 5 cases (14 %), and aseptic femoral head necrosis in 2 cases (5 %).	2.3713617715946316
In two cases a total hip replacement (THR) for posttraumatic arthritis had to be performed.	2.26732199074558
Two more cases are scheduled for THR due to symptomatic femoral head necrosis.	2.1018142113223015
A good joint reconstruction can be achieved through the modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland) in complex fractures of the acetabulum.	2.2813088720110377
However, the approach related morbidity seems to be worrysome.	2.508680661575833
In complex fractures with comminution in the roof of the acetabulum the prognosis remains uncertain even in cases where initial anatomic joint reconstruction can be achieved.	2.090328013938986
The discussion on the results of open spinal surgery, in particular, on complications as a result of open surgery, e. g., the so-called post-discotomy syndrome, has led to the development of less invasive methods, especially for treatment of lumbar disc prolapses.	2.6639736505363523
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are based on a variety of intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal spinal disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis.	2.568995959537867
Since the 1970 s, various methods such as mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and, in part, endoscopic intradiscal procedures have been developed and also used clinically.	2.039179677515043
The clinical results vary from 30 % good/very good results to almost 100 % good/very good results, depending on the author and study.	2.05104661911603
It is obvious that not many prospective randomized studies using either conservatively or surgically treated control groups have been conducted.	1.9717567644221108
The results of these studies on intradiscal therapy methods are often analyzed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospective studies of a single method, which often have large case numbers, but do not always meet the demanding criteria for scientific study design.	1.8253010552310196
To attain good results, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only be used to treat select cases of lumbar disc disorders according to strict indication criteria.	2.4107369345715477
At the present time it can be concluded that, in comparison to endoscopic und microsurgical methods, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be restricted to a small number of cases.	2.3963077582903227
A 58 year old patient with hepatitis virus C (HCV) infection had a secondary polyclonal IgG-IgM cryoglobulinemia with a benign 20 year course.	1.987020778518111
Clincally the patient suffered from progressive pigmented purpura (PPP).	2.25496231772333
Histologic evaluation revealed a lymphocytic vasculitis.	2.5067181869067965
Food containing tartrazine trig- gered flares of the PPP, as demonstrated with controlled oral provocation testing.	1.8154455018564322
In most of the previously described cases of HCV and type III cryoglobulinemia, the typical cutaneus finding was palpable purpura with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.	1.9941435705669806
Normal aging is associated with changes in body composition, thirst perception, renal function, and the hormonal regulatory systems involved in the maintenance of water and sodium balance.	2.406627385831976
The presence of many diseases and drugs common in the elderly can interact with the impaired homeostatic systems to result in clinically significant disturbances of water and sodium with accompanying symptoms, morbidity, and mortality.	1.9396168572953107
These disorders, which include dehydration, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, urinary frequency, and urinary incontinence can either be prevented or promptly recognized and appropriately treated by understanding the physiological changes and clinical circumstances which put the elderly person at increased risk for deranged water and sodium balance.	1.7967143205167528
Although valvular stenosis may be evaluated adequately by measuring transvalvular pressure gradients with Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, these methods have failed to provide reliable and accurate quantification of valvular regurgitation.	1.8808349979982053
In recent years the development of magnetic resonance imaging has broadened the diagnostic spectrum in cardiology, since it allows assessment of ventricular volumes without geometrical assumptions and the non-invasive quantification of blood flow within the heart and great vessels.	2.302670210657895
The purpose of this overview is to evaluate "established" diagnostic tools and to show the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of valvular heart disease.	2.301312594352101
Solvent induced polyneuropathy and encephalopathy have been acknowledged quite recently as occupational diseases in Germany.	2.020690107511767
For compensation first of all the diagnosis has to be proven.	2.7679334888021625
For differential diagnosis other known causes as well as non-organic mental diseases must be taken into consideration.	2.34550088710817
The causality between proven exposures and diagnosed disease has at least to be probable.	1.9866468043897556
To evaluate causation extensive experience of the experts is needed.	2.297530759761684
In this context scientific criteria regarding neurotoxicity of the solvent, duration of exposure, individual aspects of non-occupational influences, time course of the disease are important within a thorough synoptic evaluation.	2.0738629893668854
Possibilities and limitations of sensitive diagnostic measures such as neurographic, neuropsychologic and neuroimaging examinations are discussed.	2.054707303632642
The prognosis of toxic polyneuropathy and encephalopathy is in general favorable if exposure has stopped.	1.9658248069714896
Additionally, adequate therapy and rehabilitation measures are supportive for a good prognosis.	2.203482329723457
Standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine.	2.4636415276007737
Spondylosis deformans, osteochondrosis and uncovertebral arthrosis are well depicted by such images.	1.9712912955973432
Whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms.	2.6962738176008747
Special projections (anteroposterior oblique radiographs, lateral radiographs in flexion and extension) may be the next step.	2.210840580714842
For many abnormalities, mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon, MR imaging has become the standard procedure, largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution.	2.1034728480631877
CT can be used instead of MR imaging if the latter method is not available, and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities.	2.453223565186715
Scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for MR imaging or CT. Myelograms and myelo-CT can no longer be considered routine imaging methods.	2.095403080683667
A number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context.	2.4471121638205005
We report on three years of experience with a new method of a simultaneous endoscopically assisted anterior release in the prone position, combined with transpedicular posterior scoliosis correction and fixation.	2.010637979862685
In 60 cases this simultaneous approach yielded substantial advantages.	2.1290183414855695
True derotation of the apex - even in the thoracic spine - is achieved.	2.4026578927316393
In cases of total canalicular occlusion or the total absence of the lacrimal apparatus the functional restoration requires the repair of a newly created lacrimal system.	2.046008137858367
The intraoperatively reestablisted lacrimal drainage from the conjunctival sac will be maintained by a plastic tube.	2.0122822984068147
Beside other criteria the influence of the used inserted materials polyethylene or silicone should be evaluated.	2.32723650737302
A prospective, randomized and controlled trial is conducted to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting in high grade symptomatic carotid artery stenoses.	1.9023704944641733
Magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines.	1.995265130576961
However, the patient is exposed to static as well as to time-dependent magnetic fields and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.	2.619746124841295
In 1997 the Strahlenschutzkommission, the German Radiological Protection Commission, passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics.	2.2413522764865874
In this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given.	1.8236866334830297
In the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed, as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields, the gradient fields and the radio-frequency fields.	2.0105352755576402
Additionally, advice is given for the protection of high-risk patients, personnel, and the general public, together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers.	2.5913813800509358
Granuloma faciale is known to be difficult to treat.	3.0345639180735473
Cryosurgery is an effective and minimally invasive therapy for this granulomatous inflammation of the skin.	2.6142908126980084
It should be considered as an alternative to dapsone.	3.5485193026353876
The results of early conversion of war fractures by the application of AO osteosynthesis in A group (n = 32) of the injuried, were compared with B group (n = 187) of injuried, treated definitely with external fixator.	2.2267771341204545
There were statistical evaluations and X-ray observations of healing in both groups, as well as the appearances of the most frequent complications such as: Pintract infection, osteitis, pseudoarthrosis and reoperation.	2.531670103064835
Statistically less significant appearance of complications in A group during 2th and 6th month (p < 0.001) was observed.	2.2016874172081873
In 12th month of observation, these differences statistically disappeared.	2.1325085638413848
Healing observed by X-ray in 2th, 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups.	2.268492941921478
Since 1993, 30 patients with acute intraarticular distal radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	2.213307447121266
In 12 patients (40%) concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed.	2.6203282905845695
According to Geissler we found grade I-tear in one patient, grade II in three, grade III in six and grade IV in two patients.	2.082936882660457
The eight individuals with grade III-and IV-lesions additionally revealed marked instablity intraoperatively.	2.038483721539933
Therefore, operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and scaphocapitate arthrodesis.	2.010083902265094
Seven patients out of this group (87.5%) were followed up clinically and radiologically 3 years postoperatively, on average.	2.2949227472605953
Clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability.	2.138071302338057
Objective grip strength was measured using a Jamar tester and compared to the contralateral wrist.	2.547511872664099
Radiological evaluation consisted of the posteroanterior and lateral view as well as stress views in radial and ulnar deviation.	2.3036800211902437
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and Cooney scoring system as well as the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	2.0946437856136617
According to Gartland, 100% of our patients showed an excellent result; these rates were 86% using the Jakim score and 60% using the Cooney scoring system.	1.923331846769188
According to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result.	2.702620251991726
Open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard.	2.2919463349665885
But arthroscopic techniques show also good and comparable results.	2.261300956264159
Arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases.	2.2990572971112333
Therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization.	2.018367566278964
This prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization.	2.601689944228918
In 1991 the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest with Doppler sonography was accepted by the Medical Council of the Bundesaerztekammer as one of the methods able to shorten the waiting time for fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of cerebral death.	2.1374708942597787
A survey was undertaken to determine how frequently Doppler sonography has been used since that time in certifying brain death.	2.1066943905329865
A total of 400 questionnaires were sent out to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.	1.8586827514736426
In all, 226 questionnaires were returned.	2.203463748208333
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography has been used to certify brain death, mostly combined with other methods.	2.2762658054632294
The question of whether false positive results have been observed was answered five times in the affirmative.	2.1126221983604108
In order to indicate pitfalls, the examiners reported borderline situations which in part did not fulfil the prerequisites.	1.8627365035962014
Doppler sonography for the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest has been used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments in Germany as an additional confirmatory test and rather seldom as the only method to shorten the waiting period.	2.282472576634223
We report on a 64-year-old man who died within 1 h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency.	2.2040895445811928
Autopsy showed as cause of death a clinically unknown coagulase-negative staphylococci-induced left-sided endocarditis with perforation of the aortic and mitral valve.	2.1579860587798323
The macroscopic appearance and histological findings are presented and discussed.	2.474338317639198
Thrombolysis therapy in childhood and adolescence has brought about numerous case reports, but no controlled studies over dosage and duration of therapy have been published to date.	2.3694765208687385
Laserotoscopes are suitable for low-pain outpatient surgery of otitis media with effusion (OME) under topical anesthesia.	2.0317757395936487
Comparison by skin epiluminescent microscopy of 60 malignant melanomas and 130 junctional and compound naevocellular naevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 characteristics.	1.8675161764790729
The following microscopical in vivo signs that can be defined by histopathological examination were found only in malignant or premalignant melanocytic lesions: digitated radial streaming, greyish-blue reticular patterns, opaque gypseous alabaster lacunas, brown/black dots on a blue/greyish background, pseudopodia at the periphery and blue-in-pink areas.	1.6561141915229503
Nevertheless, specific epiluminescent phenomena of histopathologically defined malignant melanomas are still unknown.	1.9688397837203493
Therefore, diagnostic evaluation of malignancy is based mainly on microscopic assessment of combined details of morphology and colour of melanocytic tumours.	1.9932629600068907
The present study examines the relationship between different psychological variables (including anxiety, depression, locus of control, expectations of pain intensity and social support) and postoperative pain, analgesic consumption and satisfaction with the pain management in a study sample of 67 patients.	2.0035159247608454
The study comprised six girls and five boys.	2.2085575987548487
All presented with congenital heart disease.	2.7500789235666496
Eight had bilateral choanal atresia.	2.566433370728523
Coloboma affecting either one or both eyes was detected in nine children.	2.3119866156962687
Nine patients suffered abnormal pinnae or deafness.	2.2696644272443023
In addition to major abnormalities, further anomalies of the orofacial region and the upper airways occurred in all patients.	2.1309045828393365
Three patients had cleft lip and palate.	2.292852636809352
Both micrognathia and high-arched palate were present in two patients.	2.5765741725609317
Facial palsy was observed in six patients.	2.9789331095244305
Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate specialities.	2.1921386901933486
The anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible.	2.302200120839206
In our experience, the transpalatal approach is far more satisfactory than the transnasal.	2.0177030767235404
It gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair.	2.191148967708906
After the child has grown stronger, a long-term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training.	2.2412490837125016
Thrilling are especially those situations, when people have to make ethical decisions.	2.125533276412489
Issues of medical ethics crop up not only in hospital series, but often in genres where this subject is hardly to be supposed: comedies, westerns, love stories and gangster movies.	1.7907010806204486
Enacting these conflicts means offering a solution, and in doing so films refer to moral values and - at the same time - function as seismographs for the social relevance of bioethical topics.	2.0118278149355455
But it is possible that ethical principles of good decision-making fall victims to the drama of the story.	2.150072722006287
Analysis of the portrayed conflict is similar to a case discussion in bioethics and represents a helpful adjunct to the procurement of analytical and communicative competences.	1.8105659330541932
Several experimental studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrate a decrease of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.	2.052185983156264
Proliferation or clonogenic tumor cells most likely is the major mechanism underlying this phenomenon.	2.1905955161575763
Important progress in radiation oncology might therefore be expected from inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment.	1.993366804961139
Possibilities to minimize the time factor are briefly discussed.	2.4784014999329687
Inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by inhibition of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation, or by pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis are scientifically interesting but currently not proven to be effective to counteract the loss of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment of fractionated irradiation.	1.860566152449473
At present, the only established approach is to complete radiotherapy within a short overall treatment time, e. g. by accelerated fractionation and by prevention or compensation of unscheduled treatment gaps.	1.9733285653868875
Technical innovations and software improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution sonography (US) have definitely influenced the diagnostic imaging of rheumatic diseases.	2.158812306715437
For MRI, improvements in surface coils, dedicated low-field systems (0.2 T), and software improvements (shorter acquisition times and refinements of fat suppressing techniques) must be mentioned.	2.084523410826647
For sonography, the main innovations concern the development of higher transducer frequencies (7-15 Mhz) and power Doppler imaging.	2.235151454062973
Clinical evaluations have shown that MRI and US are most useful in cases of suspected rheumatic disease with negative plain film radiographs and for documenting the course of the disease, diagnosing of early rheumatoid arthritis, making a differential diagnosis in clinically unclear rheumatic diseases, investigating vascularization, and quantifying pannus formation.	2.118135813014747
In order to improve diagnostic efficacy the role of MRI and US in the management of patients with rheumatic disease should be reconsidered.	2.5714379874504982
In addition to renal elimination and gastrointestinal metabolism (amylase; splenic and hepatic dextranase) colloid plasma solutions like dextran and hydroxyethyl starch deposit in tissues, especially in the reticuloendothelial system (RES).	1.7446371106212928
This tissue storage is limited in time (weeks to months), is influenced by the employed solution and other factors (lysosomes) and has usually no clinical importance (no RES blockade).	2.0191287875469675
We report here a case study of a patient with sepsis (lung, liver and kidney failure) who had an overload of the RES with colloids while being treated with dextran (molecular weight 40000 and 70000 daltons) and hydroxyethyl starch (mw 450000 daltons, molar substitution 0,7).	1.7703184285823255
In the late seventies and early eighties the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) became epidemic among young menstruating women.	1.8671703159128397
A strong correlation was found between TSS and the rising popularity of hyperabsorbent tampons.	2.072267085067504
Exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus is seen as the main mediator of TSS in controlled clinical trials.	2.1582013740548383
Menstrual and nonmenstrual forms of TSS are differentiated.	2.3027391868637626
The nonmenstrual form is comparatively rare and has a high rate of mortality rate.	2.6214079066300533
Several studies showed that the overall incidence of menstrual and nonmenstrual TSS is approximately 1-3 cases per 100 000 persons.	2.2016784045816484
The leading symptoms are fever, hypotension, mucous membrane hyperemia, diffuse rashes, myalgias, vomiting and diarrhea.	1.9206581409150427
The severe form of the syndrome leads to multiorgan dysfunction.	2.4256919234569865
The streptococcal TSS (STSS) caused by group A Streptococci is clinically similar to the staphylococcal TSS.	1.9982916978815437
Both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci produce the exotoxin TSST-1.	2.053632920982739
New methods allow the detection of TSST-1 production.	2.5214623365297193
However, due to the low incidence of TSS, this method of detection has not yet been taken up in the routine diagnostic procedures.	2.5700387507316176
This report focusses on the emergence and spread of S. aureus with special clinical and epidemiological significance.	2.054156280640695
Results from typing MRSA originating from different clinical sources in all Germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the mecA gene to clonal groups of S. aureus which have been until now sensitive.	1.848537256516933
These newly emerging MRSA are still sensitive to a number of other antibiotics.	2.3912156156619253
This results in less broad resistance phenotypes of currently disseminated MRSA.	2.0465490164540263
Worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by S. aureus possessing secC and not tst.	2.1264473602516385
Background: For cataract surgery in this country retro- and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method.	2.292602504869698
It totally stops eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain.	2.757240869926644
Especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications, but the potential risks can be severe.	2.4879117275084477
In the past sponge anesthesia could not be used on patients with difficult cataract surgery due to the insufficient anesthetic effect.	2.517536766335115
A modified anesthetic method is demonstrated for complicated cataract surgery.	2.212841266863428
In patients with coronary artery disease, it is controversial whether cardiac arrhythmias result from acute subendocardial ischemia.	2.47401629063071
The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia.	2.216989617474498
The immunopathogenesis of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated.	2.1902838956961674
Therefore, the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area.	2.5183993574788595
We report the case of an 8 year old boy with a rare congenital myopathy (with cytoplasmic inclusions bodies) and clinical signs of rigid-spine-syndrome.	2.0652670657334333
During treatment of lung tuberculosis disordered breathing with hypoventilation during REM-sleep, hypoxemia and persistent hypercapnia during daytime were found.	1.855862184514941
This complication in myopathies is caused by weakness of respiratory muscles and leads to negative features (like pulmonary hypertension, daytime-sleepiness, growth failure or further impairement of the muscle disease).	1.9301045235374545
Diagnostic steps in disorders of breathing during sleep in children with neuromuscular disease are shown.	2.261862223339609
Aortic dissection with no entry or false lumen flow was recently identified as intramural hemorrhage of the aortic wall (IMH).	1.9715737905161146
Analysis of the literature revealed 209 cases of in vivo diagnosed IMH reflecting 17% of all dissections, whereas in autoptic studies this condition is found in 4-13%.	2.168250434840443
Transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and aortography (to rule out dissection) have been applied for diagnosing IMH in 57, 49, 43 and 38% of the cases, respectively.	2.218630517765205
However, diagnostic accuracy of each modality is not available to date.	2.3060554633543546
In 34%, IMH involves the ascending aorta (type A).	2.2518138601160227
The average age of patients with IMH ranges between 55 and 65 years; 65% are males.	2.3830239345017694
In 12%, IMH was associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.	2.4554787240918157
With 87%, arterial hypertension is the predominant risk factor for IMH irrespective of its location.	2.2538365542245296
As suggested by the term "mediastinal apoplexy" IMH may - similar to cerebral apoplexy - result from hypertensive rupture of the vasa vasorum in the aortic media.	1.967643343920822
With 97%, the majority of patients present with acute chest or back pain similar to classic dissection.	2.305932851557103
Mediastinal widening is found in 83%; signs of hemothorax/pleural effusion are present in 38%, acute aortic regurgitation in 26%, pericardial effusion in 23%, acute neurologic deficits in 12%, and pulse deficits in 5%.	1.8817710256588795
In 18%, IMH progresses to dissection and in another 15% to rupture.	2.209974138341102
The 30-day mortality of IMH is 24% (36% with type A and 12% with type B IMH; p<0.05).	2.019392045721739
With surgical repair, mortality of type A IMH is lowered to 18% compared to 60% with medical treatment (p<0.01).	2.17538941485828
In contrast, with 8% mortality associated with medical treatment, prognosis of type B IMH is more favorable without surgical intervention, the latter associated with a 30-day mortality of 33% (p<0.05).	2.2096227133540403
Thus, IMH is a potential precursor of dissection and should be managed like dissection with undelayed surgical intervention in patients with type A IMH and with medical treatment in type B IMH.	2.4210929615383363
We report on 3 exemplary case studies of patients with myelomeningocele who are under regular care in our outpatient clinic, and discuss the clinical and diagnostic problems and the therapeutic concept of fractures in patients with myelomeningocele.	2.560876171497353
Our case reports are in accordance to previous publications; they show that signs of confined and systemic infection and variable X-ray signs with often extensive reactive formation of callus make the diagnosis of fractures in myelomeningocele patients difficult.	1.9945121665929546
Fractures often occur without pain or trauma.	2.3605120359366256
Background: Since the end of the 1960ies, accidents have been identified as the most common cause of mortality in children and account for considerable childhood morbidity in industrialized western countries.	2.459701710678482
In contrast to traffic-related accidents in older children and adolescents, which were consequently registered and documented, no epidemiological data exist about home injuries and accidents during the first years of life in Germany.	2.0906144310904433
This report presents data on accident-related hospitalizations in a cohort of 10271 infants, who participated in a prospective vaccine efficacy trial in Germany from 1991 to 1994.	1.9785224266660537
One-hundred-thirty patients underwent 53 electrophysiological studies including programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation and 96 atrial overdrive stimulations on an outpatient basis.	1.867032216013745
The indications for electrophysiological study were disabling palpitation, syncope, or presyncope, intracardiac conduction disturbance, and bradyarrhythmia.	1.825604164799133
In one patient the efficacy of oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated by repeat electrophysiological study.	2.391368544350723
Atrial overdrive stimulation was performed in patients with atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia.	3.086901043076728
On the basis of the result of electrophysiological testing, 25 patients were believed not to require any treatment, 16 patients received new drug therapy, 7 patients underwent catheter ablation in a second session, 2 patients had either a pacemaker or an ICD implanted, and 1 patient continued to receive the drug therapy that had been tested.	1.9812582402151948
Atrial overdrive stimulation resulted in a regular sinus rhythm in 66 patients (69%).	2.263149118004428
Except for one patient in whom atrial flutter could not be terminated, atrial fibrillation was induced in the remaining 30 patients.	2.463235064896294
After the procedure, patients were monitored for 30 min in case of overdrive stimulation, and for approximately 3 h after electrophysiological study or 6 h if additional coronary angiography had been performed.	2.2085262557142227
Severe complications were not observed.	2.5809918718705447
In 10 cases minor hematoma occurred at the puncture site without serious sequelae.	2.0034197105433105
- Outpatients electrophysiological study as well as atrial overdrive stimulation are feasible and safe in a selected group of patients.	2.3953708626964714
Endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects.	2.45259425690244
A retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long-term results.	2.4216648787863213
The success rate for implant survival was 94.5%.	2.3294017134978744
Long-term results were promising and more than satisfactory, leading to a large indication for these endosteal implants.	2.2562930887399935
The term "Ecstasy" includes a group of different methylenedioxyamphetamines which produce hallucinogenic activity, stimulation and the so-called 'entactogenic' effects.	2.071416435087696
- "Entactogen" is usually translated as "producing a touching within" or "creating an internal contact" and refers to the special psychotropic effect of this substances.	1.8285781044617968
Entactogens have been reported to make users aware of previously unconscious feelings and experiences.	2.28863408366416
The "entactogenic" effect is the most typical of the psychedelic effects n 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA).	2.259746924988661
MDMA induces euphoria and acts stimulating, but the most common effect of MDMA is a heightened sense of "closeness" with other people.	2.2170786695632865
The negative effects, especially depression and a general sense of anxiety, may endure after the acute phase of ecstasy.	2.160712238098282
Ecstasy is not a novel substance.	3.091312456747694
However, the rapid spread connected with the arising techno-scene and the increasing prevalence of ecstasy-use world-wide is unprecedented.	1.9311628848853806
Cisatracurium - one of the ten stereoisomers of atracurium - is an intermediate long-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.	2.0925777894741504
Cardiovascular reactions have been described after administration of cisatracurium or vecuronium in surgical patients.	2.5302698225250957
After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to either receive 3xED95 or 5xED95 of cisatracurium or 3xED90 of vecuronium prior to intubation as a bolus.	1.6714309340334406
After oral premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam anaesthesia was induced with thiopental (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5%-2%).	1.9796963587263954
Six minutes after administration of thiopental, patients received the muscle relaxant.	2.4712957323719746
Six minutes later 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	1.8883524077326603
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	1.9833581138331442
Changes of heart rate or blood pressure >20% compared to baseline were defined as clinically significant.	2.1535991991262513
After application of the study drug, median values of blood pressure and heart rate were stable.	2.784067229226347
For each muscle relaxant, there were several patients who had statistically significant cardiovascular changes.	2.4142675351377285
After 3xED95 cisatracurium, 3 of 21 patients exhibited haemodynamic changes >20% (2 exhibited hypotension and 1 tachycardia), while in the high-dose cisatracurium group 2 of 21 patients demonstrated a tachycardia that was predetermined to be statistically but not clinically significant.	2.050023111909534
The frequency of all individual cardiovascular changes after the application of the muscle relaxant was not dose-dependent.	2.346635405688339
After the administration of cisatracurium in two different doses (3xED95 and 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) only minor cardiovascular changes were observed.	2.0249039413737084
Both drugs proved to be safe for use during induction of anaesthesia in patients ASA I-II.	2.3502929109479926
With regard to its cardiovascular effects, cisatracurium shares with vecuronium the requirements of an ideal muscle relaxant.	2.0482975657465077
Between June 1993 and September 1995, 18 distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail.	2.1037856611697516
There were 8 type A fractures and 10 type C fractures (AO classification).	2.0991585609456864
The operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch.	1.9395366006428856
Follow-up was available on all patients and averaged 18.3 months (range 6-32 months).	2.3855623326827002
All fractures healed with an average time to union of 12.4 weeks (range 8-16 weeks).	2.357193149813014
Bone grafting was not necessary in any case.	2.5285991256689817
Sixteen patients achieved almost the same ROM as they had had before the injury.	2.143480428449744
One patient developed a varus malignment and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy 20 months post trauma.	1.9560244626660386
There were no infections or nonunions.	2.304122265966704
The retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of dia- and supracondylar femoral fractures.	2.2554179680613244
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogenic (AAA) bone is an osteoinductive preparation of completely demineralized bone matrix.	1.8384365498012867
It has been clinically applied for years.	2.2626119604981008
In an experimental study in rabbits, we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with AAA bone.	2.327589117801444
Two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits.	2.2702731114235917
A cell-excluding PTFE membrane was wrapped circularly around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum.	2.1806516417752055
The posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane.	1.9971357869114326
Thus, two compartments were created selectively, preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants.	2.03637074183868
For each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative CT (pQCT) scans.	1.9250410479376567
Implantation of AAA bone led to new bone formation in both compartments.	2.3658341793387514
Contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost fourfold increase in bone volume.	2.257307771505377
Although bone formation showed interindividual variations, the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the Student's t-test for paired samples (P < 0.0001).	1.9737653842603637
The data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized.	1.9915833912073617
In osseous augmentations with AAA bone, the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant.	2.3348343542603014
Shielding from the periosteum, e.g., by cell-excluding membranes, leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of AAA bone and should therefore be avoided.	2.1372217496833277
Computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in Europe.	2.1567385907958707
Reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern CT scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes.	1.8646538019936403
The lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low-dose CT owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma.	2.147146811557395
Undernutrition, particularly protein undernutrition, contributes to the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture, by lowering bone mass and altering muscle strength.	2.119965231038185
Furthermore, the rate of medical complications after fracture can also be increased by nutritional deficiency.	2.5885659109747454
The IGF-I system appears to be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to osteoporotic hip fracture in elderly and to its complications.	2.3223285205353945
In the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin D supplies, protein supplements increasing the intakes from low to normal, raises IGF-I levels, improves the clinical outcome after hip fracture, and attenuates the decrease in proximal femur bone mineral density in the year following the fracture.	1.8554075601116113
This underlines the importance of nutritional supports in preventing and healing osteoporotic fractures.	2.293616607756583
The article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised.	2.545610761757071
The chances for a refinancing of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the realm of public law.	1.8400929921160052
With the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects.	2.021728252518705
Simultaneously it gains normative significance.	2.4965211368194624
This is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions, and further in the context of the discussion concerning the revitalisation of local social policy for the elderly.	2.265957863931719
Precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the municipalities may be excused from their responsibility to form, preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly.	1.9413387041049837
A comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens (p53, PCNA, Ki67), DNA flow-cytometry and ultrastructures of neoplastic cells from 120 cases of laryngeal cancers.	1.7348179223941977
Clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority (T3, 43%; T4, 18%).	2.2822025362755802
A 5-grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei.	2.402292498459667
Positive staining was obtained in 70% for p53, 57% for Ki67 and 80% for PCNA.	1.9949785308076988
Sixty-two percent of the cases were DNA-diploid and 38% DNA-aneuploid.	2.584030377764205
The DNA-diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei, preservation of wide margins of nuclear heterochromatin, enlargements of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei.	2.1350943383164225
In the aneuploid-polyploid cancers the nuclei had a substantial polymorphism, with large cleaved nuclei showing significant variations in size and having a nuclear envelope.	1.7363512473173457
A frequent finding was euchromatization of chromatin.	2.233656447096039
Dense chromatin appeared in the form of small clumps spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei.	2.1972526726654533
Enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found.	2.43126156050759
The antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds.	2.1275200252693094
Until twenty years ago, aspirin, phenazone derivatives and acetaminophen had been used as standard remedies for intercurrent harmless pain conditions in connection with infections, trauma, small surgeries, but also for tension headache and other painful conditions.	1.9942215475793663
During the last decades, this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2-arylpropionic acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation.	2.432151575015809
Some of them (e.g.	2.1725534397269715
ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) have been given over-the-counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses.	2.0757437833291985
Nevertheless, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions.	2.1170737132924495
A 38-year-old man presented with an intracranial extra-axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma.	2.3294965127131317
Meningeal melanocytoma is a rare, benign melanotic tumour of the leptomeninges occuring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults.	2.3273104625325347
It shows characteristic cytologic features with isomorphic epitheloid or spindle-shaped cells, often with prominent nucleoli and a variable content of intracytoplasmic melanin.	1.8875539078470915
It usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate, necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies.	1.7928747104813973
Its immunohistological profile with S-100 protein-, vimentin- and HMB-45-positive tumour cells is similar to that of (primary or metastatic) malignant melanoma.	2.068252697435724
This differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications.	2.5721009623507034
Therefore, everyone dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare, but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma.	2.0147885600996527
A 54-year old, obese woman suffered from massive symmetrical swelling of the face, especially of the upper and lower eyelids.	2.616907124291793
Initially the swelling occured intermittently, but after 2 years it was permanent and progressive markedly limiting her visual fields.	1.9230114951605846
Neither laboratory findings nor imaging procedures provided any firm evidence of an underlying cardiac, renal or endocrinological disease.	1.9328789326737545
There was no suggestion of a storage disease.	2.1763922319877484
Skin biopsy showed foam cells and granulomatous inflammation, so the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having a monosymptomatic Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome.	2.0227620778824518
Eyelid surgery was performed to improve her visual fields.	2.638766344010362
Treatment with clofazimine 100 mg daily was initiated.	2.251477750199763
Regular follow-up visits over 7 months revealed no evidence of recurrence.	2.7065971950369008
The patient died a sudden cardiac death a few months later.	2.459190089713233
The definite cause of her facial swelling remains unclear as we discuss the differential diagnostic possibilities.	2.172816274523163
An 81-year-old patient had prolonged competitive neuromuscular blockade with train-of-four ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively, after two successive anaesthesia procedures (enflurane-N2O/O2; vecuronium-succinylcholine-sequence) for transurethral prostate resection.	1.9053850275755948
Although antagonism with neostigmine was promptly successful after the first, 65-min period of anaesthesia (1.5 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation, 3 mg vecuronium), repetitive and chronologically staggered administration of neostigmine after the second, 30-min period of anaesthesia (1 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation) had hardly any effect, so that the patient had to be ventilated mechanically for a total of 4.5 h. Laboratory analysis revealed homozygous, atypical, plasma cholinesterase (790 U/l; dibucaine number 23; genotype E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|).	1.7240703859943773
This retrospectively confirmed a succinylcholine-induced phase II block in both instances, as had already been suspected following the second anaesthetic procedure.	1.909002065152997
The degree of block transformation, and thus the available time, are decisive in explaining the diverse effects of antagonism here.	2.0239995537405426
It must be assumed that a complete phase II block developed after the first succinylcholine exposure owing to the longer duration of anaesthesia; the purely competitive component (train-of-four ratio 0.1) was easily antagonized by neostigmine.	1.947734432509535
At the time of the attempted antagonism after the second, shorter period of anaesthesia, however, block transformation was still incomplete (train-of-four ratio 0.5).	2.1991873240760706
The administration of neostigmine therefore rather intensified the depolarization segment of the mixed block, so that repeated attempts at antagonism then inhibited any further block transformation.	1.9259702355909505
The Ph1-negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) are described, and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given.	2.013484837966614
These are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2,331 patients with CMPDs among a total of 34,160 patients referred between 1 January 1989 and 30 June 1994 to the Bone Marrow Registry.	1.942261462074739
These cases of CMPD break down into the main groups as follows: CML 23.2 %, megakaryocytic myelosis consistent with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia 22.3 %, essential thrombocythemia 22.1 %, and polycythemia vera 20.4 %; 12.0 % of cases were unclassifiable.	1.6476934228677396
Histological progress in each group is characterized by (1) increasing number and pleomorphy of megakaryocytes, (2) increasing fibrosis, and (3) excess of blasts.	2.4912606357978695
These three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy.	2.469532916622943
Therefore, it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively.	2.2567558103152465
A staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced.	2.304799887990592
Its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic biop-sies.	2.4209223749367217
Chondral and osteochondral lesions as well as bone bruises of the ankle are caused in the most cases by trauma and are localized almost exclusively at the talus.	2.396240448754496
For diagnosis, operative management and follow up, magnetic resonance imaging was useful, which can be further improved by application of intravenous or intraarticullar contrast enhancement (Gadolinium).	2.2560673265061517
In adults operative therapy is favored.	2.442633499516875
Due to new techniques, arthroscopy became an important alternative to arthrotomy.	2.1635435207719103
According to the stage of the disease, drilling or curettage, removal or fixation of the fragment, autologous bone transplantation or osteochondral graft can be performed.	2.2210851505196483
All procedures can be managed arthroscopically.	2.877923079031322
General Psychotherapy isn't a new type of therapy, but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically-oriented psychotherapists.	2.2519315718994286
The contents of this model are defined.	2.5704916400591555
Arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods.	1.819647865143195
The procedure rules should be joined together by a theoretical conception of psychological functioning, from which their relative significance and prescription conditions can be derived.	1.813036930211437
A consistency-theory based model of psychological functioning is sketched, from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other.	1.9917185708504774
The advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed.	2.554020161737049
In the Federal Republic of Germany, no data existed regarding the frequency of open heart surgery for excision of cardiac neoplasms.	2.2162622671581107
Therefore, a standard questionnaire concerning heart tumors was sent to all 77 German heart centers performing cardiac surgery.	1.95096752312757
Although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer, randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates.	2.1095318487500774
All randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage III and IV disease.	2.614985573831789
In our opinion, this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials (maximum 18%).	2.28208218852464
estimate that a 40%-50% complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen.	2.2371606201068444
To date, such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been attainable in resectable T2-T3, N0-N2 disease.	1.8470992375172492
Therefore, we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages.	2.22908429795899
Patients (pts) were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin/5-FU prior to surgery and radiotherapy (arm A, 70 pts) or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy (arm B, 74 pts).	1.9929905015658886
Patients were classified according to primary tumour site and neck disease.	2.098498953673428
The observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer (CR: 43%, PR: 37%, NR: 15%, PD: 5%).	2.020107682854141
After a follow-up of 12-96 months overall survival was 58% in arm A and 45% in arm B (n.s.).	1.9956365323965863
Therefore, we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and tonsils and stage T2-T3 and N0-N2 disease prior to surgery.	2.3775100221700445
Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery has evolved as a reliable method to perform left internal mammary artery (LIMA) bypass surgery to the LAD.	2.157001593723217
This novel technique represents a synthesis of known approaches to coronary surgery using sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation and limited access techniques in general thoracic surgery.	1.8888686981289053
Applying specially designed tools for both harvesting the internal mammary artery and mechanically stabilizing the anterior surface of the heart during anastomosis, this approach is gaining widespread acceptance.	2.1162439968581577
A steadily growing number of patients with proximal LAD lesions are submitted to cardiac surgery and the procedure is performed with increasing success rates, now approaching 98% short term patency.	2.2643524279908904
In a specific series war injuries in the trochanteric region were characterized; a limited methodological approach magnified the problem.	1.967165611344308
Our experience and the treatment results (debridement, drainage and external fixation) are presented.	2.334432887527849
The methodology, complications and final results are also given for 15 patients.	2.2321155977239444
Consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as spongioplasty or internal fixation conversion methods.	2.2025772371260754
The time to consolidation without complications was 28.6 weeks (24-36) and with complications (deep infections, chronic osteomyelitis) 40.8 weeks (28-68).	1.9526150262523987
In total, there was one poor result with angulation, shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent fistulation.	2.2383226160807426
The average follow-up was 22.7 months (1-34 months).	2.6462393952597627
Our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation.	2.576605522181313
Under war conditions, primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results.	2.063951526806902
Minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly.	2.096703862354456
Introduction of the computed tomography index CTDI and the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) has led to standardization of the dose description in CT examinations.	1.9844941266573297
Despite the use of these dose parameters, many different dosages are reported in the literature for different CT methods.	2.5942686242180493
In addition, there is still a wide range of radiation dosimetry results reported for conventional CT, helical CT, and HRCT used in chest examinations.	2.1693933311601796
In addition, CT dosimetry instrumentation and methodology make a contribution to dosages.	1.995860055361819
Recent studies calculating differences in factors affecting dosage and CT dosimetry and using similar operating parameters, show similar results in CT dosimetry for conventional and helical CT. On the other hand, dosages for HRCT were greatly reduced.	1.7821018637821293
This was mainly caused by narrow beam collimation and increasing section spacing.	2.0928396062287993
Central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients.	2.478238393855485
In most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli.	2.545890883463289
Despite the introduction of hypocoagulative drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about 10 % in trauma patients.	2.3690658167295426
Estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too.	2.4197936609761332
In haemodynamically symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated, mortality rates of up to 93 % are reported in literature.	2.494981141119593
After introduction of the heart- and lung-machine in the surgical concept of therapy, survival rates have increased significantly.	2.447750073438232
We report on three cases of successful surgical embolectomy after CPR.	2.1212231728187034
In a review of literature current concepts of treatment in central pulmonary embolism are discussed.	2.5153229264558865
Imaging of tumors of the pancreas may have a series of significant implications for surgical decision making.	2.5972508170918127
First of all verification and localization of a suspected tumor is crucial.	2.265275532666363
Later on, accurate staging of local tumor extent and of distant metastases is necessary for evaluating the indications for surgical intervention.	2.2717362502859473
If histologic proof of malignancy of a pancreatic lesion is needed, different imaging techniques can be used for percutaneous biopsy of the tumor.	2.2581363647262376
Finally imaging is required in patients with a pancreatic tumor if an obstruction of the common bile duct is treated with palliative intent by endoscopy or transhepatic intervention.	2.2985520070096634
A rational and efficient selection from all the imaging techniques currently available requires a clear-cut definition of what is needed for surgical decision making in each individual case.	1.9510401257044003
Thereby one has to take into account whether the tumor arises from the exocrine or from the endocrine tissue of the pancreas.	2.336170064654146
In spite of the importance of skin diseases in Africa south of the Sahara, dermatology is insufficiently represented within the established primary health care systems.	1.950741643744469
Aim of this study was to find out whether an integrated dermatology project could reduce the prevalence of dermatoses.	2.349972897817244
Magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be a sensitive method for diagnostics of the red bone marrow, the composition of which changes physiologically and during pathological processes.	2.246114526803698
However, the interpretation of MRI in patients with disorders of the red bone marrow is very difficult.	2.970943060605161
The aim of this study was the characterization of the proton spectrum of healthy bone marrow and its age- and sex-dependent changes to obtain a data basis for measurements in patients.	1.9384111696067918
The emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 3 points) with no recordable blood pressure.	1.8882225646191295
With a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the nearest cardiothoracic surgical unit.	2.150119207217411
During transfer, the patient had a cardiac standstill with asystole and was further reanimated and resuscitated.	2.3108525916425138
On arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro-femoral cannulation was supported by a heart-lung-machine circulation.	2.0743729721098925
Through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated.	2.3299186898762176
The heart was effectively emptied and with deep hypothermia with a reduction of oxygen consumption by all organs especially the brain was taken care of.	2.009613875550948
Since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary, there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families.	2.276490145132213
The specific features of mitochondrial genetics, however, hamper straightforward definition of recurrence risks as in Mendelian diseases.	2.197116575365812
Empirical risks were recently provided for MELAS and MERRF syndromes and for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.	1.927130971771055
In MELAS and MERFF, higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the mothers' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring.	2.1146303338986887
Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring.	1.8823924789270832
As Leigh syndrome is found with maternal, autosomal recessive or X chromosomal transmission, the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling.	2.062759847254118
Prenatal diagnosis was reported only in one case of mitochondrial disease so far, and in our opinion it remains questionable because of the uncertain correlation of the proportion of mutant DNA in chorionic villi and in  clinically relevant tissues such as brain.	2.3708446714271116
An accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by Matthias Grünewald in his painting "The Temptation of St. Anthony", which is part of the Isenheim altar piece (1512 - 1516), which is now exhibited in Colmar, Alsace.	1.9413577613984474
In contrast, Sutton in 1916 only described a "leucoderma acquisitum centrifugum", leaving the nature of the central lesion in the dark.	2.0494359373047724
The term Sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative eponymic designation "Grünewald naevus".	1.8867112002985373
In women with breast cancer, staging of the tumor plays an important role and often is considered to be the most prognostic and therapeutic factor.	2.6556099681520138
The most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic TNM classification.	2.5594086820076525
In recent years conservative therapies such as preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy are used more often with limited tissue evaluation resulting in insufficient or even inaccurate staging data.	1.7963261435295919
Tumor size as well as nodal involvement is decisive in selecting a treatment method and assessing the response.	2.398270297553775
Thus, more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary.	2.224258530020899
This article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine) used for breast cancer staging.	2.151716635351983
Furthermore, results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging.	2.420961644373306
The lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot.	2.1202148104993053
The equinus (a contracture of the triceps surae muscle), the abduction and clubfoot deformity are the most common ones.	2.337828903670307
The present paper describes the deformities and stresses the functional relevance for the patient.	2.0834716647842866
Therapeutic principles of the conservative orthopaedic means are described with special emphasis on the need of an adequate height of the aide and the foot position.	2.2443864683801715
Casting and the application of Botulinun toxine are described having a major side effect of muscle weakening.	2.3794746352106046
A combination of the different procedures, surgical interventions included, need to be selected for each patient offering the best management for each individual problem.	2.278079428475651
Still's disease was originally described as one form of rheumatoid arthritis in children beginning with fever and other systemic symptoms.	2.176902089256624
In rare cases it may also begin in the adult and is then referred to as adult-onset Still's disease.	2.0401028374910584
The diagnostic criteria include typical rash, arthralgias, bouts of fever, and leukocytosis, as well as lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, liver dysfunctions, non-infectious angina, and absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies.	2.032743588559587
We report two adult patients with longstanding disease whose exanthema guided us to the correct diagnosis.	2.0269754014219967
The rash is a finding with high sensitivity.	2.5012342815403894
It is characterized by red macules with distinct borders and is evanescent.	2.1477899629481936
During an acute flare of the rash, gentle friction induces erythematous, isomorphic (Koebner) phenomena, which, as we describe here for the first time, may persist longer than the remainder of the fleeting rash.	1.8247381257238948
Objective: Patients in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) have a high incidence of nosocomial infections which often lead to septic shock and death.	2.2297664829864883
Since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult, it was recommended to obtain routine nose/throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient.	2.3969920794816657
Methods: In 1435 patients of our cardio-surgical ICU, routine nose/throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro-organisms and resistance to antibiotics.	1.8405556335609883
Of these 86 patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation, and additional blood cultures were obtained.	2.169550498893439
Antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose/throat swabs, or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative.	1.978390074372869
Results: Of the 86 patients with systemic inflammation, 29 had blood cultures positive for microbes.	2.11381448556504
Of these 29 patients, 18 received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose/throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab.	2.1175133188608806
However, in only 11 of the 18 patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes.	2.1792991874131613
While positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response, routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity.	2.2489275758453897
Conclusions: Routine nose/throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22% of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation.	2.2156363029643744
As a result, we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier, specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients.	1.8642141941829538
The influence of defensivity, measured by validity scales of personality inventories (MMPI-K, FPI-R, GIESSEN-Test) on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in 309 patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy.	1.7626415356050562
In general, psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity.	2.1638775260971346
25% of patients, who denied psychopathology at admission, did so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up, demonstrating an "especially good outcome" (means).	2.1123025865830316
Relative improvement (effect sizes), however, was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales.	2.154167986298591
- Results are discussed with regard to prior hypotheses about the influence of defensivity.	2.9129380105118967
In our study we tested 2 different rapid assays for cardiac troponin t (TropT-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,2 ng/ml and TropTsensitive-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,1 ng/ml) in 75 chest pain patients.	1.8176142924134562
Additional to the emergency ECG (3-lead) we acquired a 12-lead ECG.	2.3557396792272183
The TropT-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 11% (specifity 94,3%).	2.0961409253072314
The TropT sensitive-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 62% (specifity 100%).	2.0274124315947137
Despite the great number of publications during the last 10 years concerning the indication, technique and results of operative treatment of acetabular fractures, conservative treatment still has an important role when considering the therapeutic possibilities.	2.4164336128033383
Because of the modern techniques of radiological imaging and improvement of diagnostic facilities, a more defined indication for treatment becomes possible.	2.121024165386027
Conventional X-rays, completed by special projections like the Ala and Obturator view, and a CT scan allow determination of the fracture type (the Letournel/Judet classification or the AO classification).	2.147310221291405
The most suitable treatment can then be adapted to the individual circumstances of the patient, i. e., age, general condition and overall severity of traumatic impairment.	2.242932906194783
Determination of the intact part of the weight-bearing dome is important in selecting the most adequate therapeutic procedure.	2.3199610095296985
The larger the intact roof arc, the better the prognosis.	2.1739538700572076
Early active motion of the injured limb, followed by walking exercises with partial weight-bearing, are important aspects of nonoperative treatment.	2.295116793287637
Conservative treatment is recommended in non-displaced fractures or in fractures with little displacement, transverse fractures of the lower region or severely comminuted acetabular fractures with no possibility of reconstruction.	2.247213346983961
Our clinical and radiological follow-up of 97 patients with acetabular fractures from the years 1981-1990 showed that the majority were treated conservatively (approx.	2.4052164140921692
The functional result after an average observation period of more than 70 months was good or excellent (based on the Merle d'Aubigné score).	2.3370410103903616
We feel it is important to look at operative and conservative treatment of acetabular fractures as two complementary non-competitive therapeutic methods.	2.1264952202842964
The choice of treatment should be based on an exact diagnosis considering fracture type, the individual circumstances of the patient, and application of the necessary diagnostic facilities.	2.615479148745205
Conservative treatment can lead to excellent long-term results.	2.790590790976842
Problem There is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients.	2.5357510581095752
The literature on these patients reports that mobility, endurance, trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity.	1.9777600922570595
Chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons.	2.156702616704274
Methods Our study group consisted of 90 disabled CLBP patients (44 female, 46 male; average age 42 years) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8-week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support (instruction, endurance training, strength exercises, behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy).	1.793968661199145
Initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons (44 female, 63 male, average age 41 years).	1.9761044579869436
The patients were investigated before and after treatment, and at intervals of 6 and 12 months.	2.8227918236283744
The reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison.	2.4514264527721625
Physical assessment included a medical examination (mainly diagnosis of radicular or nonradicular pain), changes in the lumbar spine revealed by X-ray studies according to Herron and Turner [50], rating of physical impairment according to Waddell [117], flexibility, length of hamstrings muscles (SLR), test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the Swiss group of Spring [102] and isokinetic measurements (LIDO Back), tests of lifting capacity (LIDO Lift), and (in part) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer (CASE 15 Marquette).	1.8173351310304247
Results Physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced SLR (shortened hamstrings) and decreased spinal mobility.	2.0310233798265998
Patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals.	2.3030462823882982
The results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group, whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group.	2.5147906657342824
In principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines.	2.3165370232073395
Cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients.	2.3133366727367926
At the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly.	2.3658482906851948
In many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group.	2.4588306470478267
With time, however, training effects gradually decreased.	2.811451465251151
The success of treatment (return to work, absence from work, pain reduction, use of medical care) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment.	2.673982441851594
Conclusion Study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain.	2.4848249798891113
The only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance, in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group.	2.3744992220292818
However, even CLBP- patients with long-term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program.	2.049687281824821
Back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy.	2.711474357240178
Because of loss of condition during the time after treatment, regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary.	2.2480022616372404
Overall, treatment of CLBP has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results.	2.071231148380729
The dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency-dependent.	2.3245989659811417
To date, this has still not been fully investigated or understood.	2.168145374432082
There remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution.	2.1740018336906535
The presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser-Doppler vibrometry at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens.	1.9634483208271987
Motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical equations.	1.909705153435133
Using a sound stimulus, the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured, and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by Fourier transform.	1.983374026690738
Results were used for verification of the computer models.	2.5680600002825886
In the current investigations these models were refined and allow for the detailed investigation of the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain, facilitating the optimal design of passive and active middle-ear implants.	2.0087482680513578
Problem: Postoperative nausea and vomiting remains an important problem.	2.4932363749450186
Many risk factors have been identified; however, the importance of postoperative analgesic technique and patient expectation remain poorly defined.	2.4594382839813904
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are probably not only unintended, toxic side-products of oxygen metabolism in mammalian cells, they also have several important physiologic functions including antimicrobial killing, regulation of cellular proliferation and growth, and regulation of vascular tone.	1.7795542877113695
ROS are generated within the vessel wall by several mechanisms, including a vascular type of a NAD(P)H oxidase.	2.1040597122252707
ROS formation can be stimulated by mechanical stress, environmental factors, the peptide angiotensin II, cytokines, native low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and in the presence of catalytic metal ions.	2.367311224809766
Their ability to modify LDL, react with endothelial-derived nitric oxide subsequently forming peroxynitrite, and amplify the expression of various genes important for leukocyte recruitment within the arterial wall are the basis of the oxidant injury theory of atherosclerosis.	1.8361965141151908
In animal studies, antioxidant therapy (probucol, butylated hydroxytoluene, N',N'-diphenylendiamide, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase) have been successfully used to prevent fatty streak formation, and to restore impaired nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation.	1.8199077169629578
Case-controlled and prospective clinical studies suggest a relation between baseline antioxidant plasma levels and/or antioxidant supplementation and risk of cardiovascular events.	2.1541319169761075
In one secondary prevention trial (randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled), vitamin E supplementation reduced significantly the risk for non-fatal myocardial infarctions.	2.0702358121198947
Before general recommendations can be made, results of further large-scale trials should be awaited.	2.2686307221168636
A 36-year old man suffered an isolated head injury with a fracture of the skull, epidural and subdural hematomas as well as brain contusion (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS): 5 points).	2.305397492652155
The hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.	2.33809335758796
Because of high intracranial pressure (ICP) a barbiturate coma was necessary.	2.091452520761388
Additionally, the patient demonstrated acute lung injury (ARDS) due to pneumonia 8 days after trauma.	2.3749657673108655
The patient recovered slowly and was transferred to neurorehabilitation on day 57 after injury.	2.0706283930326204
During the following 12 months the patient developed a significant deficit of hip motion (extension/flexion: right: 0 °/10 °/20 °, left: 0 °/10 °/30 °; external/internal rotation: right and left: <5 °/0 °/<5 °; abduction/adduction: right: 10 °/0 °/25 °, left: 10 °/0 °/10 °).	1.9414384320750817
X-rays and CT-scanning revealed severe heterotopic ossification (HO) of both hips with ancylosis (Brooker type IV).	1.9048918383910123
Resection of HO was carried out in a two stage procedure using Smith-Petersen approach.	2.2128873588832443
The prophylaxis for recurrence of HO included preoperative single-dose radiation (8 Gy) and postoperative treatment with indomethacin (150 mg per day).	2.0575369110116926
The patient revealed 15 (left hip) and 12 (right hip) months after surgery the following range of hip movement: extension/flexion: right: 5 °/0 °/90 °, left: 5 °/0 °/100 °; external/internal rotation: right: 20 °/0 °/30 °, left: 20 °/0 °/20 °; abduction/adduction: right: 30 °/0 °/40 °, left: 30 °/0 °/40 °.	1.8773089182263816
No recurrence of HO was observed in x-ray.	2.8009470069465405
The patient is able to work in his profession as farmer.	2.464581186924421
Gastric teratomas are rare and mostly benign.	2.5390483034848015
They frequently become evident as a palpable abdominal mass.	2.185275369541334
A malignant, aggressive solid tumor must be excluded.	2.3851298701620482
We present a 6-month-old male infant with a history of bleeding of the upper gastrointestinal tract.	2.68480680248064
After in toto excision the histopathology was that of a benign gastric teratoma.	2.108222268343547
Our method of reading the diagnosis and the subsequent therapy are described.	2.5605042676615795
The aim of this prospective study was to assess the clinical and prognostic relevance of patent foramen ovale - in contrast to risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources - in 208 patients with cerebral ischemic events.	2.3901421757807877
All patients underwent neurological examination (Doppler, CT, NMR) as well as transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography.	2.311845732788245
A patent foramen ovale was found in 75 patients (36%).	2.7219241496756377
With regard to risk factors for atherosclerosis patients with closed resp.	2.4329399163588548
patent foramen ovale revealed significant differencies for age, hypertension, diabetes and use of oral contraceptives.	2.438994021436259
Cardioembolic sources showed significant differencies for atrial fibrillation and atrial septal aneurysm.	2.327129600701051
Multivariate analysis of risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources revealed hypertension and diabetes as age dependant risk factors in patients with closed foramen ovale.	2.28153346019752
In patients with patent foramen ovale the use of oral contraceptives was found as an independant risk factor for cerebral ischemic event.	2.30844280825651
Patients >60 years with cerebral ischemic events had more often a closed foramen ovale.	2.123855247619064
Dependant on age patients with closed foramen ovale showed a higher frequency of hypertension and diabetes.	2.2978378510703616
In addition these patients revealed more often atrial fibrillation.	2.2430425049676668
Patients with patent foramen ovale had fewer risk factors for atherosclerosis or cardioembolic sources but presented more frequent the use of oral contraceptives or atrial septal aneurysm.	2.0947375613918977
A retrospective study of 86 motorcycle accidents that occurred in the year 1992 is reported.	2.1254908930691094
Examination of the case histories supplemented by telephone conversations yielded the following results: 90.7% of our patients were male and their average age was 28.8 years; the age group between 25 and 30 years was the most frequently involved (27.9%).	1.9793611240156137
Special injury patterns were found for injuries of the upper and the lower extremity.	2.8534086153830622
Lower extremity injuries (46%), and especially open tibia fractures (19.7%), were among the most common injuries sustained by motorcyclists in crashes.	2.368897085234535
Injuries of the upper extremity most frequently took the form of fracture of the distal radius (18.8%).	2.5808777763351607
The average stay in our hospital was 35.4 days.	2.357528905983802
More than half the crashes happened with motorcycles with between 500 and 750 cc stroke volume.	1.799704804905256
Over a third (34.5%) of the patients had held their driving licences for more than 8 years.	2.4212900282737126
A plea is made for more preventive measures, such as better driving instruction, better road conditions and legislative changes, against motorcycle crashes.	1.9897930655632554
From the aspects of cost and the rate of complications it is reasonable to strive for a surgical treatment as soon as possible after the crash.	2.1701563710289715
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a syndrome affecting an extremity after a minor trauma or operation.	2.2705551282263823
At the moment there is no consensus about the pathogenesis of RSD.	2.928510883718502
In 1942 Paul Sudeck suggested that the signs and symptoms of RSD may be provoked by an exaggerated inflammatory response to injury or operation of an extremity.	2.014176733025722
His theory found no disciples, as most physicians believe that RSD is initiated by an hyperactive sympathetic system.	1.924879981144106
We performed various clinical and experimental investigations, including the effects of antiinflammatory treatment.	2.5953778305434785
The results of these studies support the theory of Paul Sudeck.	2.214129988226973
Erectile failure after radical prostatectomy is a common postoperative disorder.	2.6846941242700213
However, nerve-sparing technique provides in about 50-60 % erections sufficient for sexual intercourse.	2.123999297301312
Damage to the cavernous nerves or vascular injuries are responsible for erectile dysfunction.	2.203693894961002
Alprostadil is most commonly used for self-injection monotherapy or in combination with other vasoactive drugs.	2.5792372752871784
The oral drug Sildenafil showed to be effective in patients with partial erections, however, it failed to work after non nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.	2.5382313531519003
Negative pressure devices and penile prosthesis can be considered as alternative therpeutic options.	2.40249011450628
Autologous N. suralis transplantation during radical prostatectomy might further improve erection rates in the near future.	1.92768729034809
Pregnancy causes substantial changes in the cardiovascular system: cardiac output (40%-50%) and blood volume (40%) increase whereas systemic peripheral resistance and arterial pressure decrease.	2.303495211070486
The rise in progesterone and estrogen levels accompanying pregnancy stimulates the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system.	1.9122771337027273
Increased prostaglandin production follows renin activation; simultaneously, the arterial vessels show diminished angiotension sensitivity.	1.9256261786036228
Heart disease remains the most important nonobstetric cause of maternal death.	2.67750646803846
The physiological changes in the cardiovascular system during pregnancy influence cardiac diseases in different ways.	2.2244737780217525
Pregnancy, labor, and delivery appear to be well tolerated in gravidae with an atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patents ductus arteriosus.	2.0569418006988927
Sometimes congestive heart failure occurs and appropriate medical therapy is necessary.	2.41547321222748
Pregnant women with uncorrected cyanotic congenital heart disease (Eisenmenger's syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot) constitute a high-risk group because of right ventricular insufficiency and hypoxic attacks.	2.0161578400574323
The consequences for anaesthesia in parturients with congenital heart disease are discussed.	2.3354733336324163
The symptoms of acquired mitral or aortic stenosis are aggravated by the physiological changes in the cardiovascular system during pregnancy; the clinical symptoms of valve insufficiency are ameliorated by vasodilatation.	1.9884459561143653
Peripartum cardiomyopathy clinically shows similar features to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	2.140791854339645
The basis of treatment is the same as that of congestive heart failure, with the therapeutic spectrum ranging from diet to heart transplantation.	2.402076152883409
Women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tolerate pregnancy, labor, and delivery surprisingly well.	2.1031692119180723
Vaginal delivery is possible, but epidural anaesthesia is contraindicated.	2.488393705492486
Hypertensive disorders associated with pregnancy are classified into three groups: chronic, treatment, and preeclamptic hypertension.	2.1866308195894764
Pre-eclamptic hypertension is accompanied by low cardiac output and plasma volume.	2.343565330873378
An upregulation of angiotension receptors enhances vascular reactivity, with the consequence of high peripheral resistance.	2.176324335710865
For antihypertensive therapy hydralazine, -methyldopa, and magnesium sulfate are the drugs of choice.	1.9846101859123446
A generalised recommendation of anaesthesia for the pre-eclamptic gravida cannot be made because both general and epidural anaesthesia have risks of severe side effects.	2.0196636766124176
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaws (DentaScan) is the method of choice for the radiographic assessment of the mandible and maxilla.	2.7198385824393108
It is instrumental in delineating the relationship between bony lesions and the adjacent anatomy.	2.2591773998289013
Therefore, this technique allows precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.	2.51725668058367
Using it, distinct characterization of pathology including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions can be obtained.	2.0556184126249843
The histopathology of bone marrow in primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is described, with reference to the FAB classification.	2.2495515962010866
Variants such as hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic MDS are recognized from their histopathology and must be incorporated in the FAB classification.	1.8701043912015893
The clinical significance of hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic variants is illustrated by the survival rates and leukemic transformation in these patients.	1.9238714247040558
Histopathological classification according to the FAB system corresponds with cytological classification, as proven by the distribution of the subtypes, blood values, leukemic transformation rates and survival times.	2.126846874253507
Finally it is even possible to elaborate a prognostic score for survival based on histological features of diagnostic biopsies, which emphasizes the importance of histopathological examination of bone marrow in MDS patients.	2.0432989097964147
A 58-year-old man developed an extensive pilomatrical carcinoma in the left axilla.	2.472242744927783
Clinically, a squamous cell carcinoma was suspected.	2.687856381726524
Histological examination revealed the presence of proliferating basaloid cells with many atypical mitoses and mass necrosis infiltrating into the subcutaneous tissue.	2.034966004996633
The tumor was removed by micrographic surgery with a 2 cm safety margin.	2.335182046671998
Histological examination of 2 regional lymph nodes as well as further diagnostic procedures ruled out metastases.	2.570284652957279
We review the clinical and histopathological differences between pilomatricoma and pilomatrical carcinoma, as well as the published cases of the malignant variant.	2.6195581803104333
Introduction: Recent studies evaluating lay people and health care professionals about their process-quality checking the carotid pulse demonstrated poor diagnostic accuracy and more time needed than suggested in international guidelines for CPR.	1.7348438464217075
So far there was no scientifically prooved data about the quality of checking the breathing.	2.602595264940766
Study objective was the evaluation of the  effectiveness of checking the breathing in  an emergency situation with four different groups: lay people (L), EMT /Paramedics (E), medical students (M), physicians (P).	2.091508854012417
Taking into account the increase in worldwide human migration, leprosy is of growing importance in the differential diagnosis of dermatological diseases encountered in Central Europe.	2.0878110824527885
We report on the case of a young man from Ghana who developed hypopigmented maculae and plaques on his trunk and proximal limbs.	1.867877807892813
The diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy could be made in consideration of the histological pattern of infiltrating leucocytes and detection of numerous acid-fast mycobacteria on skin biopsy.	1.9008912088508918
The results of the physical examination as well as routine laboratory and immunological parameters were consistent with this form of leprosy.	2.501592395869181
Due to glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency, treatment with dapsone was contraindicated.	2.1073749521296925
With high-dose rifampicin and clofazimine therapy, the skin changes cleared over the course of 11 months following a leprosy reaction type II (erythema nodosum leprosum) that developed during a phase of discontinued therapy due to low patient compliance.	2.0819485787881726
In the last few years two placebo controlled studies (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Study) analyzed the effect of systemic thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute hemispheric stroke.	1.8445961183967237
Both studies showed a positive longtime effect for the rt-PA treated patients.	2.3805866264232285
The number of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was higher in the rt-PA treated groups.	2.304081305720522
The results determine possible clinical or neuroradiological predictors of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with rt-PA therapy.	2.0405856210724806
The role of enteroviral myocardial infection in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy could only be substantiated after the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in-situ hybridization) in virological diagnostics of dilated cardiomyopathy.	2.3211581243172037
By using histological and especially immunohistological techniques for the detection of myocardial inflammation in patients with the tentative clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, a differentiation between inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of the WHO classification 1995 (31) was made.	2.3537164862339366
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis in association with cardiac dysfunction and is diagnosed by established histological and especially immunohistological techniques.	2.1102836553073034
The combination of histological, immunohistological, and molecularbiological techniques enabled a subgroup analysis of the incidence of enteroviral myocardial RNA in patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy in comparison to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	2.4201438757870277
The Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy, until the unity almost unknown in West-Germany, represented the most important form of therapy in the former GDR.	2.227979192153082
Its development, its conception of the relevant relationship between group-dynamic and psychoanalytic concepts and in particular its reception of psychoanalytic concepts are discussed.	1.9390057666508194
This raises the question of defining the position of this therapy form with the focus on the controverse about its proximity to psychoanalytic therapeutical concepts.	2.190505706042883
Even if we take into account that in the GDR there were very reduced possibilities to articulate psychoanalytic and particularly drive concepts, in our view the Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy cannot be considered as a psychoanalytical form of therapy.	1.9771850008829701
It represents a specific therapeutical development of the former GDR which is strongly oriented at social norms.	2.3058575702655837
It is first of all oriented at the attitude change reached by the group, that means, at the manifest, conscious behaviour of the patient and therefore focusses at the normative level of behaviour regulation in groups in the sense of interactional group therapy.	1.9872135601579206
The authors view this form of therapy as a "historical compromise" in the field of psychotherapy under the circumstances of the former GDR and in this way they take into account both its advantages and its weaknesses.	2.158359256201681
In a prospective study of central fractures of the talus, radiological data (plain radiography, CT, MRI) were scrutinized in terms of correlation with histological findings (biopsy taken at time of screw removal).	2.1730744984421704
The study looked at nine fractures in eight patients aged 14 - 48 years.	2.0708007435489066
There was one fracture of Hawkins type I, one fracture of type II, four fractures of type III, and three corpus fractures.	2.196568722098566
All were operated on within 24 h after injury; seven had screw fixation, two had adaptation with K wires.	2.1116461560268363
The patients were kept non-weight-bearing for 14 - 53 weeks.	2.1621433700347867
In the final radiograph the talus was intact in four patients, while four showed a partial avascular collapse; in one patient, a partial collapse was doubtful.	2.14559783981423
Histology taken 16 - 52 weeks after injury showed osteocyte-free original bone in all cases, with deposition of new bone varying in extent.	2.046788785572026
Hawkins sign was partially positive in six patients, positive in one, and negative in one.	2.3345514225053625
Decalcification as well as fracture healing can be better followed by CT than by plain radiography.	2.6793804981483014
MRI appeared normal in five patients, partially pathological in two, and abnormal in one.	2.1926745988441794
A positive Hawkins sign and normal signal behavior can be seen as prognostically favorable signs.	2.1778283191489787
However, in the case of a central talus fracture, even with a favorable course osteonecrosis of at least a part of the talus with gradual replacement by new bone occurred.	2.472175424736116
Vascularization of the central talus seems to be disturbed more frequently than is reflected radiologically.	2.70267599411795
Purpose: To assess the value of functional magnetic resonance urography for the noninvasive postoperative evaluation of renal transplants.	2.184428969323005
Methods: A saturation inversion projection sequence allows the selective imaging of strongly T 1 weighted signal from the MR contrast agent.	1.8311461608757866
A coronal slab leads to images comparable to conventional urography which can be acquired as a sequence with four images per minute.	2.026450133069123
Results: 15 patients with urologic questionable findings after renal transplantation were studied.	2.203230371305227
FMRU revealed in 6 patients normal findings, in 6 moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis without any urodynamic relevant obstruction.	2.2869701550148034
3 pathologic findings, ureteral leak, ureteropelvic-junction obstruction and ureteral stenosis were diagnosed and consequently surgically treated.	1.8824497325905944
The imaging quality in all studies was diagnostic and urologically relevant.	2.203712764262347
Conclusion: FMRU can be used as a noninvasive technique for the assessment of renal transplant in cases with suspicion of complication in the excretory system.	2.4765095765441085
The infection after intramedullary nailing is a severe complication, which is hard to eradicate.	2.5186985130951536
The results of reaming the intramedullary canal after removal of the infected nail were evaluated in our investigation.	2.24520282570661
From 1984 to 1991 fifty-five patients with infected intramedullary nails of the lower extremity were included in this trial.	2.4304184409422054
Twenty-one patients had an infection of the femur.	2.8086145127070297
Thirty-four patients had a primary infection of the nail, twenty-one patients had multiple operations with periods of infection prior to nailing.	2.2802962766306356
All patients had signs of a chronic osteitis and sinus formation.	2.3186537957372177
At the time of the follow-up the success of the procedure was evaluated regarding recurrence of infection, range of motion of the extremity and patient comfort.	2.699497738785997
The mean time of observation was 10,1  +/-  4,9 years.	2.470442955061415
All patients with initially infected intramedullary nails had no recurrence of the infection, compared to 62 % of those with multiple operations prior to nailing.	2.1541182999491877
At the time of the follow up all fractures had healed.	2.4634991553018493
85 % of the patients performed full weight bearing.	3.214366994446135
32 patients (91 %) had good or excellent ROM of the adjacent joints.	2.4514785106048054
The discussion about the therapy of the posterior cruciate ligament persists.	3.1956103539496485
Conservative treatment, augmented repair, and reconstruction with autografts are discussed.	2.081558365837228
From 1993 to 1997, 49 patients with posterior cruciate ligament rupture had repair Trevira ligament augmentation of 3 mm.	2.20393934697528
There were 21 isolated and 28 combined ruptures.	2.160387928454183
In 5 cases bony avulsions were refixed by screw or additional hook plate.	1.8861784607713201
Investigation of 36 patients, in 15 cases with isolated ligamentous ruptures was made.	2.307259606885229
Osseous avulsion had good results in all cases.	2.7076500207137033
Isolated posterior cruciate ligament rupture showed good stability in 7 of 15 cases and instability of 2 + in 8 cases.	2.301624095552651
The medial range Lysholm score was 76.8 (+/- 21.6), the OAK score showed 2 very good and 5 good results, 3 fair and 5 bad results.	2.171719528294296
Using the IKDC score led to 3 very good and 4 good results, 2 fair and 6 bad results.	2.1429019597812995
Using subjective criteria, 10 patients described results as very good or good, 2 fair and 3 bad.	2.117628793243537
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture with additional knee injury or fracture of the leg showed bad results in 60 % of cases, and good or fair results in only 40 %.	2.229005247598584
We think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft.	2.7152177919320537
Through cooperation between the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK), results of standardized patch tests performed by the participating centres are centrally recorded in Germany.	1.9010518548359252
For this study, data from 24 departments of dermatology (19678 patients) were evaluated retrospectively and separately for 1995 and 1996.	2.288344460737112
With decreasing frequency, nickel, fragrance mix, balsam of peru, and thimerosal yielded positive reactions most often; suprisingly high numbers of positive reactions were also seen with amerchol L-101 and palladium.	1.7178323061511769
Differentiated lists of allergens were compiled for 1995, referring to subgroups of patients (defined by gender, age, localization of eczema, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and particular problems.	1.8644043912565675
In men, percentages of positive reactions were markedly lower for nickel, fragrance mix and balsam of peru than in women.	1.8831305416272417
Younger patients reacted more often to thimerosal and older ones to topical medical preparations.	1.9499402708820492
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in patients with hand eczema.	2.65420175679921
A comparison of positive reactions obtained in distinct geographical regions was problematic because of differences between test populations.	1.9810787002339454
The spectrum of allergens found in officeworkers was similar to that of the whole test population.	2.3552161718399898
Patients with positive reactions to nickel and fragrance mix had more positive reactions to unrelated allergens than the total test population.	1.9553167568687013
Sex- and age-adjusted frequencies of sensitization revealed a decrease in reactions to nickel and an increase in reactions to mercury allergens from 1995 to 1996.	2.2289583121869394
The clinical relevance of mercury reactions was often not apparent.	2.321970019043778
Differentiated lists of allergens can be used to improve the quality of diagnostic and prophylactic procedures in allergic contact dermatitis.	2.4727216282081175
Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (BT) induce a localized, long-lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the BT dose administered and that is free of major side effects.	2.0514906127492383
With this profile, BT can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle hyperactivities.	2.304699474246835
They are difficult to treat with conventional methods, can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system.	2.0965338479623776
In the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of BT in rehabilitative neurology.	2.2181871248488387
Regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome, five main indication groups are identified: (1) improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles; (2) relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles; (3) improvement of patient care; (4) avoidance of sequelae in joints, tendons, ligaments, and teeth; (5) various special indications.	2.287275340681146
In patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), it is assumed that apnea-associated changes of hemodynamics, blood gases, and rheology lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep.	2.219251732788738
This investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without SRBD.	2.98552206464442
Currently no serological marker for the monitoring of uveal melanoma and its metastases is available.	2.224302458254728
The novel tumorassociated antigen Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is expressed in the uveal melanoma and it's metastatic lesions.	1.8769338647138147
Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with shortened action potential duration (APD) and reduced atrial refractoriness.	2.124171154146318
Remodeling of ion currents responsible for AP morphology has been proposed as a major mechanism in persistent AF.	2.0242912926852568
In the present study we investigated the activity of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel and the mRNA transcription of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel subunits in patients with persistent AF compared to patients in sinus rhythm (SR).	2.143193182278442
Right atrial appendages of 10 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF were used for myocyte isolations to record L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa,L) by the patch-clamp technique.	1.8731445648102236
Right atrial appendages of 16 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF served as sources for determining the mRNA expression of the L-type Ca2+ channel 1c-, 2/-, a-, and b/c-subunits by semiquantitative RT-PCR.	1.8244534151019107
Cell sizes, expressed as cell capacitance, were identical in both groups.	2.070056015207373
mRNA expressions of the 1c-subunit and the b/c-subunits were reduced in AF patients by 18.9% (p < 0.05) and 77.7% (p < 0.005), respectively, while mRNA transcriptions of the 2/- and the a-subunits were not significantly different between SR and AF patients.	1.9717420016156575
A decrease in the availability of functional L-type Ca2+ channels in AF patients, due to reduced 1c-subunit and substantial lack of b/c-subunit transcription seems to contribute to the shortening pf APD and refractory periods in AF, thereby favoring increased atrial excitation rate and perpetuation of AF.	1.8697621119247552
34 patients aged 3 months to 20years underwent transcatheter-occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils (Cook).	1.9159632085202516
Eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a Rashkind-occluder; 7 patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition.	2.1186937719116226
Only 6 patients had a large ductus with a diameter between 3 and 4 mm; all had systolic-diastolic murmurs.	2.2216910509298553
All other patients had ductus-diameters below 3 mm; three of them had systolic-diastolic murmurs, 17 had systolic murmurs, and 8 patients had no murmur at all.	1.8503487327635824
The ductus was closed in 24 patients using artrial access only, in 6 patients via a venous, and in 4 patients both via venous and arterial catheterization.	2.2336285089915777
One coil was used in 23 patients, 2 coils in 9, and 3 coils in 2 patients.	2.438650169604521
There were no complications of the intervention.	2.4745003462618227
Within 24 hours 31 patients (93%) had complete closure of the ductus and 32 patients (94%) after 6 months.	2.106901188000259
Coil-embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick, safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation.	2.0087128759291106
It seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs.	2.2059295798371457
The purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient.	2.979896301800948
As shown by a number of studies, preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance.	2.310641898917631
Abnormal laboratory results in otherwise healthy patients rarely alter the anaesthetic management of the patient and are not related to perioperative complications.	2.4630636776509083
Extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care budgets.	2.108491840026688
A more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable savings.	2.0585399513709484
To achieve costeffective evalulation an efficient organisation of properative assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on-day-of-surgery-cancellations.	1.9668858920803411
There is no medicolegal obligation to perform routine diagnostic testing.	2.0670987805474126
The anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary.	2.6244918824050636
According to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease.	2.3410344186186567
Careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated.	1.9810065987701893
The botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst.	2.231898340522112
The origin of the BOC can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue.	2.4792951109288652
The BOC is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible, as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between 60 and 70 years.	2.7866104588961225
Histopathologically the BOC is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin, nonkeratinized epithelium.	1.9601138525839026
Clusters of glycogen-rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular thickenings of the cyst lining.	2.0658541460440216
For the clinician, the differentiation of the BOC from the keratocyst and ameloblastoma is relevant.	2.1465723822418936
One case of a large BOC (65-year-old male, BOC regio 33-45, diameter 5 cm, radiographically and histologically multilocular) is presented with a review of the literature, including the therapeutic management, and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed.	2.497308669489442
The immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin (CK) 13 implicates the histogenetic origin of the BOC from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands.	1.9222833110771125
The expression of CK 19 and the lack of expression of p53, as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the BOC, may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst.	2.3745786407119778
Within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill, we examined 83 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program.	2.1349958877958386
The course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3-year period by means of annual follow-up examinations.	2.8064849814227255
The sample comprised 44 men and 39 women with an average age of 35 years (SD +/- 8,5).	2.346163127181068
The majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization.	2.481191215181462
After 3 years, 22% of the patients were integrated into the general labor market, 26% had sheltered employment, 23% were still in work therapy, and 29% were unemployed.	2.230163592511921
Besides the patients' subjective expectations, early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration.	2.0895019696997874
Outpatient work therapy is a contemporary, effective organizational form of sociotherapy.	2.2900387699346934
It may contribute to improved vocational competence and integration, reduced psychiatric hospitalization and stabilized psychopathology.	2.0857393083013496
Objective: Based on personal observations the neuromuscular blocking potency of atracurium was supposed to be diminished in purulent intrathoracic diseases.	1.923731460805205
This hypothesis was tested in a prospective clinical trial.	2.8855391302902507
Aim of study: Goal of this survey is to give an overview of anaesthesia for caesarean section in Germany.	2.2380415956258655
Ultrasound contrast agent is used in color Doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels.	2.1013010162713903
We present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained.	2.8823317175823404
Up until now, 30 patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus, tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined.	2.399185417816337
Conventional B-scan sonography was supplemented by non-contrast color Doppler flow imaging.	2.1943439056140317
Depending on the indication, 2.5 g Levovist in bolus or 4 g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of 300 or 400 mg/ml.	1.909953203755476
The fractioned injection of 4 g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than 10 min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent.	2.2859967406937214
In 64% of the lymph nodes, vessels could only be identified with the administration of Levovist.	2.644015003919567
The general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83% of the cases.	2.201266868877079
The lymph-node-supplying vessels were identified in 8 of 11 patients after the injection of contrast media.	2.4433569573173224
Additional information, which was gained in 17 patients, increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept.	2.60662073297142
In three cases, the examinations with the signal enhancer resulted in a change in therapy.	2.549249236322814
By applying signal enhancer in color Doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded.	2.2037943514305054
Non-syndromic neurosensory recessive deafness (NSRD) is one of the most common human sensory disorders.	2.151294940829272
Mutations in the connexin 26 gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic non-syndromic deafness in different populations.	2.0612020925847916
Laser-induced thermotherapy is an in situ ablation method for the local treatment of liver tumors.	2.2579975470428453
The basic prerequisite for induction of adequate treatment volumes for clinical use was the development of a thermostable application system.	2.380886227660685
In an ex vivo test series, the specially developed application system (diffuser tip) with 5760 J had a higher thermic loading capacity than the Ringmode applicator with 4200 J, thus enabling the induction of significantly larger lesions with a volume of 7.6 cm3.	1.722710175097718
The results of a further in vivo test series demonstrated that the lesions were subject to a four-phase connective-tissue organization within a 6-month period.	2.116535458665621
Furthermore, the same laser energy (4200 J) was associated with a significantly lower lesion volume of 2.5 cm3 in the in vivo than in the ex vivo test series.	2.172956151355305
The influence of liver perfusion on the inducible lesion volume was examined in a further animal experimental study.	2.1145461566547383
By temporarily interrupting hepatic blood perfusion (Pringle's maneuver) during laser application, the effective volume could be increased to 50.3 cm3 (P < 0.01) using an optical beam splitter.	1.8891799201568353
The results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique.	2.212330560767303
Using cell culture a urogenital C. trachomatis infection could be detected in 72 of 222 patients.	2.225828268974126
Referred to the detection rate of the Amplicor test and that of the cell culture, sensitivity was 91.2% for the test sensitivity and 79.1% for the cell culture.	2.2681663228515205
The specificity of both techniques was 100% when the specimens for which neither both nor either one of the tests gave positive results were considered.	2.096661800358474
In accordance with other studies, this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will supersede cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of C. trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital chamydial infections.	2.100081716376754
Incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear.	2.34702182617099
Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is characterized as an acute, protein-rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure.	2.256734367195542
NPE is infrequently diagnosed, usually in association with head trauma.	2.450312110772664
Pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left-atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability.	1.991764198785359
In contrast to NPE, cardiac complications are frequently observed, most consistently in patients with subarachoid hemorrhage.	2.3007826807755283
Typical ECG changes are repolarization abnormalities, similar to those observed in coronary heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias.	2.5193435530232415
The CK-MB may be slightly elevated; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left-ventricular function.	1.9846449536353779
Pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis.	2.4056475322083775
Cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines.	2.1541322510011245
For adequate treatment, close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions.	2.854205809503418
Benign, non-parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or CT scan.	2.051362657369583
We present the case of a 68-year-old patient who showed obstructive jaundice due to a hemorrhagic liver cyst compressing the choledochal duct.	2.150617440645659
Due to the location of the cyst in the porta hepatis with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma, operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm.	2.0482338317975373
This review summarizes briefly pathophysiology, clinical definitions, pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic procedures and principles of therapy and prophylaxis of ischemic stroke.	2.2848306284031636
Ischemic stroke is defined as a localized lack of cerebral perfusion mainly due to cardioembolic or arterial-embolic occlusion of cerebral arteries or hemodynamic or microangiographic reduction of cerebral blood flow.	2.0008895347930906
We focused on pathophysiological mechanisms with potential clinical relevance as the role of oxygen and glucose concentration, the therapeutic time window, the role of excitatory neurotransmitters, Ca2+-influx, free radicals, and the development of ischemic brain edema.	2.415348369585347
Based on this data the need of an urgent initiation of diagnostic workup and therapy is emphasized.	2.1437765279083982
This includes the early basic management with monitoring of blood pressure, ECG, oxygen and blood glucose concentration, and the balance of the water and electrolyte supply.	2.4543767954354974
Since specific therapeutic and prophylactic interventions are based on an exact diagnosis with respect to the pathogenesis, the need of an urgent diagnostic workup including clinical examination, laboratory baseline, vascular ultrasound, cranial CT-scan, ECG, and echocardiography is emphazised.	2.2963366357794284
Based on these results appropriate management of certain pathogenetic stroke subgroups is discussed.	1.9501220878481518
New data about the effectiveness of basic care, treatment of edema, neuroprotective agents, and thrombolysis is presented.	2.2842214410766877
Longitudinal osteocutaneous defects of the sternal region including the caudal third were reconstructed in 15 patients during a 3-year period by using the "vertical (VRAM)- and transverse rectus abdominis muscle" (TRAM) flap.	2.0423655436851695
The majority of the defects resulted from chronic osteomyelitis after previous cardiothoracic surgery or were due to former therapy of breast cancer.	1.9996782307675616
Three VRAM/TRAM flaps were primarily transferred as free flaps with microvascular anastomosis in the axilla region.	1.8723051751821298
Nine out of 12 pedicled VRAM or TRAM flaps required an additional microvascular anastomosis because of imminent venous or arterial insufficency ("supercharging").	1.7910746066672827
Therefore, operative technique and operating time of the pedicled and free flap for reconstruction of longitudinal sternal defects are comparable.	2.0947448164649063
Adequate reconstruction and rehabilitation was achieved in 11 cases.	2.8473618825179434
In 2 patients revision and partial secondary defect coverage was required.	2.041039769711118
Two male patients died postoperatively due to their preexisting condition.	2.4544114131131316
The introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections.	1.8998144156700212
Lengthening and shortening is achieved by changing the length of the fixator telescope.	2.448952587077515
Axial corrections are performed by additive or subtractive techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures.	1.9541708212081461
Translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal "double angulation".	2.4394656090662763
Derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the "ring part" of a hybrid frame.	2.3664820900944794
Unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the nintramedullary nail.	2.0537376711117705
Pathomorphology in the preterm infant represents an interaction of morphological organ immaturity and neonatal management with their respective sequelae.	1.9559870270440671
Background: Morphological changes in the corneal surface after PRK may result not only in refraction fluctuations and reduction in visual acuity, but also in changes of contrast sensitivity.	2.170479068914655
The aim of this study was to investigate whether PRK has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars.	2.0840314304160867
Calcifying obliterative atherosclerosis isolated within the descending thoracic aorta causing subtotal vascular occlusion was associated with symptoms such as in aortic coarctation in a 56-year-old patient.	2.0270348372451745
Remarkable in this unique case is the atypical and isolated manifestation of atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic aorta, as well as the tumorous extent of luminal calcification.	2.139810783935254
Differential diagnostic considerations had to include calcifying tumor of the aorta, remnants after aortitis or secondary calcified aortic dissection.	2.1187682991105756
The osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be drainaged permanently or healed through an endonasal access.	2.0983649411331893
The obliteration of the frontal sinus is endangered in cases of multiple fracturing of the posterior frontal sinus wall or if it has been destroyed by an inflammatory process.	2.3859165283875545
In these problematic cases obliteration bears the danger of complications and cranialization of the frontal sinus is therefore the method of choice.	2.1354183130546214
We review 8 patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique.	2.472388464821799
Indications for surgery were a combined fracture of the anterior and posterior frontal sinus wall (3), a pyocele of the front sinus with extensive destruction of the posterior wall (4) and a large osteoma of the posterior frontal sinus wall (1).	2.597299958560005
The frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision, the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue.	2.1871134446089604
The anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants.	1.989524112680577
The follow up period was 1.8 years (11 months to 8 years).	2.317992475491408
All patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ENT-examination and radiological assessment by CT-scan or MRI.	2.055771706750831
The overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent.	2.271515259879217
There were no serious complications nor any recurrence.	2.199309379057989
The cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration.	2.211007529943272
We present the case of an infant with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, in whom keloids developed at the sites of intracutanous bleeding within 6 months after the illness.	2.1008402396484303
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs to the category of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA).	1.8736237562867788
The clinical picture is characterised by progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	2.159268200990068
Other common signs are slow saccades, external ophthalmoplegia, and pyramidal tract signs.	1.9969073239006556
The disease is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene for ataxin 7 on chromosome 3.	2.2258803707820114
SCA7 is a rare disorder.	3.471726225035719
The first case in Germany was described only recently.	2.3791857264392284
We report two additional patients, father and son, with the molecular genetic diagnosis of SCA7.	2.1707652145218517
The father carries a trinucleotide expansion of 42 CAG repeats, the son 51.	1.9795217160924239
Normal alleles range from 7 to 35 CAG repeats.	2.2106208124526088
Both patients show the typical picture with progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	2.129651588267488
We found a pronounced anticipation (earlier disease onset in subsequent generations), which is highly characteristic of CAG repeat disorders.	2.065644130620624
In the following contribution the under-proportional participation rate of older workers in vocational training is analysized.	1.841837671122427
Regarding the changes concerning the organiszation of vocational training to more job-integrated, self-directed and computerbased learning the consequences for training opportunities, motivation to learn and performance possibilities as well as institutional basic conditions to optimize the participation of elderly workers in further training are discussed.	1.811827087154601
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most severe arbovirus disease transmitted by ticks.	2.2604483962536954
The mortality of the central European form is 0.7-2%.	2.4892971997445685
Active immunisation is recommended for endemic regions.	2.580787751735998
We report on 4 patients with TBE aquired in Middle-Hessen between 1994 and 1997 (2 in 1997).	1.964786265945792
After repeated CSF and serum testing the TBE-specific antibodies were found in all 4 cases.	2.2640009251652655
In one case there was also evidence for a prior infection with borrelia burgdorferi.	2.1409605500408
The results of the initial CSF-analysis were atypical in 2 cases (high cell count of 136 cells/mm3, total protein up to 1.5 g/l).	1.9671392586236667
The endemic region for TBE has expanded in northern direction into Middle-Hessen, a region in which Lyme borreliosis is also endemic.	1.7780654381051462
Thus, true double infections are possible.	2.3088849756433683
Therefore, repetitive CSF and blood examinations are recommended.	2.2780214819492346
Nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of asthma.	2.617694888697495
Although they are chemically different, there are many similarities in their mechanism of action.	2.3649018366905716
In provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests (allergen, exercise), but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as So2 challenge.	1.8322926126311991
In children, only one study was done, showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium.	2.0116256849866296
Thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil, the other being proven effect of steroid- sparing, which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium.	2.0275225481524055
Both drugs are recommended as first-line agents in mild persistent asthma.	2.2904498932123967
Background: We evaluated in this retrospective study the impact of our diagnostic and therapeutic regimens - as illustrated by typical clinical pictures - on the frequency and prognostic values of postkeratoplasty complications in herpes eyes.	2.126662620368718
The evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy-induced benign changes following surgery and/or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology (cCT/MRI) or function (SPECT/PET).	1.9663403861377804
Current literature and the present data of our own patients demonstrate the diagnostic efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in the detection of recurrence and in-vivo grading.	2.1999249624310697
Thirty-nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow-up were studied by FDG-PET and IMT-SPECT.	2.3396841375841606
All high-grade recurrences could be confirmed by either methods.	2.69829586906177
IMT-SPECT showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low-grade tumors at recurrence.	2.4516292839824714
In contrast to IMT-SPECT, FDG-PET supports sufficient in-vivo grading.	2.0680671713748664
Both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radionecrosis.	2.7506210813578136
In conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade.	2.208663656982133
A 22-year-old male presented with a submandibular cystic mass in the ENT Clinic of Berlin-Buch.	2.4175634631342744
Histopathology revealed a dystopic papillary carcinoma in a thyroglossal duct cyst.	2.10586590219221
Worldwide only about 150 cases are known.	2.454749465967105
We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic procedures employed and included tumor excision, bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy.	2.0258346978850588
No abnormalities in the thyroid gland but a metastatic carcinoma was uncovered in an ipsilateral lymph node in the jugular foramen area.	2.0682409127391943
A preoperative 99 Tc-thyroid scan and MRI study had not shown any evidence for a malignant tumor.	2.050519809010074
The therapeutic approach advocated in literature is controversial but the intraoperative findings in our patient supported our decision to choose a relatively radical but not mutilating therapy.	1.9056721254088314
Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) is a pleiotrophic growth factor in carcinogenesis and regulars multiple cell functions.	2.4899169829470504
We wanted to evaluate the diagnostic meaning of TGF-1 plasma levels in patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer.	2.6176302751345943
The TGF-1 blood level was analysed in 394 patients.	2.2011848270673537
In 242 patients (group I) the blood was taken before any prostate manipulation and biopsy.	2.233003791524848
The TGF-1 plasma concentrations were almost similar in the group of patients with a prostate cancer (n = 157) and patients with a benign prostate hyperplasia (n = 85; 14 258 pg/ml versus 14 658 pg/ml, SD 10 516 pg/ml).	2.428656822854612
In 152 patients the blood was taken 6-12 months after radical prostatectomy (group II).	2.3204934650992497
There was no significant difference between the patients with a PSA-progress and without PSA-progress after.	2.406851239349507
Our results suggest that TGF-1 plasma levels can not be used to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia.	2.532819529852073
The aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria.	2.359291353380423
Moreover, the patients' motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined.	2.4377682248250996
228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies (ins), food intolerance (food), drug hypersensitivities (dru) and urticaria (urt) were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments.	1.810304066938242
Patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance.	2.0494727764115965
Patient education was the favourite technique for the patients (food 78%, urt 57%, dru 24%, ins 17%), followed by relaxation treatment.	2.1756748870317866
The most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self-responsibility, a feeling of helplessness and social limitations.	1.918351516340066
If strong indication criteria are applied, psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group.	2.2409998299523735
In spite of that, the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support.	2.2759963225623183
The definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp.	2.2510800794736125
At present all non-physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors, are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature.	1.8460741775131242
Many pesticides or insecticides or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and pollute our surface water.	1.8845837971175639
Here they may cause severe estrogenization of aquatic life.	2.3186486675518103
Only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water.	2.3679028435054286
On the other hand, weak estrogens present in plastic ware may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health.	1.7530039730033924
On the other hand, many plants produce socalled'hyto-estrogens', particularly soy products are rich in phyto-estrogens but their high consumption in Asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer.	1.7341178970955828
Many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto-estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of climacteric complaints.	2.156305747371133
Hence, not all endocrine disruptors must be harmful to human health, in fact, some of them (clearly phyto-estrogens) may have beneficial effects.	2.0383561880824304
Germany's new Protection against infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz) will take effect on January 1, 2001.	1.9321911753678984
It will result in an increase of notifications on reportable infections.	2.505944613593498
Counties and states have to adjust the infrastructure of their reportable disease notification systems to meet the demands of the new legislation.	2.0020300699212434
An increased demand for human resources at the non-medical staff level is anticipated.	2.255319755717161
Continuing education programs for medical and non-medical staff at public health offices are mandatory.	2.299674080650272
Physicians in private practice, hospitals and diagnostic laboratories and leaders of nursing homes are target groups for special information.	2.001177954192006
A timely review and epidemiological evaluation of all notifications forwarded by county health offices has to be performed at the state level.This is a prerogative for immediate response in case of non-localized increases in reported disease incidence.	2.225649348737144
The author advocates the development of an epidemiological rapid reaction scheme (epidemiological fire brigade) in which public health physicians at the county, state, and federal level cooperate in a gradual response to outbreak situations according to actual demand.	1.778110342769496
We report on an 8 year old boy and a 12 year old girl with intermittent peranal loss of blood and mucus, impaired defecation and recurrent abdominal pain.	2.074423766416629
On endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only, whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically.	2.30169874420959
Biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae.	2.0621823940572295
These clinical, endoscopical and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.	2.1046125685746766
Only 26 paediatric cases (age at diagnosis 6-9 years) have been published so far.	2.6100014142426273
The interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis (mean: 3,7 years, range: 1 week to 9 years) is remarkably long in childhood cases.	2.067890987029842
Pathogenetically an internal rectal prolapse with secondary ischemic lesions is assumed.	2.126674506339838
There is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease.	2.2719554810673928
The ulcers ars often resistant to different medical and surgical options.	2.285129564704541
Discussion: Pediatricians should be aware of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in order to make an earlier diagnosis and to prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and concerns of patients and their parents about more severe illnesses.	2.2086672949861574
A typology of chronic illness in childhood and adolescence is developed.	2.262489950763798
In a comparative analysis of 29 studies, maximal androgen deprivation (MAD) was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation.	2.249192520164845
Thus, MAD cannot be regarded as the new gold standard.	2.444394360660259
Most trials focus on quality of life which - given the palliative aim of the treatment - deserves special attention.	2.6252441597080565
This aspect has not yet been evaluated, however, in the largest multicenter study, Intergroup study 0105.	2.7733024370731862
In patients with advanced bone metastasis or severe pain, MAD treatment should be begun because of the flare phenomenon.	2.3737721535755667
The synergistic effects of LHRH agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated.	2.2327739385733327
Since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum-PSA levels under MAD does not delay progression, the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not MAD should be begun.	2.064907661063468
A case of generalized maculopapular rash and local indurated plaques following s.c. injections of either low-molecular-weight heparin or conventional (high-molecular-weight) heparin to a 75-year-old woman is reported.	1.872620826501532
This rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed.	2.5317767428185967
Perioperative morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery are mainly due to cardiovascular complications.	2.482476236191329
Therefore, perioperative risk assessment is crucial to avoid these adverse events.	2.2947177544128903
In patients above the age of 40 years, the ECG is a basic investigation, often providing hints for cardiovascular diseases.	2.2250538644564717
Stress testing and, in special cases, stress echocardiography or scintigraphy (the latter only in those patients, in which exercise is impossible) can detect significant coronary artery disease.	2.1939871760590326
The vascularization reduced the perioperative risk in particular in those patients with unstable angina or severe coronary artery disease.	2.551940610258562
However, prophylactic revascularization the stable patient does not improve overall outcome, because the risk of the revascularizing procedure must be added to the risk of noncardiac surgery.	2.400435741742408
Other diagnostic procedures like echocardiography, chest roentgenogram, routine scintigraphy, halter ECG or halter blood pressure measurement do not add information to the perioperative risk assessment, although these techniques might be very relevant in evaluating other coexisting diseases (heart failure; valve lesions, in particular aortic stenoses etc.)	1.8822685724878245
and can be useful to improve medical treatment preoperatively (e.g.	2.497680512214615
normalization of blood pressure).	3.1326126986240523
A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old woman who had been suffering from interstitial cystitis with Hunner's ulcer for 10 years.	1.9901403494532768
Up to now, only 7 cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis have been reported.	2.0546009246845753
Although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far, the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation.	2.6026954517414747
After conservative management had failed, a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed.	1.9777757549523693
The characteristics of interstitial cystitis, verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed.	2.109503235411313
Introduction: Abdominal actinomycosis is an uncommon disease.	2.579262405374552
Nevertheless it should be considered in case of unclear tumor-like abdominal masses.	2.9752466839461755
Methods: We report a case of a 49-year-old patient with an intrauterine device.	2.9404330583932863
The patient was submitted with a solid and painful tumor in the upper abdomen.	2.295552077789438
After sonography, computerized tomography, gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy the preoperative presumptive diagnosis was a carcinoma of the transvers colon invading the abdominal wall.	2.0500911098790966
Pathological examination after a right hemicolectomy surprisingly revealed an actinomycosis.	2.1653624360312023
Results: Based on this case diagnostic tools and therapeutic options of actinomycosis of the colon are discussed.	2.403244192759083
Conclusions: This case illustrates the importance to consider the possibility of actinomycosis when finding an unclear abdominal mass.	2.2094441493405665
After a surgical excision an abdominal actinomycosis requires antibiotic therapy.	2.1440592034803245
Long-term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenias requires integration of many therapeutic approaches, co-operation of several professions, and regard for the views of patients and relatives.	2.2565274355114453
This review deals with practical aspects of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive resp.	2.03981893969312
psychological treatments, social resp.	2.634916323431001
milieu therapy, rehabilitation, interventions based on the concept of Expressed Emotions (EE), psychoeducation and work with relatives.	2.1426201407927623
Continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration.	2.477045050685226
Indications for adding on antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed, as well as treatment of negative symptoms, depression and management of treatment-resistant symptoms.	2.1034249181912585
Psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient.	2.607156263824966
In the context of a stable long-term relationship, the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action.	2.527945980430322
Effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited.	2.4336104649044352
The best results are achieved by social skills training.	2.150423724767495
Social therapy, which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient, is of paramount importance.	2.6801178943099053
Improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long-term social rehabilitation.	2.291281268906978
Interventions based on the EE concept are highly effective, but are rarely used.	2.5258250420508355
Programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective.	2.0016509647791425
The functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained, the integrative role of case-management is stressed.	2.2043377148489465
The effect of a locally applied peppermint oil preparation on tension-type headache was examined in the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study for the first time.	2.092524988467085
The preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and to the corresponding placebo.	2.321454981029462
The liquid test preparation contained 10 g of peppermint oil and ethanol (90 %) ad 100 (test preparation LI 170, Lichtwer Pharma, Berlin); the placebo was a 90 % ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil were added for blinding purposes.	1.6467329676587361
The reference preparation contained 500 mg acetaminophen; the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance.	1.938450128385591
The study included the analysis of 164 headache attacks of 41 patients of both sexes ranging between 18 and 65 years of age, suffering from tension-type headache in accordance with the IHS classification.	2.1473712074823337
Four headache episodes per patient were treated in a double-blind, randomized crossover design.	2.2692897348391106
Each headache attack was treated by the application of 2 capsules of the oral medication (1000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo) and the cutaneous application of the oil preparation (peppermint oil or placebo solution).	2.307650323347244
The oil was spread largely across forehead and temples which was repeated after 15 and 30 minutes.	1.9298823552691722
Using a headache diary, the headache parameters were assessed after 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes.	2.036843556765599
Compared to the application of placebo, a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes (p < 0.01).	1.9752161422070653
This significant clinical reduction of the pain intensity continued over the one hour observation period.	2.3970019623870815
Acetaminophen, too, proved to be efficient compared to placebo (p < 0.01).	2.3579336420550443
There was no significant difference between the efficacy of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution.	1.989095502388197
Simultaneous application of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution leads to an additive effect which remains below the significance threshold, however.	1.860597180840594
The patients reported no adverse events.	2.3897756463472666
This controlled study showed for the first time that a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution efficiently alleviates tension-type headache.	2.0484892209707977
Peppermint oil thus proves to be a well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative to usual therapies.	2.7773269382785553
The positive results of several multi-center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years.	2.219883646156485
It was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease.	2.244712707694852
To improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice, a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the German-speaking European countries.	2.2831102842562094
Dislocated metacarpal V fractures, fixed by percutaneous Kirschner wires or other implants near the metacarpophalangeal joint, often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings.	1.7878323038249258
We therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to Foucher.	1.995870828941301
Twenty-five patients were operated on in a 3-year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined.	2.636849726367367
Six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction.	2.247512648828894
One patient suffering from an early stage of Sudeck's dystrophy was healed, and no other complications appeared.	2.343827326859094
Three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment.	2.347534504816287
We therefore recommend intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal V fractures.	2.080458804753343
Aspiration of toxic substances, foreign material, bacterially contaminated secretions, or water (near-drowning) either immediately leads to cessation of respiration or to impaired ventilation due to airway obstruction, it causes hypoxia due to surfactant dysfunction, and pulmonary infection might develop.	1.7159178408029094
Respiratory insufficiency is the resulting consequence which needs immediate and appropriate therapy and intervention.	2.054363012682834
The knowledge of risk factors that promote aspiration injury is important for its prevention and limitation.	2.2395425305174514
Mortality varies between 3 and 70% depending on patients studied, and on the nature and amount of aspirated material.	2.254621103981968
The major cause of death is acute respiratory failure.	2.3963525960808547
The onset of injury to the lung after aspiration is very rapid.	2.20858618229026
Therefore, therapeutic interventions like bronchoscopy are often too late.	2.1420291422217246
More importantly, oxygenation should be monitored continuously for timely institution of mechanical ventilation.	2.1514118615137647
Antibiotics should not be given routinely but a calculated regime is neccessary when signs of infection develop.	2.131922688954898
Prognosis in near-drowning considerably depends on early rescue and successful resuscitation.	2.1166344401022927
A rapid onset of cerebral hypothermia during the accident can help to increase the ischemic tolerance of the brain and makes it neccessary to continue advanced life support until rewarming of the near-drowning victim.	2.0063345129565553
Anticipation of individual outcome in unconscious patients is difficult.	2.3917003367426957
One third of them survive with a moderate to severe neurologic damage.	2.155859245498049
The overall mortality of near-drowning is about 11%.	2.2350060118637436
Pathophysiological aspects, diagnostic procedures, pratical management and possible prophylaxis of aspiration injuries will be discussed.	2.1116169571371532
Background: Semiquantitative classification of corneal topography after penetrating keratoplasty has the potential for focusing information about the areal dioptric power of the cornea.	2.231784849909586
The purpose of this study was to objectify the procedure of manual semiquantitative classification using a Fourier transform of corneal topography power data and to correlate both methods.	1.8785648842862597
Recently, professional anaesthesiologists organizations, have set up recommendations for intraoperative monitoring.	2.049061180751886
These recommendations are based upon the assumption that anaesthesia-related deaths are largely preventable and that extensive monitoring will reduce mortality.	2.0924129707677337
Hypoxaemia appears to be an important pathophysiological mechanism, and this is why oxygen monitoring is given a high priority in safety standards in anaesthesia.	2.2478889329827325
However, no reduction in mortality has been definitively shown to follow the use of any monitoring device in randomized, controlled trials.	2.2870575802084234
Four techniques of oxygen monitoring are discussed and evaluated.	2.43769765415488
Oxygen monitoring during inspiration can be recommended, although its implementation will probably prevent only a few anaesthesia-related deaths.	2.214797969511231
Pulse oximetry is certainly highly recommended, but also has some deficiencies which are not sufficiently well known considering the popularity of this technique.	2.212521432742975
Transcutaneous PO2 is considered mainly for historical reasons.	2.2593862170855417
Near infrared spectrometry is a new technique offering noninvasive and continuous monitoring of intracerebral oxygenation.	2.3045185408236724
The increasing frequency of stent implantation into coronary arteries is based mainly on assumptions.	2.213282033544948
One of these assumptions is that stents may prevent restenosis.	2.061302398435323
Despite the very tight selection of patients suitable for stent implantation in these two studies, the advantage for stents remained small (about 10% less restenosis) and appeared to decrease with time following intervention.	1.976616971371704
There is increasing concern about the extension of stenting in an "unrestricted strategy".	2.0236863237718814
This concern was expressed in the ACC Expert Consensus Document which was published recently (JACC 28, No 3, September 1996: 782-794.	1.7980702264047908
Based on the lack of data for most of the presently used stent indications the expert group recommended a more selective strategy for the implantation of stents into coronary arteries.	2.141148334855321
Removal of the arterial sheath immediately after PTCA is desirable for patients, reduces the medical staff's workload, and may decrease hospital costs due to a shortened length of stay.	2.2054044155665293
Although the safety and efficacy of the hemostatic systems used especially for the above purpose have been sufficiently documented, inadvertent intraluminal vascular occlusion is theoretically possible.	1.8891496869490696
While partial or complete arterial occlusion in conjunction with the VasoSeal collagen prototype device has been previously reported, similar complications occurring with the Angio-SealTM device were not published.	1.8941359408812928
In this report, we describe a 54-year old female patient (height: 150 cm, weight: 42.5 kg) who was transferred for PTCA following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.	2.0340239099866455
Immediately after PTCA, the Angio-SealTM device was deployed utilizing standard technique.	1.9798067220392295
No difficulties were encountered during device deployment, however, immediately following device placement active arterial bleeding occurred.	2.1806563997971233
Due to the inadequacy of hemostasis, heparin was reversed with protamine to avoid further hemorrhagic complications.	1.7991432453771714
Following this, the desired hemostasis quickly occurred, but the patient soon complained about symptoms suggestive of an acute occlusion of the right femoral artery.	2.590336523386484
Unsatisfactory attempts as lysis resulted in the patient being transferred to vascular surgery.	2.327215877407052
The complete Angio-SealTM system (anchor including collagen) was located intravasculary, and removed during surgery.	1.9359902896803278
Deviations in the axes can be physiological or pathological.	2.205671046329968
The femoral neck-shaft-angle decreases from 150 ° on average at birth to 120 ° on average at the end of growth.	2.104260685855456
The lower leg is bowed in a varus direction at birth.	2.077611499580633
On the basis of an extensive literature search (DIMDI, MEDLINE - status at June 1992), the causes of contact urticaria so far known are displayed in tables.	1.9609572167521987
The contact urticariogens can be divided into (1) chemically defined substances and (2) chemically undefined biological materials.	2.435124170247233
The causes most frequently encountered in 16 professions are given.	2.3038636520387383
Numerous agents are known for medical professions (physicians, nurses, dentists and dental technicians, veterinary surgeons).	1.895152698056898
Today, the most frequent single cause of contact urticaria is probably the presence of latex proteins in rubber (gloves, condoms, tubes, balloons, etc.).	2.15324591245436
When testing is performed a stepwise approach is recommended for safety reasons (rub test, prick test, scratch chamber test).	1.938768651067379
For some contact urticariogens a commercial radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is available.	2.0157433952563206
In the cases reported in the literature it is not always possible to decide definitely whether the pathogenetic mechanism was immunologic (IgE mediated) or non-immunologic (toxic or pseudoallergic).	2.121799352721286
When there is a high degree of sensitization (e.g.	2.5081388947704255
to latex) professional activities must be severely restricted, or even completely discontinued in rare cases.	2.0395724780855624
Purpose: To find and describe potential MRI criteria of nutrient vessel canals of carpal bones.	1.8983328514509172
2-Agonists are being used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine because of their antihypertensive, analgesic and sedative properties.	2.2078140293531447
Platelets bear 2-receptors on the cell surface.	2.3407288571787768
Stimulation of these receptors by agonists induces platelet aggregation.	2.3635248268319855
Prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians.	2.3950973644281004
Acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain.	2.256821296023627
The basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia, the clinical symptoms, the diagnostic tools and the preclinically available therapeutic options.	2.6146995523896726
Time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30-60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in 3 to 6 hours.	2.0666791170332184
With 30% of patients dying within the first hour of ischemia mostly due to ventricular arrhyhtmias every effort needs to be made to shorten the delay between symptom onset and start of reperfusion therapy.	2.11501965456763
The present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of preclincial diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or PTCA.	2.096758514667617
The aim of surgical intervention in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the achievement of normocalcemia and euparathyreosis.	2.5088697351635334
Despite improved diagnostic procedures containing comparatively modified pre- and intraoperative methods to determine the position of the parathyroid glands and the most efficient operative technique including minimal-invasive surgery thereof, success cannot be guaranteed.	2.1346956035245883
Success is based on the four pillars of the HPT surgery: history, embryology with anatomy, neck surgery and experience.	2.1395310014407056
By means of this principle and the results of surgical treatment in 1634 patients with pHPT from 1982 until 1998, we demonstrate a standardized operative technique of pHPT.	2.1258905160243136
A 67-year-old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome.	2.7350425341722246
Biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary glo-merulopathy on light and electron micros-copy.	1.937104204796561
Other non-nephritic causes of a nephrotic syndrome (e.g.	2.0742341337727637
amyloidosis, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, light-chain glomerulopathy, cryoglobulinaemia, collagen-III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy) could be excluded.	1.947215830105662
Besides the case report, differential diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulopathies is presented.	2.678148969590174
Two patients were infected with sporotrichosis; one had the fixed cutaneous form, the other the lymphocutaneous form.	2.058394808655468
Sporotrichosis schenckii was identified in both with a culture from a tissue biopsy.	2.190563429460668
Both patients were successfully treated with itraconazole, one received 100 mg and the other 200 mg itraconazole daily over a 3 months period.	2.0457371786452234
Abstract   Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent that has recently been shown to be effective in ameliorating disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) as indicated by clinical and MRI data.	2.0524808302448867
However, the role of mitoxantrone in escalating treatment of patients with frequent and severe relapses and with rapid progression of disability is less clear.	2.2481884052591354
In this retrospective analysis we report on 15 patients with severe relapsing-remitting (9 patients) and secondary progressive MS with superimposed exacerbations (6 patients) treated openlabeled with mitoxantrone in our Clinical Research Group from July 1994 to October 1998.	1.9658009508528766
Eleven of these patients (73%) were treated with azathioprine, interferon-beta-1b or cyclophosphamide before.	2.6296066960364137
The patients received mitoxantrone over a period of at least 12 months (19 +/- 6 months) with a single dose of 10 mg/m2 monthly for the first three months.	2.739750392427365
Thereafter, infusions were repeated every 3 months (total dose 141 mg +/- 45 mg).	2.100318711415494
The annual relapse rate could be significantly reduced from 3,0 +/- 1,5 in the year before therapy to 0,5 +/- 0,5 during therapy.	2.369615644167204
Nine patients (60%) were stabilised, while four patients (27%) showed an improvement of disability.	2.3079866638061466
The treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects.	2.292510580009434
These results although retrospectively obtained confirm previous trials showing that mitoxantrone may be useful in MS patients with frequent and severe exacerbations and/or a rapidly progressive course of the disease who have had other immunomodulatory medication.	2.1324912184533305
Interstitial cystitis (IC) represents a rare and complex inflammatory bladder condition in which diagnostics can be challenging.	2.0104063981447244
Strict NIH criteria for its diagnosis were designed for research purposes.	2.2763417907052563
Their routine application would miss large proportions of IC patients.	2.1271700768190036
When IC is suspected, history and physical exam are followed by an evaluation of long-term voiding diaries.	2.5251027318614137
Large voided volumes (functional capacity >250 cc) or longer micturition intervals (>2 h.), absence of nocturia or symptom-free periods reduce the likelihood of IC.	1.904058869159288
Further exclusion diagnostics include urine tests (infection), cytology (in-situ carcinoma), ultrasound (calculi, bulks, anomalies) and urodynamics in selected cases.	1.7663294623818904
Bladder capacity measurements under sedoanalgesia are of limited value, since functional low-volume bladders can be mechanically extendable.	1.9116403649348759
Cystoscopy under general anesthesia represents the diagnostic standard procedure for IC during which 90% of IC-patients present with characteristic mucosal glomerulations after bladder distension.	1.8991271222782387
Biopsies are recommended for exclusion of malignancy.	2.635576675757058
Similarly, complex determinations of novel IC markers (histamine, tryptase, cytokines, growth factors, substance P, nitric oxide) are of no relevance in clinical settings and should be restricted to research projects.	1.9466723093105889
According to semiotics, which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of signs, objects, and interpretants, pain is considered to be a sign (significant) with very different meanings (significance) either as a naturalistic symptom (of disease) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context.	1.9629871984630471
When following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms.	2.4194654811440413
In Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body.	2.0211802331843542
Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception.	1.996807977041725
It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor).	1.850867611789848
He also coined the term µK to characterize an attack of migraine.	2.014282296493809
In algotherapy, Galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology.	2.013212164981518
In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B. C.), pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the hero's leg like an identification tag, whereas in Virgil's Aeneids (1st century B. C.) pain symbolizes weakness and defencelessness which can only be alleviated by the goddess Venus.	1.7102976231336944
Attention is mainly focused on detection of residual curarisation.	2.2922160286865276
New insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed.	2.0830133498858596
Surprisingly in this context, despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring, its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine.	2.3847375742404693
A lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring.	2.176090292011466
Three patients presented with an acquired green discoloration of their scalp hair.	2.2541748392061924
History revealed that all of them swam regularly in private swimming pools.	2.1779643894875607
Examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed that the green discoloration was caused by an excessively high copper content of the hair.	2.3512223775534555
This exogeneous discoloration is characteristically related to the uptake of copper from private swimming pools.	2.1481324662705075
A 62-year-old female patient presented with bullous, intensely itching cutaneous lesions, which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease).	1.9660635969378726
Because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly, a lymph node biopsy was taken.	2.1391232431099914
Histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis: angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-type T-cell lymphoma.	2.4065878955237836
Intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma.	2.103142467594843
These skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations.	2.3534918023107494
This case report is the first report of AILD with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature.	2.188660838212473
Background: The procedures for prophylaxis and treatment of keratopathy following facial palsy with lagophthalmos are unsatisfying from the functional point of view.	2.0093228435644908
The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0.2-T MRI unit and a 1.0-T MRI unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament.	2.4823741071818355
Twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent MRI of the knee on both 0.2-T and 1.0-T MRI units.	2.5942377285103393
Three independent observers evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.	2.500589449897118
Frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities, and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic.	2.016575508918553
In 8 patients the 1.0 T unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament; in these patients the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 1/8 cases (12 %), and secondary signs in 3/8 cases (37 %).	2.245689967989973
Observer agreement was very good for the 1.0-T unit and fair for the 0.2-T unit.	2.1778251340355563
There is no substantial difference between 1.0-T units and 0.2-T MRI units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament.	2.0377043740519407
In the visualisation of secondary signs, 1.0-T units are superior to 0.2-T units, and there is a surprisingly high rate of false-positive results with the 0.2-T unit.	2.431316701027559
As to the reproducibility of the results, the 1.0-T unit is far superior to the 0.2-T unit.	2.44871695830596
3-5 paraffin-embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks of 149 clinical stage I NSGCT were available from all patients and were analyzed for histopathological features associated with pathological stage: presence/absence of vascular invasion, presence/absence of tunical invasion, percentage of each histological cell type present in the primary tumor.	1.9065877466028094
Immunohistochemical expression of MIB-1, p53, bcl-2, cathepsin D and e-cadherin was evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring ystem.	2.02293046537992
Statistical analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.	2.323669945906701
Percentage of embryonal carcinoma [%EC (p < 0.001)] and presence of vascular invasion [VI (p < 0.0001)] were the most significant independent risk factors associated with pathological stage II disease.	2.2645410732640143
Combination of %EC and VI allowed correct prediction of final pathological stage in 88 % of patients.	2.0347529624375795
Cut-off values including both variables identified correct pathological stage in 131/149 patients (88 %).	1.9675355612031322
Less than 45 % EC and absence of VI correctly identified pathological stage I disease in 91.5 %; more than 80 % EC and presence of VI correctly predicted pathological stage II in 88 % of the patients.	1.9891945852254342
%EC and presence/absence of VI appear to be reliable prognosticators to identify both patients at high risk and at low risk for occult retroperitoneal disease.	2.162747458349187
P53, bcl-2, MIB-1, cathepsin D and e-cadherin did not appear to be of prognostic value in clinical stage I NSGCT.	2.1739437956757834
In the framework of rheumatic illnesses, the lungs and pleura are often observed to be involved.	2.229175981453639
Dependent on the basic illness in question, conditions of the bronchoalveolar system, vessels, lymphatic system, and pleura that have developed differently inter- and intraindividually can be diagnosed in toporegionally variable forms and combinations.	1.9215351648772396
In the causal pathogenesis, the initial (auto-)immunological alteration of the alveolar septa plays a role.	2.1954475280470787
The incidence and manifestation forms of lung changes show certain differences dependent on the underyling illness (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic scleroderma, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, Sjögren syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease).	1.9442255272815456
In addition to vasculitis and granulomatosis of the lung, therapy-induced lung changes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis since almost all basic therapeutic agents can cause this type of lung condition.	2.1587406083919958
Good knowledge of the parameters from the viewpoint of possible therapeutic measures is indispensable, as is close cooperation between the treating physician and the pathologist.	2.2202608141133546
Scintigraphic imaging identifies pathophysiological processes; in other words it assesses regional perfusion, permeability, leukocytic accumulation and bone turnover.	1.886332983260183
These processes precede morphological changes and this accounts for the high sensitivity of nuclear medicine procedures as well as the low specificity for the differential diagnosis of different diseases with similar pathophysiological characteristics.	2.347703212950427
This review (1) describes and evaluates the currently used scintigraphic procedures, (2) suggests their differential use in certain clinical settings in comparison with alternative radiological methods and (3) addresses new developments in diagnosis using nuclear medicine procedures.	2.13349085788699
In summary, we advise dynamic bone scanning as a primary scintigraphic investigation.	2.09663498262491
A negative scan excludes osteomyelitis in most cases.	2.376717132925298
The comparison is made with conventional radiology and clinical history.	2.2838438915173085
In cases with short clinical histories ( = granulocytic inflammation), leukocyte scintigraphy should be the next diagnostic step; in chronic processes (lymphomonocytic inflammation), gallium scintigraphy is advisable.	1.8694807992354479
Other scintigraphic methods might be of additional use in experienced hands.	2.2854170688252404
SPECT is useful for clarifying inconclusive planar scans of the head, spine and large joints.	2.2194603223097213
To assess the clinical effectiveness of glaucoma therapy with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation, 106 eyes (51 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma, 22 eyes with secondary glaucoma, 10 eyes with narrow-angle glaucoma, 23 eyes with other glaucomas) of 87 patients were treated.	1.8253697695342144
Using a diode laser coupled with a fiberoptic probe, ending in a focusing tip, all eyes were treated with 24-30 spots over 360  ° and 2.8-3.6 J of energy, 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus.	1.7995505443965512
The intraocular pressure was obtained over a period of time until 8-24 months after operation.	2.649790098334956
Additionally, morphological changes of the ciliary body were observed in 25 eyes by means of ultrasound biomicroscopy.	2.5845322277572556
Our objective was to determine the efficacy of ESWL treatment in children and the extent of auxiliary measures.	3.1662683177948865
In a retrospective analysis we investigated number of auxiliary measures and the stone-free rate in children after ESWL treatment.	1.9419150117999913
We report a 44-year-old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures.	2.6670357149153068
This tumor represents a special entity of nephroblastoma that rarely occurs in adults.	1.996709527436477
There is no unanimous opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor behaves differently.	1.9050997502128726
The question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open.	2.1941633725710226
The decision depends on the given case.	2.7915712819730665
Nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue.	2.3107419201838817
The safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows fingerlike spread into the surrounding tissue.	2.0115352608883423
Determination of oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) describes the activity of anaerobic vs aerobic metabolism.	2.0180022606571586
An incremental exercise test measuring gas exchange, ventilation and lactate release was performed in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders.	2.467622648294697
At rest as well as during exercise patients with mitochondrial disorders differ from healthy subjects with regard to gas exchange and ventilation parameters.	2.5421396187748173
During exercise, the decreased oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle and early activation of anaerobic metabolism in these patients are mirrored by a reduced anaerobic threshold, reduced maximal oxygen uptake and reduced oxygen pulse.	1.9984085770406674
Our study shows that CPX is a sensitive and practical clinical screening method of investigating mitochondrial disorders.	2.0071580897487946
Monitoring of pH of the esophagus is a routine diagnostic procedure, whereas until now pH-monitoring of the hypopharynx has been used only for scientific research.	2.209823077393796
In the present study a critical evaluation scale was used to record the results of 112 patients who underwent pH monitoring to determine possible reflux.	2.4609971888958797
Since high refluxes often remain unnoticed clinically, further study is required in certain cases.	2.1620292016043074
The extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx.	2.235566473730086
In such cases 24-h pH monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of "gastric laryngitis".	2.252442151272007
The occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes.	2.1193973555668144
In babies and infants, these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia.	1.9752340953000425
Viral infections and/or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults (adult giant cell hepatitis, AGCH), which is much rarer.	2.3208474121259184
In some of the cases, there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses.	2.573234536794061
Giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of HIV infection.	2.9183903293389406
These both indicate an infectious cause.	2.3804333210985544
However, the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees.	2.319974952228375
In addition, the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient.	2.117673184696384
This autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient, especially since a hepatitis A infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here.	1.943288958011715
In patients with a significant elongation of the ACL we propose a new therapeutic regimen.	2.549996469309605
After mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the ACL we pull the bone block with the attached ACL distally.	2.1410401736567146
Thus the ACL is easily tightened.	2.4204613708659592
In accordance with this method, we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the ACL: the tibial insertion is mobilised, the bone block with the attached ACL removed from the joint.	2.7030093095629475
Ex vivo sutures are placed into the ACL, the ligament is pulled back into the joint, and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block.	2.454272978764214
Purpose: One aspect of biocompatibility of IOLs can be tested using specular microscopy of the anterior and posterior surface of the lens in vivo.	2.115971957904325
Background: The paper focuses on the issues, how couples cope with SIDS and how this can be facilitated by subsequent children, self-help and professional support.	1.981099306616298
Methods: In a retrospective study, 60 couples, members of a self-help organization, were studied at the average of 5 years (2-215 months) after their loss.	2.2366300321499577
Depression, anxiety, physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires.	2.221266611130215
A community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls.	2.229048972126054
Results: Average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample.	2.379556606646846
Men and women coped differently with the loss: Bereft mothers were more depressed and ruminated more about cause and preventability of the death than fathers.	1.7903653104849844
They expressed their grief more openly and found it more helpful to speak about their loss.	1.8693950698958672
The presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss; an early subsequent pregnancy was fraught with increased anxiety.	1.9243224927011213
Conclusions: The self-help group serves an important function as a coping resource; the pediatrician plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families.	2.1342688968295622
A 63-year-old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine.	2.2463434246211826
This reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema.	2.163331550465027
We discuss the signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine-induced livedo reticularis.	2.314599851963423
Despite the diagnostic criteria of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, the term borderline has been used in a non-specific way for a long time.	2.5832980152809037
For our investigation we constructed a questionnaire, which contained the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder (BPD), plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder.	2.1795857587685776
The two additional criteria for the BPD used by the DSM-IV were added.	2.44574637360724
800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria, which they thought were typical for the BPD.	2.1002689147470095
By using the operational diagnostic approach for ICD-10 and DSM-IV a disorder was diagnosed from each of the 162 received questionnaires based on the marked criteria.	2.1770697672340087
92,0% of the questionnaires contained marked criteria for the diagnosis of the BPD by ICD-10 and 96,3% by DSM-IV.	2.2927496675411567
In addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis.	2.1008779018452333
This is a sign for the difficulty to separate the BPD from other personalitiy disorders or the schizotype  disorder by using operationalised criteria.	1.9171558197582106
Looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality  disorders, e.g.	2.2141226930924014
for the BPD which has been discussed by many authors for years, modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered.	2.550255525380851
Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior.	2.4410665971655865
The efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has been questioned.	2.2254506928618896
Opened and controlled investigations have shown risperidone is effective for reducing self-injurious behaviour in mentally retardation.	1.9781064225087275
We report about 3 mentally retarded patients which were given open-label riperidone for 12 weeks.They participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the repititive behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule (DAS).	1.7085904465059278
Purpose: To test the capabilities of vacuum core biopsy (VCB) in the diagnosis of mammographically indeterminate lesions.	2.353543576262307
Materials and Methods: 120 patients (131 lesions) were examined using VCB with 14G or 11G vacuum core.	1.9857152463274976
Radiologic information systems (RIS) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are becoming increasingly widespread.	1.959695294899269
This leads to new demands on the integration of the individual, formerly independent information systems (RIS, modalities, PACS).	2.11955181251576
Possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced.	2.1851166829874367
Besides the detailed description of different realizations of system communication, its role in the PACS at the university hospital in Freiburg is explained.	2.022517783145055
The integration of different information systems still requires the use of proprietary interfaces.	2.498514773180025
An appropriate integration generally has been realized in Freiburg.	2.197787481443814
In the near future DICOM basic worklist management will standardize system integration and render an interdepartmental workflow concept possible.	1.798847116596688
Even though an available communication standard exists, not all problems in the RIS-modality interface are solved.	1.9743058826272346
Different data models in the various RI systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard.	1.9787355665759117
Thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard.	2.019949147621261
Background: Denecke developed 1957 a surgical strategy consisting of three or four operative steps for rehabilitation of patients with unilateral paralysis of IXth and Xth cranial nerve.	2.0525310524021676
These four steps are the following: myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle, resection of the paralyzed pharyngeal wall, medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord and fixation of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall which can be facultative.	2.154661381589817
Reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient.	2.2284303742580267
Our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure, by creation of two opposing trapezoidal skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body; the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the linea alba.	1.8272638242825634
Reconstruction has been successfully carried out in this way after melanoma excision in 7 patients.	2.39769787929677
Mammography is an established diagnostic procedure for breast cancer.	2.560235854525257
Data concerning screening mammography are available from nine prospectively controlled trials, the largest series being presented from Sweden.	1.9563069881117792
Mammographic screening leads to a significant reduction of breast cancer of 30 % in women ages 50-59 years.	2.469633760336214
In younger women (40-49 years) the benefit accounts to only 20 % and has not proven to be statistically significant.	2.170108608886774
Nevertheless, the major advantage of mammographic screening is detection of the non-palpable tumor <= 10 mm in size.	2.3819217822662337
The treatment of these small breast carcinomas leads to long-term survival rates of >= 90 %.	2.6044328335787665
Mammographic screening programs have been introduced in the USA, Canada, Iceland and Sweden for women in their 5th decade of life.	1.9942345128615995
Starting yearly lifelong mammography-screening at the age of 40, the theoretical cancer induction by radiation exposure does not exceed 0.1 %.	1.9951125400467686
Under highly qualified conditions, it should be possible to minimize false-positive and false-negative screening results.	2.2253151815553425
In Germany, screening-mammography is only introduced in patients at high risk for breast cancer.	2.2528085416328096
Based on medical data, mammography must be a part of screening for women with an average risk - starting at the age of 40, although there are still open questions needing further clinical research.	2.142697132086391
Upper lid closure in facial nerve paresis induced lagophthalmos is often improved by implantation of gold weights.	1.9670775824533886
However, the tolerability of gold implants has not always met expectations.	1.9913176997909892
We therefore investigated whether results could be improved by implantation of well-tolerated platinum implants.	2.2310129579826374
Methods to determine the mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures are valuable tools in wound healing research.	2.3204937547819515
So far standardized testing procedures have not been defined in the surgical literature, which reduces the comparability of results from different authors.	2.1189350717572384
Therefore we suggest a modified tensile testing procedure which follows German industrial standards (DIN 53 455).	1.814333368454282
The experimental set-up includes an universal testing machine and special clamps.	2.020238070979606
The dumbbell-shaped specimen consist of freshly prepared pig skin and the suture which is to be tested.	2.1159657715358136
Well-known mechanical properties of surgical sutures and wounds were used to approve the precision of the experimental set-up.	2.1515471790565788
Reproducible analysis of all tested sutures and wounds (n = 120) was possible.	2.2457054967128673
We recommend testing procedures adapted to industrial standards to obtain comparable results in determination of mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures.	1.903866279125434
Abstract  An infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to a large variety of complications affecting almost every organ system.	2.11801239484107
With the increasing numbers of HIV infections, some authors have reported an occasional association between an infection with HIV and arterial aneurysm.	1.9961397826854048
However, complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare.	2.1899291503394167
Partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance.	2.133585179621555
It may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation.	2.213883532013682
Although this is well established, nasogastric tubes are commonly used, because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure.	2.2094720614178835
A new technique for fixing orogastric tubes was tested in a prospective study in 11 preterm and term infants over a 4 weeks period.	2.16595720393064
There was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in 7 patients.	2.1498252383623453
The orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in 3 patients and only 1 patiend aged 15 weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube.	2.1530563484264773
On the basis of a 3 days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86,2% for all patients and 92,5% for patients below 8 weeks of age.	2.003916888417692
Mesenchymal neoplasms of lipogenic differentiation are the most common soft-tissue neoplasms in adults.	2.5702905417098516
In recent years a number of "new" entities and variants have been described.	2.4608180198212692
Their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy.	2.3144752075896218
Despite high-grade morphology cutaneous liposarcomas carry a favorable clinical prognosis.	2.244612452333372
Spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour (well-differentiated liposarcoma) and must be distinguished from dedifferentiated liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma.	2.0435411865750375
The advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes.	2.051885826241266
The intracranial space is divided into two large compartments by the tentorium.	2.3279623828883587
The hydrostatic pressure of spinal fluid is responsible for buoyancy of the brain within these compartments.	2.2845745538721594
In patients with craniectomy this equilibrium is exposed to atmospheric pressure.	2.0735514837550086
We report on four cases of reversible herniation after either bilateral or unilateral decompressive craniectomy performed for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and failure of conservative ICP treatment.	1.7935326543000962
All were successfully weaned from the ventilator and awake and CT scans showed no space-occupying lesion anymore.	2.031904217683391
The patients showed a typical "sunken pattern" at the trepanation site.	2.254818138856372
All patients developed clinical signs of transtentorial herniation (i.e.	2.2359805283849834
unilateral dilated pupils, deteriorated alertness, and extensor posturing) shortly after either diagnostic or presumed therapeutic lumbar puncture.	1.8145151440579026
One patient developed herniation a second time while in the typical 30 ° upright position.	2.0874507808793172
After craniectomy, transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased ICP.	2.4901092436420287
It is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure, which is enhanced by changes in the CSF compartment following lumbar puncture.	2.3677269050707217
Lumbar puncture should be avoided if possible and, when necessary, only be performed in the head-down position.	2.870552281744212
Acute therapy in these cases is quite simple; it requires flat or even head-down positioning and early cranioplasty.	2.085326302075065
Diseases of the oral cavity, floor of the mouth, and nervous system can be accompanied by disturbances in tongue movement during swallowing.	2.072904122851945
These disturbances can be diagnosed by videosonography whereby the examiner has to evaluate extensive video documentation of lingual motion.	2.092424148357216
It was the aim of this study to facilitate this evaluation by the application of a reproducible computer-assisted quantitative analysis procedure.	2.4024865803680657
Video sequences of 56 healthy adults and 19 patients with dysphagias of different etiologies were analysed.	2.2009937386574263
A numerical estimation of swallowing movements was carried out in abstraction from the structures imaged (bolus, air, muscles of the tongue, floor of the mouth, hyoid, etc.).	1.8950891760007578
Intensity changes of the pixels within previously defined radial image sectors were quantified in relationship to time and depicted as sector curves.	1.9508405369621038
The healthy adults demonstrated a characteristic pattern of two motion maxima that appeared within almost all sector curves.	1.9098781289645552
These maxima represented bolus transport movements and the reset movement of the tongue.	2.195470754175667
Patients with diseases of the tongue or neuromuscular changes caused by disturbances of the central nervous system showed pathological deviations on videosonography.	2.338785565927166
These appeared as local or general reductions in movement, slow speed motions, repetitive swallowing or unsorted additional movements of the tongue during swallowing.	1.893010385303169
Previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of S-(+)-ketamine to be three times higher than that of R-(-)-ketamine.	2.131934622669008
It was the aim of this study to compare the effects of S-(+)-ketamine and racemic ketamine on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, recovery, and side effects in geriatric patients during total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) for orthopaedic surgery.	2.128034518799219
Forty patients over 60 years of age scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement were investigated in a double-blind, randomised design.	2.3008624331421657
For induction of TIVA, patients received 0.1 mg midazolam, 0.5 mg atropine, 1 mg/kg S(+)-ketamine or 2 mg/kg racemic ketamine, respectively, 2 mg vecuronium, and 1.5 mg/kg suxamethonium.	2.2842420021289467
After intubation and relaxation with a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg per hour S-(+)- or 4 mg/kg per hour racemic ketamine was administered throughout surgery.	2.282277523203914
Blood samples were taken through a central venous catheter at seven time-points, before induction as well during and after surgery, until the 1st postoperative morning for analysis of adrenaline, noradrenaline (by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection), anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (by radioimmunoassay), glucose, and lactate.	1.8122487830397684
In addition, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation were measured, and the time intervals between the end of ketamine infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were protocolled.	2.3469253171145588
The incidence and assessment of dreams and other side effects were reported by the patients.	2.5107095638725294
Biometric data of the groups were comparable, the mean age of both groups being 68 years.	2.6288825354337946
Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, ADH, ACTH, cortisol, and glucose as well as SAP and HR increased significantly (P<0.05) during the course of anaesthesia.	2.438350991651316
The influence on lactate levels was not significant.	2.3880321039428862
There were no differences between S-(+)- and racemic ketamine with respect to these parameters.	2.429531813339458
Three patients in the ketamine-racemate group showed severe arterial hypertension and were withdrawn from the study.	2.2478129788185464
Recovery clearly improved after administration of S-(+)-ketamine compared to the racemate.	2.63402309052235
Simple orders were followed after 2.0 +/- 3.4 versus 4.9 +/- 6.8 min (P=0.07), orientation with respect to person returned after 5.7 +/- 4.0 versus 14.6 +/- 10.0 min (P<0.001) and spatial orientation after 8.2 +/- 5.4 versus 17.4 +/- 9.7 min (P<0.001).	1.8690870188843498
After racemic ketamine, 1 patient remembered a negative dream and 1 patient a positive dream.	2.177324067924623
In the S-(+)-group, 1 positive dream was reported.	2.3242479868165633
No intraoperative awareness was reported, and all patients would accept the same anaesthesia again.	2.1708252033832998
Increases in cardiovascular parameters and insufficient reduction of the stress response with respect to ADH, ACTH, and cortisol seem to require a more potent hypnotic element during TIVA with ketamine.	2.0776178870141777
With regard to endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, the pharmacodynamic effects of racemic and S-(+)-ketamine were comparable.	2.0361479939545046
Because of the significant improvement in recovery and the reduced quantitative drug load, S-(+)-ketamine offers a clinical advantage compared with currently used racemic ketamine.	2.000780752490296
The closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying, if a free transplant is necessary.	1.9643520778922392
Following the technique of Tillmann described first in 1908, several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined.	1.9961780684255785
We report on 14 patients (ages 41-88 years) where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors (5 melanomas, 5 basal cell carcinomas, 1 keratoacanthoma, 1 trichilemmal cyst, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 skin metastasis) were successfully closed by this method.	1.8827785968896238
The diameter of the defect ranged between 4 and 8 cm (mean 5,7 cm).	2.360602570748657
Size and number of the rotating flaps (3 or 4) was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue.	2.467607497296127
The procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases.	2.7159915234646737
Wound healing occurred without complications except in 3 cases.	2.4248068966501406
2 patients (63 years, 70 years) developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps.	2.0040844258753903
In a 74 year old man with a very large defect of 8 cm diameter, one flap of four underwent total necrosis.	2.0698290435512816
The cosmetic result was rated "very good" in 71,4% and "good" in 14,3%.	2.204564809615123
The preservation of the terminal hair turned out to be of special advantage.	2.4713368446156143
The "windmill procedure" is an important addition to the surgical approaches for closure of large defects on the scalp, particularly in young patients.	2.5447913074062236
Intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery is an extremely rare type of malignant tumor of the large vessels.	2.557497319633354
Despite systematic diagnostics, distinguishing between pulmonary emboli and tumors is difficult.	2.120792863080853
We report a patient who was referred because of suspected embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery.	2.449555502954396
The operation was started with the intention of performing a pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy; however, intraoperative histology revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor.	1.9593210796647713
Therefore, the left lung was resected with the use of extracorporeal circulation, and the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery were reconstructed.	2.778995407441713
A solitary right lung metastasis was resected 3 months later using stapling devices.	2.0590902472992023
Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with sarcoma of the pulmonary arteries.	3.0493588961592812
Surgical therapy often includes extensive reconstructive measures.	2.235253956374807
Since, thromboembolic obstruction cannot be excluded preoperatively, patients with this type of disease should be treated at centers experienced with the broad spectrum of pulmonary artery surgery.	2.436431344253653
Abstract  A rare cause of painful swelling of the knee cavity can be an aneurysm of the popliteal vein.	2.7605870742971432
Only 28 cases are reported in the literature.	2.4403058457591076
We treated a 20-year-old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies, one operation and one MRI; finally, phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins.	1.9638084604970103
To avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed.	2.351906644456644
Twelve months after the operation the patient is free of symptoms with a patent autograft.	2.840340346449823
Hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages: (1) stigmatization of the patient; (2) the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion; (3) in many patients, the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect; (4) acoustic feedback when amplification is high.	2.4438703548391443
Conventional hearing aids transmit sound into the ear canal via a small microphone.	2.207283786357812
Sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission.	2.1288613860581207
This along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned.	2.270525532287493
In contrast, implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations.	2.000874471432851
An implantable hearing aid has an electromechanical transducer instead of the loudspeaker of a conventional hearing aid.	2.207171225489776
The hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system bypassing the air.	1.8539750733777811
This implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane, the ossicular chain, the perilymph of the inner ear, or the skull.	2.321541408165193
Corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines.	2.408271273164202
As the corneal endothelium may be exposed to endotoxin in organ culture and endotoxin is known to trigger inflammatory reactions, we investigated the effect of endotoxin from E. coli on organ cultured donor corneae with respect to autocrine and paracrine functions and the endothelial viability and density.	1.939853327765575
For the majority of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) many available hearing aids often do not achieve satisfactory results.	2.2005002374551057
For these patients partially implantable hearing devices have been developed, allowing distortion-free hearing and speech intelligibility that may be superior to conventional hearing aids.	2.1367613542394572
The external parts of partial implants, however, may result in a patient's stigmatization.	2.6576687298647315
Furthermore, they do not use the acoustic properties of the external auditory canal.	2.5084042423943593
Recently, we published the successful development of the first totally implantable hearing device for the treatment of SNHL (HNO 46 [1998] 853-863).	2.324384374593492
Here we report the first implantations of this unique, totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients with SNHL: Implex TICA LZ 3001.	2.1588039429472445
The implant microphone is implanted subcutaneously in the outer ear canal near the ear drum.	1.9960980154950918
The signal is processed by a digitally programmable multichannel audioprocessor located subcutaneously on the bony skull behind the ear.	1.8245289007993548
A piezoelectric transducer is coupled to the body of the incus and drives the ossicular chain by vibratory actions.	2.11303075257741
Energy is provided by an implantable battery.	2.595633471890169
Implanted patients describe hearing as being distortion-free and transparent.	2.281776770714217
Speech intelligibility and the hearing of music are improved.	2.238916371821653
Patients may achieve better speech discrimination, especially in the presence of background noise.	2.7268860951495175
The aid can be used during sports, including swimming.	2.746424837488221
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the implantation of a totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients.	2.0415555679944384
These results encourage further implantations of the totally implantable hearing system in the course of an ongoing clinical study.	2.3670273828568473
Catheter ablation by means of radiofrequency energy (RF) is an established method in the treatment of various forms of supraventricular and atrioventricular tachycardias.	2.7742849634152975
In patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), the success of catheter ablation depends on the pathophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmia and on the underlying heart disease.	2.747360565510442
In the following report we give a definition of the terms nomenclature and classification.	2.2138273349703157
We find out, that the two terms are very similar.	2.6613728337648785
They include the keys for diagnosis and therapy.	2.5902181397624884
We propose a method to construct new coding-systems.	2.1373499386062025
Furthermore we report about the existing coding-systems in Orthopaedics and Traumatology.	2.2829411443267897
We cite a list of national and international coding-systems.	2.2881767072134553
Because of the actuality we finally give a definition of the term "Indikationsspezifische Komplikation", which is of importance since the "5.	2.292823163200199
Änderungsverordnung" of the "BPFLV-95" within the classification of the "Fallpauschalen".	2.335672933523987
"Fallpauschalen" are a system like the American DRG's (Diagnosis related groups), but not exacly the same.	2.247556946467672
Resection of a stenosing colon tumor in an 89-year-old male patient led to the diagnosis, unusual at this age, of an inflammatory pseudotumor (synonym: plasma cell granuloma) of the retroperitoneum and mesentery, which invaded the large bowel and showed infiltration of one regional lymph node.	2.05244689068725
The etiology and exact nosological classification of inflammatory pseudotumors are not yet unequivocally settled.	2.1184292666614244
The recently published conjecture that such lesions of the retroperitoneum represent a separate entity with features of a malignant neoplasm is discussed.	2.1983912093107536
An example of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour (PFT) is presented for the first time in the German-language literature.	2.320599022275459
The diagnostic criteria for this rare soft-tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood, which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur, include the plexiform structure which gives it its name, extensive siderin deposits and numerous osteoclast-like giant cells.	1.9167947908406975
The development of the tumour described here, which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant haemangiopericytoma excised 7 years previously, indicates the possibility of induction of PFT by radiation.	2.46248549699087
The current increase in the cost of health care must be considered as a severe threat to the prehospital emergency services system.	2.4614252144560016
Two examples have been selected - the patient with polytrauma and the patient in cardiac arrest - to demonstrate the dilemma between a need for objective data and the requirements of emergency patients.	2.4307801870699803
Study results obtained in trauma patients indicating that total prehospital time, including scene time, is correlated to patient outcome have led to the conclusion that at the scene treatment by emergency physicians may be dispensable.	2.2167681845969014
It has, however also been demonstrated that the time required for medical treatment at the scene is equivalent to 20% of the total scene time, thus representing only a fraction of the total prehospital time.	2.3387520400189428
Correlating the total prehospital time or scene time to outcome therefore appears absurd.	2.124076162587162
The treatment principle of aggressive shock treatment in polytrauma needs critical reevaluation on the basis of results obtained by recent preclinical studies in patients with penetrating torso injuries.	2.3068373664616826
Small volume resuscitation could not be demonstrated to improve outcome in polytrauma patients, although a slight improvement in patients with brain injury may be assumed.	2.5501767166734033
Endotracheal intubation and early artificial ventilation are proven therapeutic principles in polytraumatized patients.	2.0472406395174945
Unfortunately, for ethical reasons randomised carefully controlled comparative studies can not be performed in polytrauma patients unless the patient is fully conscious.	2.3044375187029504
The importance of endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation in unconscious trauma patients becomes apparent under conditions of anaesthesia where the application of the endotracheal tube averts regurgitation, aspiration and concomitant morbidity and mortality.	2.0457645125303396
The common causes of cardiovascular collapse and their pathomechanisms, as well as the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, have been widely investigated.	2.481800074423494
Nevertheless, various aspects of their application are still controversial.	2.2502476841968058
The most recent study results have recommended initial ventilation prior to thoracic compression.	1.9819923907700892
New methods of assisting mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation, such as ACD CPR or vest CPR, have shown promising results in animal experiments.	2.088278499857001
However, the importance of results obtained by preclinical randomised controlled investigations in humans need to be confirmed by further studies as to outcome.	2.3483461743285985
The efficacy of defibrillation in cases of ventricular fibrillation has been clearly demonstrated, particularly with a view to the interval between ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation.	2.375466443409093
It has further been demonstrated that basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves ventricular fibrillation and thus improves the chance of survival.	2.0729265505657626
The present generation of defibrillators has been further improved, particularly by the introduction of biphasic defibrillator wave forms, which may reduce the required energy, as well as possible complications, while offering an increase in the efficacy of defibrillation and a reduction in defibrillator size.	2.4141373145492993
Scientific emergency medicine is responsible not only for the development and validation of new methods and concepts, but in particular for their application under quality control conditions.	2.231128675244876
Politicians require an improvement in the quality of the validation of emergency measures, although the instruments available for the investigation of these measures are known to be obsolete (experimental models, experimental design).	2.371552953301363
Additionally, the financial support of research in emergency medicine suffers from being accourded low priority by public research funds such as the German Research Fund.	1.9654030137710532
However, in view of the rapid application of experimental results to daily practice it should be emphasized that patients also support research in emergency medicine via their direct financial contributions to the health insurance companies.	2.023105390686444
The prognosis in patients with gynecologic cancers depends not only on the stage but also on a wide spectrum of other findings.	2.4891374457941917
Cross-sectional imaging modalities, including sonography, CT and MRI, have increasingly been used for optimal treatment planning in gynecologic cancers.	2.195704586276352
Their staging criteria are based on the well-established FIGO staging system.	2.944626149563355
CT and MRI compete with sonography, which plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the female pelvis.	2.717493228324079
This paper reviews the role of sonography, CT and MRI in the staging of gynecologic malignancies.	2.464834381344046
It puts the emphasis on MRI, which has been established as imaging modality of choice in the preoperative evaluation of cervical and endometrial cancer, and which seems slightly superior to CT in the staging of ovarian cancer.	2.218235420161796
Extraabdominal desmoids represent one group of deep fibromatoses.	2.3268119978487696
These aggressive nonmetastasizing tumorlike lesions have a strong tendency to local infiltration, with a recurrence rate of about 40 %.	2.284050881796524
Trauma, hormones and heredity have been implicated as etiologic factors.	2.0916217265775647
Shoulder, chest wall, back and thigh are favored sites.	2.1153622343988037
While in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy, nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation, hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important.	2.1899388122779526
Amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly.	2.3671788138079375
Katayama syndrome is an allergic reaction of antigens of schistosomes, known as the acute phase of schistosomiasis.	2.252308975340861
We report on an eleven year-old boy, who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to Malawi.	2.1225798631617816
Remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma-antigens.	2.169727400405776
Parasitological examinations of urine and faeces four months later were negative.	2.1447784949699327
There is still a significant lack of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for chronic pain patients in Germany today.	2.5703546699134563
Most of all the treatment of low back pain and widespread pain syndromes or panalgesia is time consuming and complicated.	2.5945777358659186
The main problem of anaesthesiological pain clinics is the increase of these complex pain syndromes in the last years.	2.413087644220611
The definition of chronic pain is a contiuous noxious input modulated and compounded by the prolonged or recurrent nature of chronic state and further complicated by a multitude of economic and psychosocial factors.	1.9118562202525815
It is now clear that no one discipline or mode will suffice.	1.9768396471616603
Only a multidisciplinary and intensive approache will prevail, as discussed in this article.	2.077693155694775
Unfortunately these multidisciplinary pain units are nearly not existing in Gemany just as little as control of the effectiveness of pain treatment.	2.144324081935412
The use of somato-sensory evoked potentials (SEP) in supraaortal reconstructions has been well accepted.	1.9717456342274702
However, reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic SEP alterations differ widely.	2.1079488921050746
In a prospective study we registered SEP alterations during 482 operations done on 419 patients between 1 July 1994, and 31 December 1996.	1.9062043404029807
Incidence, risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated.	2.6791822848548814
In only 1.7% of cases SEP examination was inadequate.	2.1703926777458995
During 406 operations SEP were altered minimally or not at all.	2.0191704433547013
Significant changes were dedected during 65 interventions (13.5%).	2.091656336516906
The clinical outcome was poor when alteration was found during carotid dissection (five events, three deficits).	1.9164902324041564
Cross-clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations (81.5%); they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance.	1.9151627353289475
As risk factor for cross-clamping ischaemia, only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified.	2.286000535038621
Tyrosine-rich crystalloids in tumors of the salivary glands are rare and have been reported mainly in specimens from Black African patients.	2.360633743547756
The pathogenesis of these structures is still unclear, but pathological secretion by neoplastic myoepithelial cells is supposed.	2.106998043112448
Millon's staining and ultrastructural examinations are used for confirming the diagnosis.	2.3070790951218245
We present the case report of a 59-year-old woman with a myoepithelioma of the minor salivary glands in the smooth palate containing tyrosine-rich crystalloids as an example of this rare phenomenon.	2.0399272980762513
Pseudoarthrosis and cubitus valgus as main complications following displaced fractures of the radial condyle in children can be prevented by open reduction and fixation by K wires.	2.1744335995839474
However, delayed union and stimulation of the radial physis with condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow as well as fishtail deformities of the distal end of the humerus are reported nevertheless.	2.5376928157609573
To prevent those growth disturbances all primary and secondary (4-day X-ray control) displaced fractures of the radial condyle, i. e. those with a central gap of more than 2 mm, were prospectively treated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw beginning 1974.	2.236665680835434
Sixty-six patients (41 boys, 25 girls) with an average follow-up of 10 years (2-22 years) sustained 28 primary and 6 secondary displaced fractures.	2.314605040366152
In 5 cases a K wire fixation was performed in view of the smallness of the fragment.	2.462194309524137
Two children with conservative treatment following overlooked displaced fractures showed condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow.	1.9830804557860806
Screw osteosynthesis led to symmetric elbow angles and function in all cases, whereas fishtail deformities could be observed in 8 of 27 children, probably as a consequence of the remaining central fracture instability.	2.285648343929229
Conclusion: Open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw prevents condylar overgrowth in displaced fractures of the radial condyle by guaranteeing fracture healing in anatomic position within 3-4 weeks.	2.0248600977563096
However, fishtail deformity can not be prevented by metaphyseal compression only.	2.2952864515780305
Both patients were receiving tranexamic acid or danazol therapy as oral long-term prophylaxis.	2.1585371695969418
Over the years the patients underwent several operations in regional and general anaesthesia, with mask ventilation or intubation.	2.123967393074389
The C1-INH plasma concentrations measured preoperatively were always very low (0.02-0.06 g/l, normal range 0.15-0.35 g/l), despite the oral long-term prophylaxis.	2.0880072306920665
Substitution treatment with 500-1000 U C1-INH was performed 1 h before surgery.	2.125425470026641
No side effects were seen following the concentrate infusions.	2.368903554098303
With this substitution treatment no specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic oedema were recognized in either case.	1.9543904010901523
The measurement of C1-INH plasma concentration 2 h or 4 h after C1-INH substitution showed a marked rise in both patients, though normal values were not reached in either.	1.9604017463031673
We suggest that infusion of C1 concentrate is an appropriate form of preoperative substitution treatment in patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema, in view of the lower risk of infection than with infusion of fresh-frozen plasma and the observed effectiveness.	2.255840577478847
This case report describes a 62 years old patient who suffered from therapy resisten atrial fibrillation for 12 years.	2.338901163393608
She underwent "Cox/Maze-III-Procedure" during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved.	2.0824838266443133
Two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm.	2.379557070604936
Transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility.	2.0346168158216607
Therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics could be discontinued.	2.224982679176764
Two cases of congenital wandering spleen with typical clinical course are reported:  An 11-year old girl had a two month history of intermittent abdominal pain predominantly after physical stress.	2.018812526262053
In upright position a palpable resistance could be identified as wandering spleen by ultrasound and scintiscan, and in this case splenopexy was performed.	2.2822580223635995
An otherwise healthy 3-year old girl suffered from acute abdomen caused by torsion of an upside- down spleen with partial infarction.	2.1934821851531194
Diagnosis was made based on ultrasound and CT-Scan.	2.2670916548209195
The extent of infarction could be evaluated by color flow sonography.	2.279207579967705
After partial resection splenopexy in orthotopic position was performed.	2.171076371188586
Discussion: In situations of intermittent abdominal pain as well as acute abdomen torsion of wandering spleen should be taken into consideration.	2.30783883533232
Monodisciplinary orthopaedic pain therapy no longer measures up to international standards.	2.1520374491171186
In cases of chronic back pain, in particular, there is such a gulf between the clinical findings and the patient's subjective assessment that the symptoms cannot be attributed solely to so-called degenerative changes.	2.4666220296764765
Back pain patients are in great danger of becoming fixated on somatic symptoms due to an excess of diagnostic procedures or incorrect diagnoses, of being treated purely somatically on the basis of associated findings, and of suffering irreversible damage from invasive management of such findings.	2.000491549955402
Despite the wealth of empirical evidence, it remains difficult to expand the everyday concept of illness and its causes to include not only physical and biological factors but also social and emotional disturbances.	1.8754252385889816
The decision to undertake invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures then frequently represents the doctor's reaction to feelings of irritation or helplessness.	1.8286859878521426
If this situation is to change, an interdisciplinary concept of pain must be made a part of medical training, and scientific findings must be presented in such a way that they can be integrated into routine daily practice.	1.9970868616756068
The laboratory surveillance of measles in Germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation.	2.168172699766022
Compared to data of the pre-vaccination era, the incidence of measles has been reduced, while a shift in age towards the group of 15-year-olds is observed.	2.546447872340846
Germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of eradicating measles in the European region by the year 2007.	2.133328695905214
Apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking, the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot.	1.990753975080785
In order to effectively control measles, high vaccination rates of at least 90% are necessary by the end of the second year of life.	2.213053221014116
Main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases, seroprevalence studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses.	2.3223812781378133
The Working Group Measles ("Arbeitsgemeinschaft Masern" - AGM) as well as the amended law on infection prevention are important instruments to make measurable progress towards measles eradication also in Germany.	1.8707456133380977
We report on the activities of the National Reference Centre for Measles, Mumps and Rubella since 1991.	1.8570139343605763
The German data are compared to those of selected other European countries.	2.344117801796148
The different methods that are available for the assessment and quantification of "brittle nails" and for the evaluation of various therapeutical approaches are compared.	2.6440322885463066
At this time, measurement of the swelling properties is the best documented and most reliable method for studying the treatment of brittle nails.	2.4852994237129877
Reliable qualitative data can also be obtained by scanning electron microscopy.	2.575154677718985
Measurement of the transonychial water loss and assessment of thickness and density of nails by ultrasound have also been used successfully, but the methodology still has to be improved and the reproducibility, confirmed.	2.21721657286446
The case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described.	2.3750041384672342
This combination of injuries is rather rare and only 25 cases were found in the literature.	2.5010614457696225
The sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable, probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule.	2.3422237193074498
Immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result.	2.1202897136081567
The management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently.	2.4096335862646767
Surgeons' education, preclinical rescue structures, initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies, as well as diagnostic imaging, have progressed.	2.347038331290887
Plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of CT. Fast imaging techniques (spiral CT) have led to the inclusion of CT in the primary survey.	2.3034707094583338
To minimize the risk to the patient during prolonged diagnostic time, algorithms have to be defined concerning structures, emergency room equipment and quality.	2.2277922764402995
Basics, state of the art and suggestions concerning management of multiple trauma patients are presented and discussed from the radiologist's point of view.	2.1594003330734117
The importance of hepatitis C virus infection has been recently noted in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy.	2.4430305528837337
In a collaborative research project of the Committees for the Study of Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy, hepatitis C virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients (10.65) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in 42 of 663 patients (6.3%) with dilated cardiomyopathy; these prevalences were significantly higher than that found in volunteer blood donors in Japan.	1.8610778583890935
Hepatitis C virus antibody was detected in 650 of 11,967 patients (5.4%) seeking care in 5 academic hospitals.	1.958130567091854
Various cardiac abnormalities were found, and arrhythmias were the most frequent.	2.8340146119157206
These observations suggest that hepatitis C virus infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases.	2.46579564789993
Transdifferentiated retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) display enhanced contractile potentials and have been implicated in the development of tractional retinal detachment.	2.224401553257062
This study determines the activity of contraction-promoting factors, examines some involved mechanisms and evaluates inhibitors.	1.9434743145646662
Using an in vitro contractionassay, we demonstrated that collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells is effectively stimulated by serum, platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1.	1.9275960486492663
Endothelin-1 and transforming growth factor-1 and -2 have a more discrete or marginal effect.	2.4339720254316215
Tractional forces promoted by these peptides are completely protein synthesis dependent.	2.0799213667171155
Contraction stimulated by serum is only partly dependent on de novo protein synthesis, suggesting different active factors and/or pathways.	2.1513477935121292
Staurosporine, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, effectively inhibited collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells regardless of the promoter.	1.9024050139592705
Revascularization in cases of recurrent occlusions following aorto-iliac vascular reconstructions, particular in high-risk patients, poses a therapeutic dilemma.	2.2424084932707156
We report the case of a 78-year-old female patient who presented - after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries - with Leriche syndrome, resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease.	1.8851194364760655
Due to the high surgical and anesthetic risk we implanted an axillo-bifemoral PTFE graft.	1.9234419030115018
The preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high-grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid-subclavian bypass on the left.	2.5150335290320043
This stenosis was dilated and then stented by way of the proximal end of the axillo-bifemoral graft, which in turn was distally anastomosed to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery.	2.104015944261093
Postoperative angiography verified a good run-off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained.	2.079206013427606
Duplex sonography 6 months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms.	2.8076879352303976
These results demonstrate that, combined with intraoperative stent application, an axillo-bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results.	2.191518367593362
Objective: Concerning the long-term somatic development of children born with very low birth weight and/or born very premature, there are varying and sometimes contradictory statements.	2.359068156477466
A follow-up study was carried out on premature-born children from Thuringia and Saxonia at pre-school and early school age in order to investigate the long-term somatic development of these children.	2.4126968202520063
Anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group.	2.809414431079038
Mediastinitis caused by infection with Clostridium perfringens and spontaneous rupture of the esophagus are both life threatening conditions.	2.279267141194668
The combination of these two entities led to septic multiorgan failure in a 38-year-old woman.	2.2741493090911185
The patient was treated successfully by esophagectomy and postoperative lavage through a partially open abdomen.	2.002474978787455
The lack of information regarding emesis, the leading symptom of Boerhaave's syndrome, caused delayed diagnosis: the triad of emesis, severe epigastric pain and emphysema of the skin was not established until 30 h after the onset of symptoms.	1.9797555811403105
For ethical and socio-economical reasons (cost-explosion in transfusion-medicine, patient's individual destiny), devepolment and consistent application of allogeneic transfusion sparing techniques in surgery is a chal- lenge to anesthesiologists, surgeons and blood-bankers.	1.7131073677822806
The combination of different techniques, i.e.	2.3344926131010646
autologous predonation, hemodilution, choice of anesthetic regimen, deliberate hypotension, application of anti-fibrinolytic agents and autotransfusion of intraoperatively saved blood allow for avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion even in patients presenting important intraoperative hemorrhage.	1.8272960006624683
Different procedures are recommended: reinsertion of the superior oblique in the right place, recession of the inferior oblique muscle, and operations on the vertical muscles of the same or the yoke eye.	2.152138743438552
No quantitative recommendations on the surgical amount are mentioned in the literature.	2.1475019301135583
In 180 children (87 children belonging to a control group, 68 with fever of non-renal origin, and 25 with pyelonephritis) albumin and immunoglobulin G (markers for glomerular dysfunction), -1-microglobulin and  -NAG (markers for proximal tubular dysfunction) and apolipoprotein A1 (marker of 'postrenal' dysfunction) were measured in second-voided morning urine.	1.8452346912455622
In children with fever of non-renal origin, glomerular dysfunction was encountered in 8.8 %, tubular dysfunction in 17.6 % and mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction in 14.7 % of cases.	1.826404472234473
Among children with pyelonephritis, 28 % revealed glomerular dysfunction and 44 % mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction.	1.9956208224810617
No case of solitary proximal tubular dysfunction was observed in children with pyelonephritis.	2.918561160722159
There were highly significant differences in presence and expression of glomerular dysfunction between children with fever of non-renal origin and children with pyelonephritis (P < 0.0001), whereas with regard to proximal tubular dysfunction, the differences were only moderately significant ( -NAG: P < 0.01) or of low significance (-1-microglobulin: P < 0.05).	2.140170582536858
Up to the middle of the 1970s, chemotherapy had only a marginal role in the overall treatment concept for cervical carcinoma, and surgery and radiotherapy are still the cornerstones of treatment today.	2.140893364485255
There are indications for chemotherapy, which can theoretically be used as follows:	2.840549222031937
In all patients, CO2 laser treatment showed a better cosmetic result whereas erythema and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation were less marked in Er:YAG laser therapy.	1.7862858895088392
A separation of the individual latex layers is a known complication of endotracheal armoured tubes manufactured by immersion technique.	2.1102876147793532
This can result in herniation into the lumen with obstruction of the tube.	2.387399373439309
Diffusion of nitrous oxide into the inner hernia considerably intensifies the obstruction.	2.029950293778026
This can lead to life-threatening situations.	2.9142296908237513
We observed a similar herniation caused by layer separation with subsequent tube obstruction of silicolatex anaesthesia tubes used in paediatric circuit systems.	1.7924317438199409
This is caused by manufacturing defects and above all by damage incurred in reprocessing.	2.1210762329994273
Therefore it is important to process the tubes carefully.	2.340154989036366
A too-high drying temperature can cause premature layer separation.	2.0610391822687695
The tubes should never be processed more than 80 times.	2.291571647489122
Routine examination of the tubes is imperative, especially at the predilection sites for layer separation.	2.2428253800429223
Severe aortic valve disease is a rare complication of coarctation in adults.	2.9793107421179297
Between 1961 and 1990 aortic valve replacement was performed after or combined with the operation of coarctation in 24 adults (4% of entire population operated for coarctation).	2.055575526094395
Bicuspid aortic valves were present in 2/3 of patients.	2.553707300030373
In 10 patients (710 with aortic stenosis) coarctation was operated early (mean age 24 years) and aortic valve late (mean age 40 years): in 14 (1014 with aortic regurgitation, mean age 40 years) aortic valve and coarctation were operated simultaneously (8 patients) or staged within 6 months (6 patients).	2.0651178597580198
Additional surgical interventions on the dilated aorta ascendens were performed in 8, mitral valve replacement in 2 and aorto-coronary bypass in 1 patients.	2.046717347284745
Abstract  13 experienced addiction therapists provid-ed information about trauma experiences and comorbidity of 122 clients (26 women and 96 men) with opiate addiction and multiple substance abuse.	1.7358975603479232
42% had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men.	2.2216787569471026
The victimization primarely took place during childhood and prior to the begin of drug consumption.	2.1796483800757644
26% of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder.	2.505466806196979
In comparison with individuals without trauma experiences, victims evidenced significantly more comorbid symptoms, they more frequently suffered from polytoxicomania and had more experiences with psychotherapy.	1.8040920984494662
Nearly all drugs currently used during the course of general anaesthesia may lead to hypersensitivity reactions of various types.	2.625226623835205
There may be an acute type I allergic reactions or to a more or less severe pseudoallergic reactions, in rare cases with lethal outcome.	2.1567611438902587
Routine preoperative testing appears of little predictive value, in spite of the high frequency of so-called risk factors (atopy, other kind of allergy) among the evaluated group of patients.	2.1451912655798697
Careful allergological testing should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after any incidents of suspected drug intolerance, in order to discover the underlying causative agent.	2.304579770957884
Skin testing is of diagnostic value for neuromuscular blockers and intravenous narcotics.	2.22732558703172
RAST- and RIA-tests and/or mediator releasing tests may also used additionally.	2.3154461025623356
Together with all other administered drugs, all the routinely used neuromuscular blockers (suxamethonium, vecuronium, pancuronium, alcuronium, atracurium, mivacurium) should be tested, since they often represent the cause for such reactions.	1.846146711412141
For other classes of drugs (for example, volatile anesthetics and opioids) the clinical relevance of skin testing still remains uncertain.	2.108632469570794
For less severe incidents seen during general anaesthesia such as pruritus, or exanthems, skin testing seems to be less relevant.	2.1025064410096306
Nociception is a protective system of the body which prevents it from injury and tissue damage.	2.3365636722382424
Human beings respond to noxious stimuli by moving away.	2.226749443645454
They learn by pain to avoid these situations in future.	2.250335511139685
Shortly after major injury, there is a limited analgesic period allowing the body to flee the area of danger, later on, emerging pain compels the body to rest and supports recuperation.	2.086005000291046
While acute pain has a certain meaning, chronic pain does not.	2.245652709577435
It induces a comprehensive suffering including loss of initiative, appetite and vigilance.	1.9835656498705316
It reduces life-quality, often accompanied by depressive moods.	2.2624158147539704
Acute pain causes changes in the central nervous system leading to an increased sensitivity of nociception (hyperalgesia).	2.49619967607396
During healing, the central processing of noxious stimuli is normalised taking minutes to weeks.	2.0577300260706477
Sometimes, unknown factors initiate chronification of pain.	2.1805665248712547
Changes on a molecular level in peripheral tissue as well as in the central nervous system induce "cellular early genes" [24], a synthesis of c-fos, c-jun and other proteins favouring the chronification of pain.	2.0132035180911947
All efforts have to be made to depress or interrupt such a development.	2.462986207048501
One of the first steps to pain prophylaxis in a hospital is an optimal surgical technique: incision, extension, limited tissue damage and minimal invasive surgery should guarantee the smallest impairment of the nociceptive system possible.	1.9854333917338813
However, nociceptive input is intense and of long duration and leads to central sensibilisation.	2.093034036813231
Postoperative pain has lost its function as surgery anticipates healing.	2.166457363773754
Pain induces a reduction of ventilation, circulation, digestion and increases the risk of other disorders.	2.5308043803677656
There is need of aggressive pain treatment for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of late sequelae like permanent pain and increased reduction of function [10].	1.9176468032027019
This is of pivotal importance in patients with amputations or sympathetic reflex dystrophy (SRD).	2.3284431225723985
Antinociception is best provided by regional anaesthesia technique with a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids which results in better outcome [2, 12].	2.2100330995469695
Hence, regional anaesthesia techniques are strongly indicated in those patients.	2.3469506106339875
Good antinociception may be even more important than it is assumed today.	2.203181656946069
Anand [1] demonstrated a lower morbidity and mortality in 45 newborns undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, when general anaesthesia was performed with high-dose sufentanil versus halothane supplementary doses of morphine.	2.2568357179608785
Anaesthesiologists have to reconsider the quality of general anaesthesia: the antinociception of their regimen.	2.4856526981777756
In diagnostics of erectile dysfunction there are different simple or large-scale procedures available.	2.08533752395353
Refering to a three-step-scheme that makes difference in the diagnostics in I. non-invasive, II.	2.301087057126992
invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained.	2.508207767431635
To the non-invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics, the physical examination and laboratory screenings.	2.118843171936743
The third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological cavernosography and cavernosometry (DICC) and the selective pharmacological phallo-arteriography.	1.9406734178821021
The procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions.	2.1195920920743916
Technological advances in the last two years in mammalian nuclear transfer techniques and the establishment of human embryonic stem cell lines formed the background of the International Workshop on "Embryonic Stem Cells and Nuclear Transfer Strategies" organized at the Gene Center, Munich, September 1999.	1.933775595071756
The aim of the meeting was to bring together scientists working in the stem cell field and those working on somatic nuclear transfer techniques to discuss the present status and prospects of both technologies for basic and applied research and future use in medicine and livestock breeding.	1.7356256248936732
"Biology of Embryonic Stem Cells", "Nuclear Transfer Strategies", and "Stem Cell Differentiation - Cell Therapy" were the main topics of the meeting.	1.8546328197329758
It became clear that we are far from understanding the processes involved in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and the mechanisms resulting in reprogramming of nuclei from somatic cells after transfer into enucleated oocytes.	1.74381640979036
However, data were presented that showed the enormous potential of the embryonic stem cell technology for tissue transplantation in the future.	2.0476367105701287
Before any use of this technology in combination with any cloning technology for human cell therapy will be possible, further research including animal models and stem cell differentiation approaches in culture (i. e., identification of differentiation factors, selective differentiation strategies, reporter gene assays) is necessary to understand the basic principles of pluripotent stem cell differentiation and the mechanisms involved in reprogramming somatic cell nuclei.	1.9625643936832127
Certain fractures and/or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post-traumatic osteonecrosis.	2.7337272001048687
Intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation, and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent hypofibrinolysis.	1.8720819818001009
The aim of our study was to investigate the influence that serum of patients with preeclampsia has on t-PA and PAI-1 expression from human endothelial cells.	2.05344738692099
For this purpose, we cultured human endothelium cells, gained from umbilical veins, for 24 h with sera of 7 patients with HELLP syndrome and 12 patients with preeclampsia.	2.0522011864818563
The sera of 12 normotensive pregnant patients and 9 non-pregnant women were used as controls.	2.0793519010010075
We then determined t-PA and PAI-1 levels by ELISA, both in the maternal serum and in the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures.	2.0822755359222618
While t-PA levels were significantly higher in the serum of patients with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome than in the control group (median: 8.0 ng/ml and 6.2 ng/ml vs 3.9 ng/ml and 3.1 ng/ml), levels of PAI-1 did not show any significant disparity among the different groups.	2.354232830430899
The supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures demonstrated significantly elevated levels of both t-PA (P<0.001) and PAI-1 (P<0.01) when stimulated with serum gained from patients with preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome.	2.163362276078394
The increased expression of t-PA and PAI-1 from human endothelium cells after stimulation with the serum of preeclamptic patients must be considered as a sign of increased endothelial cell activation.	2.079766723429005
Postoperative pain relief can be achieved by several methods, including the use of systemic opioids and regional anaesthesia with intrathecal or epidural opioids or local anaesthetics.	2.3918390118758386
On-demand analgesia using a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) system is regarded as the ideal option for systemic opioid analgesia.	2.0983959449815033
While PCA devices are not yet commonly used in all recovery units, the use of repetitive boluses on demand is still the most frequent form of administration in postoperative pain therapy.	2.371351083047641
In a study under double-blind conditions 135 ASA I and II patients were assigned at random to group I (infusion group) or group B (bolus group) when they first requested pain treatment after abdominal surgery.	1.963091999208966
The patients in group I received an initial intravenous loading dose of 100 mg tramadol, followed by an infusion of 12 mg/h tramadol for 24 h; if necessary, repeated boluses of 50 mg tramadol were given.	2.142041415943541
In group B the patients received a placebo infusion instead of the tramadol infusion; otherwise, the procedure was the same.	2.279077438970092
Pain relief was monitored by means of a VAS (visual analogue scale) up to 6 h after surgery.	2.333266341850568
We investigated the retrograde assessment of analgesia by the patients after 6 h, how often repetitive boluses were required, and the amount of analgesics administered in 6 and 24 h. Results.	2.361673150320017
The pain relief was assessed as excellent or good by 76.5% of group I and 65.6% of group B; 19.1% of group I and 26.9% of group B assessed the analgesic effect as satisfactory; 4.4% of group I and 7.5% of group B complained of insufficient analgesia.	1.9331587507093935
In group I 69.2% requested only one or no repetitive bolus, compared with 40.3% in group B, while two or more boluses were demanded by 30.8% in group I and 59.7% in group B.	2.0147662442664105
The average analgesic consumption after 6 h was 223.5 +/- 53.7 mg tramadol in group I and 176.6 +/- 63.1 mg tramadol in group B, respectively.	2.05410255157735
While the consumption during the first 6 h was comparable, from then on the consumption in group I increased significantly.	2.3998975710061767
Side effects were reported by 25% in both groups.	2.358070923912282
They were clinically irrelevant and did not necessitate termination of the clinical trial in any case.	2.422022500743974
During the study period pulse and blood pressure remained within the normal range and did not show any significant changes.	2.241884404748053
The fact that the patients in group I requested far fewer repetitive boluses than those in group B and the assessment by the patients led to the conclusion that treatment in the infusion group is better than that in the bolus group.	2.527077295203193
Concerns that a significantly higher consumption of analgesics would cause unwanted side-effects have proven unfounded.	2.3202298030315323
Six hours after surgery, when analgesia was evaluated by the patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups.	2.8806987974048504
Not until the maintenance infusion had been administered for a further 18 h, was the tramadol consumption within the infusion group significantly higher.	2.0881786462874565
Thus, we should consider continuing unreduced administration of the maintenance infusion 6 h after operation.	2.1505722710687607
The concept of tuberculid was introduced by Darier in 1896.	2.032413529457029
In contrast to "true" cutaneous tuberculosis, properties of the tuberculids were explained by an hyperergic response to myobacteria or their fragments released from a different site of manifest or passed tuberculous infection.	1.7892683030319094
Key features include a strongly positive tuberculin skin test, evidence of concomitant manifest or past tuberculosis, and prompt response to antituberculous therapy The inability to culture M. tuberculosis or to demonstrate it microscopically from lesional biopsies, together with reports on tuberculid-like eruptions after BCG vaccination, supports this concept.	1.6683920898627866
Clinical manifestations are lichen scrophulosorum, papulo-necrotic tuberculids and erythema induratum of Bazin.	1.8721864969541944
The existence of tuberculids has been questioned, however, because the clinical and histological appearances are not always specific.	2.911741619853615
An increasing number of case reports on tuberculids, new immunological tests and molecular biology-based techniques for the detection of mycobacteria have shed new light on the tuberculid concept.	2.0359857884530768
Case Report: A 20-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of a pneumothorax.	2.929075090215604
A secondary amenorrhea was coexisting.	2.4767585309465074
On the abdominal wall and in the anogenital area a maculopapular exanthema was visible.	2.4233896261634538
Chest X-ray and HR-CT showed a interstitial lung disease with high probability of histiocytosis X which was confirmed by biopsies of lung and skin tissue.	2.1779452049526813
The cause of amenorrhea was a histiocytic infiltration of the pituitary stalk.	2.2168020478564996
Conventional "consensus-treatment" for adults with vinblastine, prednisone and etoposide did not prevent relapsing bilateral pneumothoraces.	1.8715150537897502
Treatment was successful with the protocol as proposed by the international study for children.	2.2220567165585345
This treatment is characterized by higher dosage and combination with 6-mercaptopurine.	2.5793732192668632
The prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor.	2.6364554041344874
The hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70-90% in patients with solid tumors to 75-90% in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95% in patients after bone marrow transplantation.	2.3600172500771923
The number of patients referred to intensive care units is however increasing, due to improvements in the general treatment of malignant diseases.	2.4546574772548126
This results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients.	2.2952781839487666
Since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified.	2.2002475374630133
A reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures.	2.403413412975805
Patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with vasopressors is necessary and/or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present.	2.1172573743475023
Intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases.	2.2619575372106837
For other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making.	2.797929871037705
On the basis of a solution-oriented marital therapy, the different within-session effects of four different types of questions in systemic therapy (lineal, strategic, circular, and reflexive), as described by Tomm (1989), were tested.	1.927023847446819
In this single case study, the method of plan analysis (Caspar 1989) was used to categorize the client's reactions to the four types of therapeutic questions.	2.2889885218734083
the client, the clients' interaction, and the therapeutic interaction), whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change.	2.330612846048991
Interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife, who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change.	2.1912813559050064
For the husband, who preferred the role of a cotherapist and demonstrated only little motivation for change, results were not as predicted.	2.090657815427199
Some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects.	2.1873231715083814
Prerequisites for experimental study designs are extremely difficult to realise under prehospital emergency conditions.	2.0219968265871575
Results obtained in animal experiments always need validation with prehospital or inhospital patient studies.	2.029572958959145
Investigations related to emergency medicine are, however, an ethical obligation on behalf of the patient.	2.460404277528929
A retrospective analysis of the available literature should be considered a prerequisite for prospective randomised and controlled studies.	2.8675819647621323
Frequently, a pilot study or feasibility trial needs to precede the actual study.	2.106661298713083
Informed consent must be obtained for all patient studies.	2.296873046837741
However, under emergency conditions informed consent cannot always be obtained due to unconsciousness, etc.	2.0327102353645508
Nevertheless, the following principles should be observed: (a) randomised studies are essential, even in emergency medicine; (b) they are ethically acceptable if the treatment provided for the study group is at least equivalent to the therapy for the control group; ( c) only these preconditions guarantee that the patient always receives treatment in accordance with the standard of treatment.	2.217426415714184
If the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give informed consent, the principle of deferred consent is acceptable.	2.1178783084052983
The deferred consent principle should be carefully documented.	2.3892895392448854
A prospective randomized study represents the gold standard for an investigation, even under emergency conditions.	2.2600991141611866
There are different principles of randomization: telephone or telefax randomisation, etc.	2.0658848195591952
Emergency medicine investigations need to be completed within a reasonable time frame which should, as a rule, not exceed 2 years.	2.2376866785677194
Otherwise, too many items might change without being noted.	2.1244432684727332
Curative treatment and the intention to treat are terms employed by ethics committees.	2.245430172563326
If an investigation does not bear in itself additional risk factors, it does not necessarily have to be brought before the ethics committee.	2.337861224439601
If, however, for example, the effect of obtaining blood samples is investigated separately for research purposes, the patient needs to be informed and sign the respective agreement.	2.638865432936626
In Germany the ethics committees have agreed to accept their respective decisions.	2.075092843803535
For multicentre and multinational studies, however, the ethics committees also need to accept decisions made by non-German ethics committees.	2.2070635634546125
Not all therapeutic principles can serve as the basis of prospective randomized studies because they need to be considered the present standard of care (e.g., endotracheal intubation, etc.).	2.5184584064462125
Nevertheless, the feasibility of a study should be assessed according to the 1-3 rating proposed by the American Heart Association.	2.441789621130217
In principle, the overall emergency physician protocol does not fulfill scientific requirements.	2.0822635655049218
Scores can be of importance for investigating different treatment regimens.	2.4379856810523406
Biases in emergency medicine studies focus on the variability of EMS, personnel qualifications, etc.	2.319978316532388
This is in part why it is extremely difficult to prove efficacy and efficiency in emergency medicine.	2.1234076982386325
The results of emergency medicine investigations should be published in suitable journals, i.e., journals with a reasonable rating.	2.0269506706309977
New antifungals for oral therapy have improved the chances of healing onychomycoses.	2.1436983934211367
Nevertheless, in daily practice the failure rate is 20-30% both with itraconazole and terbinafine.	2.153888848371316
In our investigations for the fungicidal effects of terbinafine, we could show that the same strain of Trichophyton rubrum or T. mentagrophytes in the rest period needs 1000 times higher concentration of terbinafine (2,0 to 0,002 µg/ml) for complete fungal killing as in the growth phase.	1.902799019976914
Thus resting fungi in the nail are not harmed, and if the concentration of terbinafine is lower than the MIC for the fungi, they can cause a relapse.	2.122286613577369
Itraconazole is a fungistatic agent.	2.557993325414421
Its concentration in the nail plate must be higher than the MIC for the causative fungi for a long time - 10 to 12 months.	2.3137448314116926
The usual short-term treatment of onychomycosis over 3 months can be insufficient in individual cases such as patients with disorders, e.g.	2.1166031237753256
circulatory disorders or slowed nail growth.	2.476431754036214
This paper presents an algorithm for automatic switching between atrial tracking and nontracking pacing mode based on a "4 out of 7" concept: if 4 out of 7 atrial intervals are sensed below a critical value, mode switching (MS) is automatically performed.	1.8230836285122176
The technical solution in Medtronic Kappa 700 dual chamber devices is explained together with an evaluation of advantages and possible limitations.	1.9328037191025926
The "4 out of 7" algorithm offers a quick MS; by the addition of a "blanked flutter search" algorithm integrated into this concept, the detection of atrial flutter is facilitated in a wider range of programmed AV intervals.	1.939502298013328
Therefore, to optimize the MS function, programming of the device (e.g., activation of a time delay before MS) should be carried out individually with respect to the intrinsic rhythm and arrhythmia of the patient.	2.232119932703028
Possible interactions between different programmable parameters should also be taken into consideration.	2.1700417067204443
Some guidelines are presented in this paper.	2.587852410937332
Finally, the use of extended stored diagnostic data seems to be crucial to evaluate pacemaker performance, incidence of atrial arrhythmias, and (as far as possible) confirmation of the stored data themselves by assessment of stored intracardiac electrograms.	2.142011316650259
Between 1983 and 1991 ten patients with chronic frontal sinus disease underwent frontal osteoplastic flaps with fat obliteration.	2.1198945694412767
In order to judge operative success on a long-term basis all patients were called for postoperative follow-up.	2.3432059273592407
They then completed a questionaire, in which they were asked about postoperative complaints.	2.354178920464052
Additionally, sinuses were examined by computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR).	2.289079799596987
Among the patients evaluated seven had no complaints, and no evidence of disease could be found by medical examination.	2.507132174890867
CT scans showed complete obliteration of the frontal sinuses in all patients.	2.5062629875700093
Additional results could not be obtained when compared to CT.	3.062748952173356
Overall operating success could only be determined by clinical assessment and confirmed the value of the frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration.	2.4374411350787013
The objective of our trial was to evaluate the significance and usefulness of sentinel lymphadenectomy (SLNE) for the staging of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients.	2.2312228041938336
The study presented illustrates the method and our results.	2.3469589563744053
As has been documentated for melanoma, the first lymph node [sentinel node (SLN)] to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor is the expected first site of lymph-node metastasis.	2.025066821385618
The database presented includes 12 patients with operable breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes.	2.152962856081172
In 11 cases the described method was applicable.	2.301006020360672
In only one case was there no correlation between the histology of the SLN and the axillary specimen.	2.1823355972587652
Successful completion of examination of a large number of patients with a long follow-up has the potential of reducing the number of axillary dissections and of significantly reducing morbidity in the majority of breast cancer patients.	3.0547525678538445
Background: Information on the extent and degree of the thermal effect produced is of great importance for control of the laser dosage in laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK) and for postoperative follow-up.	2.142035811000414
We investigated on acute LTK effects which information images obtained by optical low coherence tomography (OCT) offer compared to those obtained by polarization microscopy.	1.8714796881977878
In cases with protected left main stenosis by previous bypass surgery or as an emergency intervention in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is performed as an alternative treatment strategy to bypass surgery.	2.170463406209652
Coronary angioplasty of an unprotected left main coronary artery, had an unacceptably high procedure-related mortality rate and should therefore not be performed even in cases of emergency intervention.	2.2233335510828716
The risk stratification of the procedure can be evaluated by the proposed grading of left main artery protection.	2.50995620146714
Hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure.	2.2346376135731396
There are a few reports of hypocalcemic children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism.	2.2973830724440623
In all these patients, however, cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years.	3.0030706582746003
In addition, other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism, e.g., convulsive seizures, had been present prior to cardiac symptoms.	1.997466114603469
In this publication, Nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms, etiology and pathogenesis.	2.3969066623385196
The diseases to be considered when making a differential diagnostis are pointed out.	2.4170187065518465
Clarification of the etiology is still pending.	2.7423591253807342
Molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings.	2.4525196415490638
A case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist.	2.6019716768375183
Possibilities and problems in relation to therapy are demonstrated.	2.6818292608748457
The results of ankle arthroplasty have generally been disappointing compared to other forms of arthroplasty.	2.120207698221207
The present survey of results of ankle arthroplasty deals with the anatomical, the kinemasiological the biomechanical and the biological features of the ankle joint.	2.1917043493994335
From the study of the results displayed in the literature and those of my own series it can be stated that a modern ankle arthroplasty should respect the normal anatomy and kinemasiology.	2.275348845534205
Biomechanically it should work as a normal ankle joint i. e. cylindrical mobility, congruency and a possibility for normal torque within the ankle mortise.	2.014946192666263
The prosthesis components should only be fixed in solid subchondral bone, and preferably without cement.	2.1634993590061264
Only compressible forces should act at the bone-prosthesis interface.	2.2103176774165565
The axis of the ankle joint as well as of that of the hindfoot should be aligned to normal.	3.025322805194551
Meticulous surgery and special guide instruments are absolute necessities.	2.247226596594406
Restoration of muscle power and gait postoperatively are essential for a good and lasting result.	2.2822188455392145
The indication for ankle arthroplasty is mainly cases of osteoarthritis (primary or traumatic) and rheumatoid arthritis.	2.0251068347080468
Contraindications are talus necrosis, Charcot joints, extreme osteoporosis, severe arteriosclerosis, and very aggressive arthritis.	1.9082747861114653
Mental disorders and neurological disorders may also be contraindications.	2.62435622913655
Furthermore, the patients should agree not to perform sports involving jumping and running or other ankle demanding activities.	2.0046803880285022
The average annual failure rate should not exceed 1 % if these recommendations are followed.	2.0803058487351107
Elbow flexion plays a key role in the overall function of the upper extremity.	2.9827072510314965
In the case of unilateral complete brachial plexus lesion, restoration of elbow flexion will dramatically increase the patient's chances of regaining bimanual prehension.	1.8932286876385993
Furthermore, depending on the type of reconstruction, stability of the glenohumeral joint as well as some supination function of the forearm can be restored to a varying degree at the same time.	2.4796064362273214
Depending on the level of brachial plexus lesion and/or reinnervation, different reconstructive procedures are available.	2.475678322475118
In order to select the best treatment option for the patient it is necessary to known the extent of the lesion of the brachial plexus and/or ventral upper arm muscles, to time the operation appropriately, to be aware of all treatment possibilities and to recall the special problems of tendon transfer for brachial plexus patients.	2.251687416509491
Our concept is based on our experience with more than 1100 patients presenting a brachial plexus lesion between 1981 and 1996 and treated in our institution.	2.440426991399865
There were 528 operative revisions of the brachial plexus.	2.3048817147483427
Some 225 patients underwent secondary muscle/tendon transfers.	2.2054499209885043
In 35 patients elbow flexion was reconstructed by bipolar latissimus dorsi transfer (n = 10), triceps-to-biceps transfer (n = 15), modified flexor/pronator muscle mass proximalization (n = 6) and multiple-stage free functional muscle transfer after intercostal nerve transfer (n = 4).	1.9292555858018074
The recently published official "Guidelines for Prevention of Intravascular-Device Associated Infections" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	1.5363697691845155
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the offical German guidelines.	1.7861885416227183
We assessed the interindividual diagnostic variance of 39 experienced arthroscopists by the Kappa Cohen interobserver variation analysis using videotapes of eight different patients with different diagnoses.	1.8150448859064672
Arthroscopically normal findings showed a relatively acceptable interobserver correlation.	2.318275272163118
Pathological changes, in contrast, often showed very little correlation, especially in the synovial membrane of the suprapatellar recess, in the cartilage of the femoropatellar groove and the posterior cruciate ligament.	2.4288899669028017
In patellar alignment there was also great interobserver variation.	2.2736515775371355
Clinical relevance: When comparing arthroscopic findings with other imaging techniques the above results should be taken into account.	2.063874410097368
Furthermore, these results will affect the significance of medical expertise based only on pictures.	2.1963354499721772
In addition, medical cost billing, which is based on arthroscopic findings, has to take into account that a wrong diagnosis is possible and therefore charges will be wrong.	2.307311768011399
Squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4% of all invasive carcinomas of the breast.	2.624470318286616
Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare, since they occur in less than 1% of all primary invasive breast carcinomas.	2.431719549198568
In order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin, especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell carcnoma from a different location.	2.159616681059626
Causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear.	2.6557566873869227
A pluripotent embryonal stem cell origin is discussed, considering the phylogenetic descent of the mammary gland from skin appendages.	1.922391844856616
Squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma.	2.6866649111308787
Here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role.	2.1204952310544036
The number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years.	2.042336042880376
These tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory pseudocapsule.	2.049514901059743
The limited success of thrombolytic therapy and the high percentage of patients who have to be excluded from lysis has resulted in the alternative application of primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction.	2.5434176903306485
Randomized studies so far available have shown a significant decrease of hospital mortality by primary PTCA as compared to thrombolysis.	2.4117070756196393
Adjuvant stent implantation and a wider administration of glycoprotein IIA/IIIB inhibitors may further reduce mortality.	1.9927922707156944
For logistic and financial reasons however, not all patients with acute myocardial infarction can benefit from this therapeutic approach in spite of the high density of health care in Germany.	2.4741995161781123
Primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction should be left to experienced centres and investigators.	2.2155400940426095
Of utmost importance is a reduction of the present "onset-to-opening" times by information campaigns, an improved triage, use of transportation times for pre-hospital lysis and improved thrombolytic agents.	2.215002691312159
Some 245,000 sporting accidents occur yearly in Switzerland.	2.113047777267833
The social accident costs amount to approximately 1.8 billion francs per year.	1.9754316451581497
Every second sporting accident occurs during a ball game.	2.170834336351666
For the shown sporting activities, distortion is the most common type of injury among adults and contained fractures are most common in children.	2.2371348625367937
As is to be expected, the number of accidents has grown along with the exploding popularity of snowboarding and in-line skating.	2.457954808183131
These new sporting activities show no unknown injury patterns which would demand new treatment methods.	1.9724414574280789
Abstract:  The combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex.	2.094984872772855
However, this method is technically pretentious and time consuming.	2.3637431768593875
Therefore, functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery.	2.2561189523117813
The aim of the presented study was the development of a protocol, which allows the integration of functional MEG data into presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation, as a routine method.	2.462763890061663
We report on a 15-year-old girl and her relatives with typical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII.	2.0207426851890946
Main symptoms of this disorder are fragile skin, easy bruisability, joint hypermobility, features suggesting premature aging, and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth.	1.8269306166940587
The inheritance of this type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant.	2.1908214977688134
The acute liver failure (ALF) is a complex syndrome resulting from loss of synthetic and metabolic functions of the liver.	2.287706911602716
Despite recent advances in intensive care medicine patients with severe ALF have a very high mortality and the orthotopic liver transplantation still remains the only proven effective treatment of ALF.	2.324094361168855
Numerous attempts have been made to improve survival by using various extracorporeal support techniques, but none of these therapeutic approaches was able to increase the survival rate.	2.2713185987607574
Liver support systems based on detoxification procedures only could not influence the deleterious course of the disease.	2.0045894250967216
It is certain that an ideal liver support system should be capable to fulfil the liver's essential synthetic and metabolic functions as well as detoxification and excretion.	2.049919796096588
Over the last years the development of hybrid liver assist devices has aimed at replacing these liver functions and therefore might give an advantage over earlier systems based on detoxification techniques only.	1.9755791391093016
This article gives a short review of the various liver support systems and focuses then on the hybrid liver support systems, their construction and the remaining problems after the first clinical applications.	2.2114644987937946
After a latency period of 20 years, in a 39-year-old Austrian citizen of Chinese origin, a surgically removed rectal carcinoma, as well as the neighboring chronic inflammatory rectal mucosa with various degrees of dysplasia and one positive neighboring lymph node, showed helminthiasis in the histopathological examination, convincing us of a link between carcinoma and chronic helminthiasis.	1.93342886202857
Whereas the etiological context between chronic infection by Schistosoma haematobium and endemic frequent urinary bladder carcinoma is considered a matter of fact, whether of not the incidence of intestinal carcinoma is increased in connection with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis is controversial.	1.985859715391764
The etiological and pathogenetic link between helminthiasis and carcinoma should be considered in the same way as for other related inflammatory large-bowel diseases.	2.0846321359962965
In the sequence chronic inflammation - severe dysplasia, the formation of carcinoma could possibly occur.	2.0580835658577845
Besides a survey of trematodes parasitology and pathology, the link between rectal carcinoma and Schistosomiasis japonicum is pointed out by means of appropriate literature investigations.	2.13130070955019
Rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication.	2.452506342890728
Mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature.	2.3137515335582726
This paper reports on a 51-year-old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using V-Y technique.	2.3463070177860845
On day 8 after operation, the carotid bulb ruptured.	2.403128582457381
The rupture was due to local wall necrosis, as verified by histologic examination.	2.24416208840931
In an emergency procedure the necrotized tissue was resected and repaired using a Dacron patch.	2.062211408281014
Myocardial stunning (contractile dysfunction in the presence of normalized perfusion) and myocardial hibernation (contractile dysfunction matching reduced perfusion) have represented separate concepts of viable, but dyssynergic myocardium in the past.	1.987119085399656
However, in vivo experimental and clinical work suggests that repetitive ischemia due to coronary artery disease may induce a gradual transition between stunned and hibernating myocardium.	1.9954526455373436
Myocardial hibernation itself can result from a spectrum of ischemic conditions ranging from impaired myocardial blood flow reserve to frank hypoperfusion.	1.9614626003991338
With increasing severity and duration of ischemia, degeneration of cardiac myocytes, accumulation of glycogen and cell death ensue.	2.091802346544119
Additonally, there is an increase of extracellular matrix protein content leading to reparative fibrosis, which in turn limits functional recovery.	2.4442969524322202
In the light of these structural features, the available methods for detection of viable myocardium, in particular dobutamine echocardiography and nuclear imaging techniques, offer complementary rather than contradictory information.	2.0014385886889237
Dobutamine echo has satisfactory sensitivity, excellent specificity, and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of viable dyssynergic myocardium.	2.223739692393552
While in the past only its predictive accuracy for segmental recovery has been validated, newer data show an improved survival after revascularization if at least four viable dyssynergic left ventricular segments in a 16 segment model can be identified by dobutamine echocardiography.	1.7491555052605394
The complete (low and high dose) dobutamine protocol can elicit several types of contractile responses (sustained improvement in contraction or monophasic response, biphasic response, new wall motion abnormality) which should be interpreted in view of other clinical data including a previous infarction.	1.8049931392885816
If ischemia or viability is documented, revascularization should be performed promptly.	2.4048767624583984
A similar strategy should be followed in the setting of chronic coronary heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction.	2.320082388159536
Since the structural changes of hibernating myocardium are progressive, time to revascularization is critical.	2.0839770226450813
On the other hand, responsible therapeutic planning requires proof of ischemia or viability before initiating a potentially hazardous revascularization procedure.	1.764003363677609
The coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta.	2.1791383095238617
The coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body.	2.632385717658129
The indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart.	2.3134524981005775
The resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end-to-end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a recoarctation.	2.637021012977713
After a Vosschulte-aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen.	2.1681630785036474
This method, however, brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm.	3.2900323865196746
In the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm 22 years after a Vosschulte-aortoplasty.	2.2667475872427665
The aging of the Italian population is an emerging public health priority.	2.1133439581355495
In 2025 Italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over 50 years old.	2.361196274532431
To avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations, we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs.	2.00684572448829
Laboratory check, plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show abnormalitities immediately.	2.1493177911329764
Increasing enzyme parameters though indicated cholestasis.	2.350780278319063
Endoscopic retrograde choledocho-pancreaticography (ERCP) was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus.	2.15585588981541
It revealed a common-channel situation (ductus choledochus and pancreaticus) and choledocholithiasis.	1.9975390166461104
Papillotomy and stone-extraction could not remove abdominal pain.	2.16608071707659
Successful transplantation of autologous chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage defects requires an undisturbed matrix-synthesis of the transplanted cells.	2.120201019787974
This, in turn, is dependent on the composition of the synovial fluid (SF) of the respective joint.	2.5239018567407343
We addressed the question whether analysis of a patient's SF can predict the rate of matrix-synthesis of articular cartilage exposed to this SF in vitro.	2.2884360762844844
SF was obtained from 115 patients with disorders of the knee, including gonarthrosis (n = 44), meniscal tears (n = 10), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 53), and reactive arthritides (n = 8).	2.4208942504635607
In the SF, the following parameters were determined: Interleukin-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1-RA, TNF, Insulin-like growth-factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), IGFBP-3 as well as total proteinase activity and total collagenase activity.	2.483877166652931
In some cases, a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-I was added.	2.3295541212018485
SF from patients with OA or trauma, respectively, stimulated PG-synthesis of bovine cartilage more markedly than did SF from patients with rheumatic arthritides.	2.077159127407282
On the average, 60 percent of the SF-induced increase of cartilage matrix synthesis could be titrated out by an anti-IGF-I-AB.	2.050415515606262
The best predictor for the SF-effects on PG-synthesis of exposed cartilage was the proportion of free IGF-I (r = 0.573, p < 0.001, Spearman rank correlation) followed by the SF-concentrations of IGF-I (with a positive sign), IGFBP-3, IL-1, and TNF (all with a negative sign).	2.06532385975638
According to our data, IGF-I is the most important anabolic factor in human SF with respect to cartilage PG-synthesis.	2.6119650325946524
The proportion of free IGF-I seems to be of special importance in this regard.	2.5596758386936758
Low SF-levels of free IGF-I could be identified as a possible risk-factor for a sub-optimal protoeglycan synthesis of chondrocytes exposed to this synovial milieu.	2.157830990793677
The coincidence between panic disorder and depression is a well known phenomenon.	2.399264485558088
However, only few studies investigated the coincidence of panic disorder with schizophrenia.	2.1692511009618696
This may in part be explained by the fact that both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may mask the clinical symptoms of a panic disorder.	2.237451211155289
We report on a female patient suffering both from agoraphobia with panic disorder and paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10.	2.006552470332343
The productive psychotic symptoms responded well to treatment with a low dose of zotepine, whereas the panic disorder was effectively treated with a combined therapy with imipramine and cognitive behavioral therapy.	2.238137135633377
Although it has to be questioned whether the coincidence between panic disorder and schizophrenia reflects two different diagnostic entities, the occurence of symptoms of a panic disorder in schizophrenia deserve further attention because these may be treated efficiently by a specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.	1.923054864259089
A 54-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported.	2.08387701521578
Transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease.	2.404161100235252
After many years with only occasional disturbances, a distinct organic brain syndrome developed.	2.0660920016206767
Thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis; this was based on the history, liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in CT.	2.411679359512702
Despite the initiation of specific therapy, the patient died of the sequelae of the disease.	2.9730428637996473
At autopsy, characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal leptomeningitis were found with collapsed parasitic cysts.	1.8876012955442405
Additional intracerebral mesenchymal-glial reactions were less conspicuous.	2.1892080351105405
Residual ependymitis had caused aqueductal stenosis.	2.3730015354266056
Death was due to cachexia, bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess.	2.193186191194383
The clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed.	2.202380737099708
The disease has become rare in our country, but is globally the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system.	2.499523797443006
The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence, etiology and prognosis of severe connatal anemia in preterm and term children.	2.2266573341069513
All neonates born in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University of Kiel, were included.	2.206002873794426
In 18 of 18 367 (0.98 permil) liveborn neonates (birth weight 680-4050 g; 26-41 weeks of gestation), the initial hemoglobin level was below 10 g/dl.	1.9450254175579842
In those children with birth weight below 2500 g the incidence was 6.8 permil.	2.0607293177916604
In 17 of 18 cases the cause of anemia could be clarified.	2.402869143336188
In five preterm babies (28%) an acute fetofetal transfusion and in three newborns a fetomaternal transfusion was responsible for the onset of anemia.	2.138544635623188
In two cases there was Rh incompatibility, in two cases placental bleeding, and in another two cases fetal tumour bleeding caused the anemia.	2.2312597725975847
In one fully developed newborn there was severe disseminated intestinal bleeding of unknown cause.	1.9651012641438648
Another child suffered from EBV infection, and one had trisomy 13 with multiple malformations.	2.307678267903145
Ten children (55%) had to be resuscitated due to hypovolemic shock.	2.4647382753371394
Fifteen children were intubated and ventilated mechanically.	2.366884918168478
Seven children (39%); (six preterm babies and the newborn with trisomy 13) died between days 1 and 6.	2.0259400729192407
Five of these seven children had to be resuscitated at birth.	2.435491042710016
Six children (33%) showed evidence of neurologic disease when discharged; five of these were resuscitated previously.	2.0514843584616895
Five children (28%) including three full-term babies were developed normally.	2.1867487735546605
In conclusion, severe anemia with hemoglobin below 10 g/dl is very rare but serious.	2.103770075387852
It seems necessary to optimize primary resuscitation by immediate transfusion and monitoring of central venous pressure by umbilical vein catheter.	2.007204182605372
The prognosis can be influenced in a positive way.	2.4873922832639077
Diagnosis of bacterial infection and/or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine.	2.6102603995049733
White blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) due to noninfectious causes.	2.2947075358515954
There is a number of non-infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and CRP elevation.	2.567095754204561
In the last 3 years, Procalcitonin (PCT) was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection, especially sepsis.	2.224644751754699
PCT appears to have several advantages; it is of non-hepatic (yet unknown) origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency.	2.3910807007099297
There is no PCT-increase in acute graft-rejection, viral disease, and autoimmune disorders.	1.9933239970533174
Some studys showed a prognostic value of PCT in sepsis due to peritonitis and pancreatitis.	2.0890955364507326
PCT appears to be a new and helpful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients.	2.823697737110379
Further studies are needed to finally established PCT in the daily management of critically ill patients.	2.106177222593958
At this time significantly higher costs are the major detraction to daily or frequent measurements.	1.9797898163678742
In this retrospective study, the meniscal status of 45 patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears is reported.	2.0174469993686
Treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and bracing.	2.5794638792248548
The mean follow-up was 8 years.	2.6842080923256497
Twenty-nine (65%) patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of 3 years after the ACL injury during the follow-up period.	2.322508002975786
Rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears.	2.720385313649518
The most common tear of the medial meniscus was the bucket-handle type, followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn.	2.2263050915335794
Secondary reconstruction of the ACL was necessary in 24 patients complaining of the meniscus giving way.	2.5728313325922496
The remaining five patients had rearthroscopy 4 years after the ACL injury and a partial meniscectomy and ACL reconstruction was performed.	2.176993706183794
Sixteen patients (35% of the overall sample) had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow-up period, but discontinued their sporting activities.	2.162882751048091
Results indicate the increasing incidence of meniscal tears during ACL insufficiency.	2.2370643638438144
We recommend that patients with ruptures of the ACL should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and mensical repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously.	2.347886686468061
Four children, 4 to 10 years old, with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA; starting dosage 2 mg/kg per day) and prednisolone.	2.3738705949305983
All children had previously received systemic steroids and/or cytotoxic agents, which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects.	2.106796281609978
In one child, suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved.	2.2785891872172646
In a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function, although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage.	2.0407025333035214
In the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation.	2.325275369753986
During the time of treatment, ranging from 11 to 26 months, no serious side effects were observed.	2.5227802487348407
All patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia.	2.087882782758704
In our <\d> experience, cyclosporin A (CsA) combined with low-dose systemic steroids is useful as a therapeutic alternative to steroids alone and to other immunosuppressive agents in severe cases of chronic uveitis in childhood.	1.9407563730022064
Allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare.	2.284160670092709
In most cases the reactions are caused by different red pigments.	2.2081207238087925
While in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts (cinnebar) and cadmium sulphide, now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions.	1.955465473893086
A 42-year-old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos.	2.2830190620886994
Histologically a chronic granulomatous, partly fibrous inflammation with transfollicular elimination of pigment granules was found.	1.8901794611483773
Spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed, simultaneously with depigmentation and scarring of the overlying skin.	2.2947671053599117
The pigment used for tattooing was found to be an aromatic azo derivative.	2.656044332533278
In addition to a positive cutaneous reaction to the dye, the patient also showed a positive patch test to Napthol AS, used for the coupling of different dyes in the textile industry.	2.1581858789039843
Borrelia burgdorferi specific DNA has been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in different specimens of patients with Lyme disease (LD).	2.180106713235469
The aim of the present study is to evaluate PCR-diagnostic of urine specimens regarding rheumatologic diagnosis of Lyme disease.	1.9744832658377305
Urine specimens of 77 patients  (LD, n=34; undifferentiated arthritis (UA), n=25; arthralgia/myalgia (AM), n=18) and 15 controls were investigated.	1.889069090442005
Flagellin gene  (60 specimens) or OspA-plasmid  (32 specimens) were used as targets.	2.109852492934129
Sensitivity of the flagellin-nested-PCR was 27%, by OspA-nested-PCR only one positive PCR result was found.	1.8263807865805135
Despite of low sensitivity PCR enabled the correct diagnosis of LD in two patients classified as UA.	2.2354325936130293
Therefore, PCR can give valuable hints in single cases if LD is clinically suspected.	1.9432976363593155
Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy of a chemically standardized willow bark extract in the treatment of osteoarthritis.	2.524272258344176
Methods: Willow bark extract, in a dose corresponding to 240mg salicin/day, was compared to placebo in a 2-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.	2.190763936800949
The primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index.	2.083301838207469
Results: 78 patients (39 willow bark extract, 39 placebo) participated in the trial.	2.1688240376915746
A statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo group was observed in the WOMAC pain dimension (d=6.5mm, 95%C.I.=0.2-12.7mm, p=0.047); the WOMAC pain score was reduced by 14% from baseline level after two weeks of active treatment, compared to an increase of 2% in the placebo group.	2.051159053152423
Patient diary VAS confirmed this result, and likewise the final overall assessments showed superiority of willow bark extract over placebo (patients assessment, p=0.0002; investigators assessment, p=0.0073).	1.773443559686592
Conclusion: Willow bark extract shows a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis.	2.176520040414224
Background and methods: The aim of this study was to get more information about the prevalence of chronic pain in different practices of home physicians.	2.6540031746021997
900 patients of five different specialists (general medicine, internal medicine, neurology, orthopaedics, surgery) in the german town Bochum were investigated with a questionnaire about chronic pain.	2.0821530235724732
Chronic pain was defined as a continuous or intermittend pain of longer duration than six months.	2.2753940673048363
Confusion between syncope and epileptic seizures is a common problem in clinical practice.	2.377615856541131
Recently, new insights into the phenomenology of transient cerebral hypoxia have been gained from video analysis of experimentally induced syncope.	1.8949419877922724
Common elements of syncope include multifocal and generalized myoclonus, tonic body extension, automatisms, vocalizations, eye deviations and hallucinations.	1.7377890663000655
Thus, it is not the presence or absence of these features but their specific character that distinguishes syncope from epileptic seizures.	2.1274014096286664
Other clues for differential diagnosis include precipitating factors, premonitory symptoms and postictal events, such as tongue bites and postictal confusion, which has been identified as the single most powerful factor discriminating syncope from epileptic seizures.	2.0013846133505684
In contrast, incontinence and head injury are common in both conditions.	2.109556454107896
Investigations such as electroencephalogram, tilt testing and postictal prolactin or creatine kinase levels may aid diagnosis but are never diagnostic in isolation.	1.7626984552775204
In rare cases, hypoxic and epileptic mechanisms may interact within one attack.	1.989536802625762
In the past two decades increasing research efforts have focused on the molecular biology of the cell.	2.2900972061685407
In the beginning, these research activities were purely academic without any direct clinical relation.	2.0057751166487234
A series of important discoveries, initiated particularly by the unravelling of the genetic code and the discovery of the molecular basis of gene expression and genetics, the subsequent identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and finally the description of major mechanisms which induce genetic instability in cells, now indicate the way to many new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.	1.8730746958495228
In surgical oncology, these attempts are yielding the first clinical consequences.	2.166555685602389
Basic aspects of molecular cell biology as far as they are relevant for surgical oncologists are discussed.	2.0369715197419267
The compartment syndrome (cs) is characterized by an increased tissue pressure in a limited space.	2.390944058717004
Pathophysiologically, it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors.	2.5136731631935385
Cofactors are, for instance, the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs.	2.824713422546689
In particular, the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction, development of a capillary leak, protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space.	2.0254322858090275
An impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction.	2.2070611942078195
An arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the arteriolar pressure.	2.048520928608788
An accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load.	2.2052740114841116
In disadvantageous cases, the patients are in danger of developing a multi-organ deficiency syndrome (MODS) by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction, by intravasal volume loss and by a myonephropathic systemic reaction.	2.0863132875024766
Clinically, the patients suffer a disproportionate amount of pain, followed by neurological signs.	2.4285706903546664
Especially in noncompliant patients, tissue pressure measurement is useful.	2.2530334946934105
Resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of casts is important.	2.8684504217107976
In case of a manifest cs, dermatofasciotomy has to be performed as an emergency operation.	3.0138231274424787
Even if cs is diagnosed early and fasciotomy is carried out early, the development of sequellae cannot be avoided in every single case.	2.194432956403906
The object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid-term and long-term follow-up.	2.271003698829193
The mean follow-up for techniques was: Eden-Hybbinette-Lange 11.1 years (2.9-16.7 years), Weber 5.2 years (2.1-13.0 years), Putti-Platt 7.2 years (2.2-10.6 years), Bankart 1.6 years (0.5-3.2 years), and Morgan 3.5 years (2.8-5.1 years).	1.9580879207981938
We observed that the classic open Bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation, range of motion, sports activity, and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures.	2.2482869106212036
The results shows that nonanatomical, reconstructive, open procedures are not up to date.	2.046263663668362
The open Bankart procedure reconstructs the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only.	2.604767744568455
The classic open Bankart procedure seems to be the "gold standard" in open shoulder surgery today.	2.4909843595613275
The high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more stringent patient selection in the future.	2.126430116096005
Background: Our study compared the haemodynamic changes after spinal anaesthesia with 2% lignocaine and 0,5% plain bupivacaine.	2.171375534387855
Hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance.	2.925161824350585
When hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration, the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest.	2.567728127128584
Usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia.	2.117293167818156
Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, disorders of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, high-dose antibiotics, and immunsuppressive treatments may result in hyperkalemia.	2.3436179129364207
The most important pathogenetic mechanisms are (1) renal insufficiency, (2) hyporeninemic hypoaldeosteronism, (3) tubular disorders, and (4) cellular disorders.	2.5089804548665438
Background: CMV retinitis is the most common opportunistic ocular infection and the main cause of blindness in AIDS patients with a T-helper cell count <= 50/µl.	2.370886099093288
Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half-life time after phosphorylation intracellularly.	2.1232123236180493
It is effective against CMV and can be given intravenously and intravitreally.	2.4216434547636045
The aim was to offer an alternative therapy for CMV retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it.	1.9573283502986967
The efficacy and tolerance of intravitreal injections of cidofovir should be evaluated.	2.1079000396467906
A case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported.	2.273267822470794
One of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma, and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland.	1.8994103745037008
The relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata, dermal cylindroma and multiple trichoepitheliomata is discussed.	1.9307815741522674
In view of the risks of a varicella infection during pregnancy and the more and more observed severe course of infection, varicella infection has to be considered as a serious disease.	2.449506947017857
The initial antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis has major implications for the course of the disease.	2.141756045109108
The current spectrum of infectious agents must be considered.	2.3940047654082
Antibiotics have to reach sufficient concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid for a bactericidal action to occur at the site of infection.	2.1633391223870913
Frequent problems arising in this condition are: (1) the non-observation of listerial infections, (2) the use of antibiotics not sufficiently active against gram-positive bacteria in pneumococal meningitis, (3) the development of meningitis following the use of ciprofloxacin in respiratory tract infections, (4) the hasty change in antibiotic regimens in focal parenchymal infections during delayed response to therapy, (5) the use of bacteriostatic antibiotics, and (6) the delay in administering sufficient antibiotic therapy during fulminate meningococcal meningitis.	2.2773421786230394
Problems arising from these conditions are illustrated by case reports.	2.2701355354185937
Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease-modifying drugs aims towards better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy.	2.4964193251573885
Based on a broad variety of clinical studies, revealing more or less positive results, several combinations have been suggested:...	2.1417679446575058
The management of 178 patients with liver trauma (132 male, 46 female; mean age 34 years (range 3-88) presenting from January 1979 to August 1996 is reviewed.	1.840750781808635
There were 165 cases of blunt trauma and 13 cases of penetrating injury.	2.135858949115955
110 cases were classified as simple injuries (grade I or II) and 68 cases as complex injuries (grade III to V).	2.2222050965148825
The overall mortality was 32 % (57 patients).	2.2013199373012866
The mortality for true hepatic injury was 15.7 %.	2.2267548159155632
None of the patients with penetrating injuries died.	2.743564000877078
Mortality was inflenced by the type of liver injury and the number of associated injuries.	2.7030092855564085
The postoperative complication rate was 55 %.	2.7058363057790173
The most-frequent postoperative complications related to the hepatic injury were intrahepatic or subcapsular hematoma (12.9 %) and postoperative bleeding (9.6 %).	1.9702339164811966
Intraabdominal abscess formation was seen in 2.8 %.	2.7973967180504578
Operative therapy for liver injuries depends on the grade of the injury.	2.684732597474585
The majority of liver injuries can be managed by simple techniques, including electrocautery and application of hemostatic agents.	2.036351458573085
In complex injuries hepatotomy, direct vessel ligation, and debridement of necrotic tissue is the method of choice (Pachter's procedure).	2.0330349050313115
In non-controlled bleeding, perihepatic picking is a standard method.	2.215420847165098
Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate knowledge, practices, and opinions on tobacco and oral health among dentists of the Berlin Dental Association using a questionnaire.	1.9624652112609806
Materials and methods: Questions focussed on smoking habits, knowledge about oral malignancies and premalignancies and practical approaches to screening for oral mucosal diseases and other associations of tobacco with oral changes.	1.7777882879262297
The questions related to risk factors and behavioural counselling for patients and associated constraints.	2.498312175813436
Results: Of a total of 4000 questionnaires sent, 483 were received for evaluation (12.1%).	2.0372082957158875
Of respondents 9.5% were regular smokers.	2.3433332827284534
The median number of oral malignancies observed was 3.	2.2398068030960663
Knowledge about some associations of oral changes such as wound healing was adequate.	2.102200548588059
Only 35% take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26.6% explain the side effects of tobacco.	2.122447782731452
Some 73.4% believed that the dentist could play a role in anti-tobacco counselling.	2.1037580830038873
Limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti-tobacco counselling.	2.1168372329575362
Conclusions: This study shows that there still is a considerable need for improvement of knowledge and for provision with effective anti-tobacco teaching material.	1.988578497450678
Since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti-tobacco counselling, adequate programmes in Germany should be inititated and followed up.	2.0477727898300664
Background: Last year's pilot study, which examined for the first time a representative group of patients with Chagas disease, showed that in this parasitosis changes in the ocular fundus can be expected in the form of defects of the retinal pigment epithelium.	2.5072546867287144
The posterior luxation of the shoulder joint is a rarely reported and often not recognized lesion in the clinical workday.	2.4307359100365953
The authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation.	2.402553404775803
In that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint.	2.0887120934399284
Finally they draw the readers attention to operative steps to prevent a reluxation of the shoulder joint.	2.0530611962497267
Cerebral MR examination and image interpretation during the infantile period require extensive knowledge of morphological manifestations, their pathophysiological background, and frequency.	1.9053283868130988
The choice of imaging parameters and image interpretation is demonstrated in infarctions and hemorrhages of the mature and immature brain.	1.9602562109376889
A review of the main differential diagnoses is also given.	2.5915160203780077
The relevance of MR spectroscopy and fetal MRI is discussed.	2.1809157689929792
Currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors.	2.670419642481238
One of them is the precise handling of optics.	2.187748579164299
Up to now, in our hospital 52 laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice - controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder, stomach, large bowel and hernia operations.	1.936431999317412
The visual field is determined by the surgeon.	2.849882344921238
In all cases handling of the robot arm was precise and the voice response exact and without technical problems.	1.891613403479548
In 20 further cases there was one assistant.	2.4748903434415346
A robot arm can be used successfully without problems by any laparoscopic surgeon in any operating theater.	2.2215463951501917
Urine specimens were collected from 49 persons up to 10 days after abstaining from cannabis use.	2.1918900971982787
Urine samples (n = 135) were investigated for free and conjugated 9-carboxy-11-nor tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) by LC/MS/MS and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) by GC/MS prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis.	1.822855722531769
Concentrations for free and conjugated THCCOOH were measured with reference to 100 mg creatinine/dL urine.	2.188039069323906
Cannabis use was classified as light, moderate and heavy according to the current literature.	2.6650902878190443
In all groups chosen free and bound THCCOOH was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day.	2.2885184496304207
Urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of THCCOOH and THCCOOH glucuronide.	2.0795919896337636
Within 4-6 days the concentrations of free and glucuronidated THCCOOH in urine samples of heavy users decreased to those ranges present in urine samples of moderate and light users.	2.0062488334428235
In frequent users, THC glucuronide and 11-OH-THC glucuronide could be found up to 1 and 3 days after abstinence, respectively.	2.077177167951537
In light users, neither THC glucuronide nor 11-OH-THC glucuronide was detectable.	1.9295887171986401
The determination of conjugated THC and 11-OH-THC in addition to free and bound THCCOOH is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use, but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption.	2.18573203954381
The participation of social work in inpatient psychiatric care is generally considered necessary, but there is a lack of empirical studies in this field.	2.4010252362792115
The analyses presented of a systematic documentation of social work interventions in 2038 cases during an 11-year period demonstrate that social workers are mostly involved in the treatment of chronic and previously treated patients.	2.2274996256507915
Interventions in younger patients, most of whom are suffering from psychoses, aim at rehabilitation through activity; in elderly patients with organic or depressive disorders, the major concern is to improve posthospital care; patients with neurotic or personality disorders comprise another group with a chronic course and a relatively poor outcome.	1.9703102240416945
As far as their goals are comparable, social workers and doctors agree on their objectives.	2.0018964145806653
Social workers usually see their own interventions as successful, but patient groups who benefit greatly can be differentiated from groups with poor outcome.	1.9248359184175146
Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscular rigidity and superimposed spasms.	2.6169411111736833
The etiology is still unknown and an autoimmune cause is discussed.	2.367403392925314
Many differential diagnoses of muscular rigidity and of induration of the skin have to be considered.	2.517721569517662
A 22 year old patient was admitted under suspicion of a stiff-man syndrome.	2.429951955854255
He has had developed a painful rigidity of the trunk, starting in the neck.	2.3102413538304294
Massive stiffness of the trunk with pale appearance of the skin and a beginning disorder of swallowing and respiration were observed.	2.3444487302932133
Clinical investigation, EMG, cerebrospinal fluid and laboratory findings were all normal, thus excluding a stiff-man syndrome and other neuromuscular diseases.	1.940345144401803
Skin biopsy showed typical changes of Buschke's scleredema adultorum, a rare connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology.	1.9572827629705738
Therapy with corticosteroide and ciclosporin led to a mild improvement of symptoms.	2.2609328725635476
Although rare, Buschke's scleredema adultorum should be regarded as a differential diagnosis of the stiff man syndrome.	2.4606267525221304
Urogenital infections are established as hazards to male fertility.	2.2225709116837784
Various pathophysiological hypotheses have evolved from experimental and clinical studies, facilitating explanation of the effects of bacteria and immunological events on reproductive tissues.	2.2104554727279506
Numerous current studies have identified and evaluated infectious mediators accounting for specific molecular events in urogenital infections.	1.9561962232103094
Valuable studies can be expected to appear in the future due to improvements in diagnostic procedures and new classifications of urogenital infections.	2.3883785424694297
X-ray or CT images allow only a limited three-dimensional orientation in presurgical planning.	2.421752980451752
Especially for the planning of internal hemipelvectomies with custom-made endoprosthesis and for periacetabular osteotomies a high-grade orientation is necessary.	2.1814397166052855
This orientation is improved by a 3D CT-controlled manufactured 1:1 model of the pelvis.	2.232930403602223
This enables an exact classification of defect and deformity, planning of resection planes, design of the suitable custom-made implant and simulation of the operation technique as preoperative quality control.	1.9174336729543777
An Ivalon-plug (PDA-plug) has been developed for transvenous closure of patent ductus arteriosus.	2.1173215117805078
It can be introduced into the ductus through standard venous sheaths with a diameter von 8-16 French.	2.059025135178493
In case of malpositioning the system can be pulled back into and retrieved through the sheath.	2.027795768768831
In animal experiments endothelialization of the implanted material was demonstrated.	2.2540651761148154
PDA-closure was attempted in 58 patients; the procedure was successful in 57 cases; a residual ductal flow was present in eight patients.	2.184341052246658
During a follow-up of up to 24 months there were no complications.	2.9964545827693607
Using 8 different monoclonal antibodies, immunohistology was performed on 36 follicular adenomas and on 28 follicular, 34 papillary, 27 medullary and 29 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid.	1.95715147020534
The panel of antibodies was directed against broad-spectrum cytokeratins (pan-CK, antibody lu-5), against basic and acid high-molecular-weight CK of types  1, 5, 10 and 14, against basic ( 5 and 6) and acid high-molecular-weight CK ( 13) and against basic ( 7 and  8) and acid low-molecular-weight CK ( 19 and  20).	1.8925887153355814
With the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas, nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan-CK, CK 8 and CK 19.	1.8774596299122417
CK 20 expression was exclusively shown for 2 medullary carcinomas.	2.2368842242305327
Reactivity for high-molecular-weight CK could only, each time focally, be demonstrated for 14 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas and for 2 anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation.	1.8975606250493027
Thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not decorated by any of the CK antibodies applied.	2.1994122310795916
CK 7 staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in 26 papillary cancers.	2.2821284030513542
In contrast, such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma, medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with 5 follicular carcinomas.	2.0400076901281228
These results confirm earlier studies in that CK 20 expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad-spectrum CK antibodies.	1.8409753382064387
New is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non-papillary thyroid tumours regarding CK 7 expression.	1.9260314427766223
This result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern.	1.9462551790527627
Purpose: To compare reading speed and reading comfort between closed-circuit television systems (CCTVs) with different image refresh rates.	1.8265961210853603
This surveillance study presents a literature review concerning the very inhomogeneous care emphasis of the acute psychosocial crisis both with respect to crisis insight and therapy methods and to professional responsibility.	2.0660522350876596
In detail general care models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention are described, as well as disorder- and event-specific concepts and papers on crisis intervention with children, teen-agers, and adolescents of the last 10 years.	1.98835514855989
In addition, the contributions of the empirical psychotherapy research and their results are presented as far as they are relevant to crisis intervention.	2.01683840040278
In recent years many different systems for transcatheter closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD) have been developed and tested.	2.127540774527557
However, all systems presently available have some special disadvantages.	2.108377557529662
The recently introduced Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO), though, appears promising.	1.8901068814330346
It is a self-expanding and self-centering double disc made from a Nitinol mesh, which is tightly woven to give mechanical strength.	2.0949668197550144
Both discs are separated by a connecting cylindrical portion.	2.203023482285435
Its diameter may be chosen, so that it corresponds to that of the ASD.	2.526707529415622
In the light of recent research findings the inappropriateness of many commonly accepted concepts in psychosomatic medicine is discussed.	1.840367212652266
They do not stand up to empirical scrutiny.	2.341713826584833
This applies both to sepcifity models and to duality of body and mind or of illness and health.	1.9400298287091193
The monocausal-psychogenetic view was replaced through a complex interplay of hierarchie somato-psychic circles which are to be integrated into a biosemiotic model.	1.8590666592161793
In terms of the self-object-body system a greater significance is attached to affects in the communication and acting receives an important interactive function.	1.8589044374843906
The effects of the altered theroretical positions on new therapy approaches are discussed.	2.1453933999574812
Perioperative, mostly silent ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease is difficult to detect by clinical examinations.	2.830218932901357
Herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease-causing microorganisms.	2.5969212638470642
Their prevalence can exceed 90% depending on the socioeconomic status of the population.	2.465952218204535
Since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation, herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance.	2.481908246002438
While treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences.	1.8950958788446728
Additionally, development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment.	2.256946351138058
We present a case history of a man with a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal vestibule.	2.3602059991905984
Possible causes for the development of resistance in herpes infections and the use of famciclovir and forscarnet as two therapeutic alternatives to aciclovir are discussed.	2.334357361111078
Tumor invasion of the portal vein by ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is classically known as a criterion for inoperability.	2.1143684254143875
Despite improvement in operation techniques for portal vein resection during Whipple's procedure and acceptable mortality and morbidity, in the case of uncertain tumor infiltration vascular resection cannot be recommended in general.	2.112401363365854
The problem is the preoperative detection of tumor infiltration of the portal vein.	2.4127076870520443
Often the surgeon is confronted with unsuspected macroscopic portal vein infiltration or tumor adhesion during the operation.	2.0424391541144145
Between 1986 and 1995 105 patients underwent Whipple's procedure for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head in our department.	1.96761933393115
In eight of these cases partial portal vein resection was performed because of macroscopic tumor infiltration or tumor adhesion.	2.235353650098535
In four of the eight cases histological tumor infiltration of all vascular layers was found.	2.0926815280794537
In the others we found no or only adventitial tumor invasion.	2.1907382356828715
The patients without tumor infiltration of the portal vein showed a survival time after surgery of 27.78 months in contrast to 6.67 months in the group with histologically proven tumor infiltration.	2.228864224664136
Endovascular, intraportal ultrasound (IPEUS), a new diagnostic procedure, can give helpful information regarding portal vein involvement.	2.253020416776278
Although the IPEUS is not a standard diagnostic procedure it was shown to detect portal vein infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity.	2.3603691895969994
Our results indicate that in such cases where portal vein infiltration has been excluded by IPEUS, patients with macroscopic tumor adhesion do benefit from partial portal vein resection.	2.024145151774457
Progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies.	2.0658428141601988
This does also apply for stroke treatment: New pathophysiological knowledge, positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the demostrated importance of early treatment at Stroke Units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency.	2.0152366417512546
Timing is of utmost importance.	2.5590737549952416
Time-based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy.	2.1168948175163598
The treatment process is divided into three phases: alarming, pre-hospital and in-hospital phase.	2.4137644695885396
The effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables (personnel, technical equipment, course of the disease, etc.).	2.1983536741299523
Knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses, which allows an aimed improvement, e.g.	1.9473090710587604
public education, training of paramedics and medical personnel.	2.288189962710808
Modern communication systems allow new information transfer, which can help to avoid unnecessary transport of patients.	2.547171343522719
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a severe complication after heart valve replacement.	2.5543831528466314
Incidence ranges in literature between 0.1% and 2.3% (mean 0.4%) per patient year (pty).	1.8860509722512915
PVE is classified as "early" or "late" (occurence within or after 60 days following heart valve replacement).	2.0274527812018652
In this review we present the clinical outcome of PVE as well as the most common diagnostic criteria (Duke criteria), the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria.	2.9224675990781677
The spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards.	2.4995282329934123
Recently intra-atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.	2.478315011199201
Low-energy intra-atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus rhtyhm f.ex.	2.250807432214781
after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided.	2.2566194415516536
Additionally this new technique has led to the development of implantable atrial defibrillators for the treatment of selected patients suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation.	2.9597838886947483
Intra-atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method, but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far.	2.353662779123581
Especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy.	2.0964014002622213
Modern imaging techniques are a substantial part of treatment planning for minimally invasive radiotherapeutic procedures.	2.197474447116567
The aim is three-dimensional assessment of the target volume and adjacent critical structures.	2.6584717470595707
In this paper, we report on our clinical experience with a precise system for stereotactic image correlation.	2.2178338142850693
Hereby, the advantages of each imaging modality can be combined.	2.4557795101455526
Precise immobilization of the patient is a prerequisite.	3.7407216155700262
The immobilization method has an accuracy of less than 1 mm.	2.4746723324324176
This method was evaluated in a clinical study in which a tumor control rate of 93 % was achieved in patients with brain metastases after stereotactic single high dose radiotherapy.	2.4425016206233052
The integration of functional image information, such as blood flow or activation of cerebral cortical areas, will be evaluated in the future.	2.3748335191647194
Olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (IPS).	2.5676052867272845
In contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of IPS, clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed.	2.22784808801955
This may be due to the lack of an easy-to-use,  inexpensive, standardized, and reliable test.	2.553654401787177
In this study, we administered the newly developed "sniffin' sticks" test to a group of 40 nondemented IPS patients and compared the results with 40 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and smoking habits.	2.0066257853172096
In all three subtests including odor identification, odor detection threshold, and odor discrimination, the control group scored significantly better than the IPS group, yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90% each.	1.8689621586052831
Our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in IPS can be found at early stages of the disease, appear bilaterally, and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism.	2.1522489696035887
Purpose: The goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional MRI to establish computer-based, preoperative therapy planning for tumors, instancing cervical carcinoma.	2.2624088516611773
Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but frequently lethal disease of the skin and mucosa of unknown etiology.	2.4396928946617167
Toxic metabolic and immunologic products in the serum have been discussed as possible causes.	2.278119033588058
For this reason we have performed plasmapheresis on these patients for many years.	2.1215849113065963
Results regarding survival and healing of the lesions are quite favorable, as exemplified with two patients described here who benefited from the procedure despite their old age.	1.981634387886746
In dermis and epidermis, there was a striking increase of macrophages and a relative increase of CD8-positive lymphocytes which might act as cytotoxic effector cells; these findings can be interpreted as the result of an immunological reaction.	2.033156483118369
An increased staining of lesional epidermis with TNF, as previously noted by other autors, should be interpreted with caution since necrotic cells are involved.	1.8537441974380346
On the basis of the clinical results, the pathogenetic considerations, and in view of the lack of specific treatment modalities, clinical studies concerning plasmapheresis for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis are recommended, particularly since this procedure is widely available and generally well tolerated.	2.378935019297659
The majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery.	1.9778979215034869
In problematic cases, however, optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved.	2.1944490553401015
In these cases, external frontal sinus surgery is indicated.	2.317927085256743
Impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation.	2.0564201811974954
Its problematic nature is unfolded on a report of two cases, one with a Küntscher nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail.	2.088201715656074
This event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively.	2.2631182464706394
The new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to jam against the cortex.	2.2468868348392665
Both, the slot of the unlocked reamed clover leaf nail and the wider dorsal flute of the solid titanium nail, realize certain therapeutic concepts.	1.7429811210244275
Primary intracranial germ cell tumors are rare neurological diseases.	2.49141991468909
Secreting germ cell tumors that predominantly appear in the pineal region are characterized by elevated levels of -HCG and AFP in CSF.	2.0851728270580043
Adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate.	2.5438327425976976
We present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of -HCG in CSF.	2.046539390690167
Six years before, a pineocytoma of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy.	2.103656971363361
This demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline-sized brain-tumors by evaluation of -HCG and AFP in CSF and serum.	2.2847778637210365
Today, different therapeutic strategies depending on the histological diagnosis are available and justify a high priority of a surgical tumor biopsy.	2.2935092883707684
However, the value of stereotaxic procedures remains controversial.	2.34499471994818
Recently published data gave evidence of a definite improved prognosis of secreting CNS germ cell tumors following combined treatment with high-dose polychemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation of the tumor area.	2.283108229987861
-HCG and AFP may serve as useful markers to enable follow-up of the disease.	2.374389781441501
In order to get a better data management of complications in orthopedic surgery and in order to get comparable statistics a standardisation of nomenclature and classification of complications is demanded since 1.1.1997.	2.0796609717164767
The Orthopedic University Clinic of Heidelberg started with a register of all early complications of all inpatients.	2.026949321629284
According to a standardized nomenclature all occured complications the doctors put in the data of complications in a database.	2.213819237512391
These data were controlled, complemented and classified by members of the quality menagement group.	2.211963884547315
The internet plays an important role in a growing number of medical applications.	2.6143225080120147
Finding relevant information is not always easy as the amount of available information on the Web is rising quickly.	2.4410786322477533
Even the best Search Engines can only collect links to a fraction of all existing Web pages.	1.9349812751918745
In addition, many of these indexed documents have been changed or deleted.	2.0133100784726587
The vast majority of information on the Web is not searchable with conventional methods.	2.170924960852652
New search strategies, technologies and standards are combined in Intelligent Search Agents (ISA) and Robots, which can retrieve desired information in a specific approach.	1.9050800878027316
With the availability of modern imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), diagnostic options in the evaluation of Marfan patients have been improved profoundly.	2.364451776887642
The most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall, immunofluorescence studies or pulse chase analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts, and molecular analysis at the cDNA/DNA level of the fibrillin-1 gene.	1.846722557850177
New diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised nosologic criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.	2.2912393220000697
The diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed: moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic Marfan syndrome are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence, gravidity as well as in the pre- and postoperative patient.	2.654118023808702
Primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias, dysostoses and dysplasias.	2.0033518501514167
Hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal.	2.3641513485247456
Generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy 21 and Ullrich-Turner syndrome.	1.7989896805370478
Dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis.	2.1092820099505625
Many of them are caused by mutations of single genes in the cascade of morphogenetic gene sequences.	2.1785460939719252
Dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue.	2.4690106415156396
Some of them (e. g. achondroplasia, Jansen type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia) are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation.	1.92235443508106
Others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components.	2.0986700446832742
Examples are collagenopathies such as osteogenesis imperfecta and some spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias.	1.9917892930001537
Finally, disorders such as pycnodysostosis, result from defects of chondro-osseous homeostasis.	1.9987040692037883
The study of skeletal defects helps to unravel the complexity of normal skeletal development.	2.0604119577054028
Human parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) and aplastic crisis.	1.9709908748706388
In pregnancy, B19 may be transmitted on to the fetus resulting in hydrops fetalis.	2.0909428293961394
B19 is sometimes associated with thrombocytopenia and vasculitis.	2.2875089303896523
In immunocompromised patients, B19 may persist causing chronic infection.	2.27774514563824
Several methods for detecting B19 virus or specific antibodies are now available.	2.1032759715129625
B19 infection does not usually require therapy.	2.4142133591637562
Efficacy of immunoglobulins in chronic B19 infection has been demonstrated.	2.567121075812621
In absence of significant symptoms and signs, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains difficult.	2.5883260399326837
Sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and ECG on their own is low.	2.303271595639279
Echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload.	2.1591351210360905
Venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected PE, but normal results do not rule out PE.	2.456281487483859
Helical CT with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli.	2.3833294854688987
However, if the CT findings are normal in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion, only larger pulmonary embolism are ruled out, and angiography with the focus on distal pulmonary vasculature should be performed.	2.11945470505882
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment, several diagnostic techniques, and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases.	2.1549183378270333
Heparin remains the standard therapy for patients with stable hemodynamics.	3.080367489208966
Thrombolytic therapy is recommended in hemodynamically compromised patients.	2.6003204858516487
In short-term dose regimes, the thrombolytic agents urokinase, streptokinase, and rt-PA seem to be equally efficient.	2.268551616859744
So far, however, no study has proven that thrombolytic therapy significantly reduces mortality in pulmonary embolism.	2.281700840322564
Background: Data on mesopic vision after LASIK are not available to date.	2.207290716804614
Renal tubular dysgenesis is a rarely recognized condition characterized by oligohydramnios, Potter's sequence and congenital anuria leading to stillbirth or neonatal death from respiratory failure.	1.7379813402471331
It is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.	2.387567381956259
Definitive diagnosis is based on renal histology, revealing the lack of proximal tubule differentiation.	2.567203962771724
Lectin and immunohistochemical studies confirmed structural and functional immaturity of the proximal tubule.	2.410323093715768
Further findings include bilateral renal vein thrombosis.	2.3193038405662363
The clinical and morphological parameters defining this disorder and the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed.	2.1197065033208995
Articular cartilage has only a small capacity for regneration.	2.417139982983793
This makes the repair of articular surfaces difficult.	2.451037909004369
In 1959 Pridie described his method of resurfacing osteoarthritic knee joints.	2.0397585822894517
This operation is still in widespread use today.	2.4070564874138562
Pridie introduced the principle of drilling exposed subchondral bone with the objective of encouraging a fibro-cartilaginous repair.	2.0352338068343205
The newly formed fibrocartilaginous layer that develops over the lesion in osteoarthritis may be enough to decrease patients symptoms.	1.955773266540529
Bone drilling into the subchondral layer is also effective in promoting healing of osteochondrosis dissecans.	2.0674753993366917
The choice of the treatment should be based on factors such as age of the patient, serverity of symptoms, activity level and functional demands on the joint, site and stage of the lesion.	2.681390756676719
The drilling operation remains useful in osteoathritis and osteochondrosis dissecans.	2.060507958831835
Recent immunobiological findings together with advances in biotechnology, ameliorations in clinical trial design, and MRI developments have led to a variety of therapeutical approaches in multiple sclerosis (MS).	2.076949747798642
However, in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments, a number of therapeutical failures exist as well: despite impressive data from animal models, convincing concepts, and promising phase I/II studies, some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials, or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects.	1.911243679294443
This article provides an overview of clinical studies that have failed or been abandoned for other reasons.	2.1574820664502496
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -antagonists which have led to negative effects in two studies (Lenercept, Infliximab) are discussed in detail.	2.097376780503162
These results raise critical questions concerning the hypothetical pathogenesis of MS lesions and the value of MRI in the assessment of clinically relevant therapeutic drug effects.	2.2165268552397763
Isolated pancreatic metastases from renal-cell carcinomas (RCC) are extremely rare.	2.3001841531351173
Only 96 cases of clinically diagnosed renal-cell carcinoma metastatic to the pancreas have been reported in the world literature, and 70 of the patients (including ours) underwent a definitive surgical resection.	2.3411093810402286
In many cases the time between the nephrectomy and diagnosis of metachronous metastases is reported to exceed 10 years.	2.071618084261864
Therefore, the initial diagnosis may be overlooked when there is a prolonged disease-free interval.	2.61700331143386
When it does occur simultaneously or metachronously, aggressive surgical resection, when possible, seems to be the most effective treatment for this metastatic lesion.	2.2677250887435583
Surgical resection can provide long-term survival in selected cases.	2.5846056269548185
We present the case of a 69-year-old woman in whom two pancreatic metastases were treated by a left-sided subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, 12 years after radical nephrectomy for a RCC.	2.1420509936118073
The patient simultaneously presented with both a mass in the body of the pancreas and a right-sided colon cancer.	2.286449112307248
Thus, the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer was suspected initially.	2.5691208154317224
Both tumors were radically resected, and histological examination revealed two pancreatic metastases from the previous RCC.	2.2465700030642544
In the world literature this report represents the eighth case of multiple pancreatic metastases due to RCC.	2.0562456062057297
It illustrates a rare indication of pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis.	2.206444048188623
The need for prolonged follow-up of patients is emphasized.	2.7669321978748056
The few reports on surgically treated pancreatic metastases from RCC are reviewed after the presentation of this case.	2.166919692887686
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively disconcerting convictions with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder.	1.7883996579917119
The perceptions from which delusions arise are dynamically charged according to their role in the structural context.	2.2875467315260662
The realisation pressure that burdens the perceptions and is intensified in psychotic constitutions is a precondition for the delusion.	1.8115733243579077
The failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic disorganisation of the structure is also a requirement.	2.1131044180551286
Based on a case study, considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification.	2.241526975447931
High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis.	2.469638040273246
The selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist, as the indication has to be carefully established.	2.407786880754253
Exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions.	2.2913420281335957
Prior to HDCT haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional-dose chemotherapy plus G- or GM-CSF stimulation.	2.0263099768937507
HDCT consists of a combination of carboplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide.	2.4508986383633022
After HDCT, haematologic monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential.	2.0957784147144647
It is therefore recommended that HDCT only be administered at specialized centres.	2.0188235094984996
Pyoderma gangrenosum develops in most patients between the age of 25 and 54 years.	2.493307819885436
It usually occurs in otherwise healthy persons or in association with a systemic desease.	2.3908202160968544
Extremely painful ulcerations are characteristic and evolve rapidly.	2.2316746060071737
Malignant pyoderma, the variant described in our case report, is an aggressive variant of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum, rapidly progressive and a potentially lethal ulcerative disease.	2.0272635766030795
The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum depends on recognition of the evolving clinical features because histopathologic changes are not specific and characteristically serological or hematological markers of the disease do not exist.	2.077663173680704
Histopathologic findings, however, always include vasculitis, either in form of the necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis (7), granulomatous (1) or lymphocytic vasculitis (2).	2.557245549758664
We report on a 36-year-old male patient, who underwent surgery for repair of an aneurysm of the aortic arch.	2.588436625924835
The aneurysm occurred two months after exacerbation of a malignant variant of pyoderma gangrenosum with nearly lethal exit.	2.171901769403021
An association of pyoderma gangrenosum with vasculitis has been described previously, but the present report is the first to describe an aortic arch aneurysm which seems to be associated with necrotizing angiitis of the vasa vasorum caused by a pyoderma gangrenosum.	2.3454107920049685
We could demonstrate successful perioperative treatment for prevention of exacerbation of pyoderma gangrenosum with prednisone and clofazimine	2.18283463176848
Background and purpose: To test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts.	2.037419756858385
Defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit.	2.257818012994835
For the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko-ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the primar loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency.	1.8401298009506655
The main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko-ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures.	2.2449629855625743
With a transpedicular screw-ringband-system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished.	1.918924686563652
After rigid instrumentation with a fixateur intern remained a residual range of motion due to which can result refuse to bending moments without spondylodesis in an implant failure.	1.9129153010907032
CT- or MRI-guided stereotactic procedures should be a standard in a modern neurosurgical unit.	2.2100608257563548
Analysing 71 cases the indications and results of stereotactic neurosurgery are presented.	2.39609241878979
In 53 patients stereotactic serial biopsies of different intraaxial lesions were performed, in 5 patients a spontaneous haemorrhage of the basal ganglia was removed by lysis with r-tPA.	1.9861991010090385
In 3 patients suffering from hydrocephalus due to diencephalic cysts a cystventricular shunt device was implanted.	2.0763822802101504
In 3 patients an intracerebral abscess was aspirated and drained.	2.145787581437406
A stereotactic guided craniotomy and excision of small deep-seated lesions was performed in 6 cases.	2.3861849830117317
The accuracy of stereotactic tumour biopsies was 88.7 % in our series, in accordance to other authors.	2.0825297887068612
The stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics.	2.0589600607848797
The stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal invasiveness and low operative risk.	2.4730079550791793
The aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r-tPA or urokinase.	1.8681190122223885
With stereotactic guidance small, deep-seated intraaxial lesions can be well localized and removed.	2.0892465872868957
Radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages (T1-T2).	2.494567068906231
In locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality.	2.074318440205374
Recent developments in linear accellerator technique, the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time.	1.8191849246131029
These improvements may possibly reduce the rate of therapy related side effects or complications significantly.	2.354008124590547
The combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone.	2.2951571094972976
In special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated.	2.4429363078929867
Future developments (i. e. intensity modulated radiotherapy - IMRT, combined thermo-radiotherapy, proton- or neutrontherapy) may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer.	2.1971233027368884
Skin is the second most common site of extranodal lymphoma.	2.2667124304547124
The significance of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years.	2.2813181791615667
Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas represent a heterogenous group of entities which show variation in histology, immunophenotype and in prognosis.	1.9962995866752589
The most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas, marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	1.954031408230237
The majority of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis.	2.259156540514121
Whereas in B-cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependant on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma.	2.437155748318819
It is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph-node-based counterparts.	1.9283560941936024
In the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas is discussed according to the WHO classification sheme.	2.1709799738997066
The phencyclidine derivative ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with the thalamo-neocortical projection system as the primary site of action.	1.9167630549684813
Racemic ketamine consists of the enantiomers S(+)-ketamine and R(-)-ketamine.	2.226593203156169
Racemic ketamine has never been considered an adequate anaesthetic agent in neurosurgical patients since  it produces regionally specific stimulation of cerebral metabolism (CMRO2) and increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP).	1.8424716006636632
However, recent experiments suggest that both tracemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine may reduce infarct size in animal models of incomplete cerebral ischaemia and brain injury.	1.9827214163831763
This experimental protective effect appears to be related to decreases in Ca++ influx and maintenance of brain tissue magnesium levels due to NMDA and quisqualate receptor blockade by ketamine.	1.9648667153658965
Studies in dogs have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) increases CBF in the presence of the cerebral vasodilator N2O.	2.298815147846897
In contrast, studies in rats without background anaesthesia showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p.).	1.9869043505520354
This suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	2.033973036455741
Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was maintained regardless of the baseline cerebrovascular resistance.	2.2433302513250926
There are several mechanisms by which racemic ketamine may increase CBF.	2.098947957842217
It induces dose-dependent respiratory depression with consequent mild hypercapnia in spontaneously ventilating subjects.	2.0333317401518487
This produces vasodilation due to the intact cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity.	2.615558556048308
Racemic ketamine also induces regional neuroexcitation, which leads to stimulation of cerebral glucose consumption in the limbic, extrapyramidal, auditory, and sensory-motor systems.	1.8364809984869572
This regional neuroexcitation with increased CMRO2 produces increases in CBF that can be blocked by infusion of barbiturates or benzodiazepines.	2.083721075577345
However, increases in CBF with racemic ketamine (1 mg/kg) may also occur during normocapnia and without changes in CMRO2.	2.3575193954976874
This effect is related to some additional direct cerebral vasodilating potency of racemic ketamine based on a mechanism involving blockade of Ca++ channels.	2.095009106022165
The effects of racemic ketamine on CBF autoregulation have not been investigated systematically.	2.2963486433304916
However, studies in rats have shown that CBF autoregulation was maintained with low- and high-dose S(+)-ketamine.	2.492362575467903
Infusion of racemic ketamine alters intracranial volume and ICP.	2.4328254477352744
Studies in spontaneously ventilating pigs with and without intracranial hypertension have shown that racemic ketamine (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) produces increases in PaCO2 and ICP.	2.1689825532295974
In contrast, identical experiments with mechanical ventilation and controlled PaCO2 showed no changes in ICP following racemic ketamine infusion.	1.9210996282501587
This implies that increases in ICP are related to inadequate ventilation with consecutive hypercapnia and increases in intracranial blood volume.	2.0050665545571134
However, mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to control ICP following racemic ketamine.	2.2875723491205178
Experiments in mechanically ventilated dogs indicate that racemic ketamine (2 mg/kg) increases cerebral blood volume and ICP even in the presence of normoventilation, a response that is reversible by hyperventilation or the administration of diazepam.	2.214544630119481
Studies in patients have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) reduces CBF in the presence of cerebral vasodilators like halothane or N2O.	2.2160264541868613
In contrast, studies in unanaesthetised humans showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (2-3 mg/kg).	2.218292514214386
This observation is consistent with animal studies and suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	1.9285833903897691
Dengue-Fever is a mosquito transmitted viral disease.	2.1620723013651126
It is endemic mainly in South-East Asia and Afrika.	2.0013830702258275
The clinical manifestation is divided into different stages.	2.372992339092162
Ocular manifestations in travellers have been rarely reported.	2.3079385110335853
Sufficient and regular wetting of the cornea with a normal preocular tear film is an essential requirement for the accurate visual functioning of the eye.	2.054112522007089
Measuring the break-up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary, clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability.	2.159739285700843
We designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break-up phenomena.	2.0551297736325678
The prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities in Hamburg (1985-1997) was investigated with respect to epidemiological, forensic and morphological aspects.	2.0643330684275227
The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities (drug deaths) in Hamburg from 1985 to 1997, (2) to assess the rate of multiple infections and (3) to analyze the liver histomorphology in 100 autopsied drug deaths.	2.284560107605859
Furthermore, we discuss the epidemiological and forensic aspects.	2.452352872295834
In this period 1469 drug deaths were registered with a prevalence for HBV of 35% (1997: 39%), for HCV 51% (1997: 58%), and for HIV 7% (1997: 15%).	2.0715545375041238
Co-infections were common (28%) and 19% of all cases were infected with HBV and HCV.	2.3223931263301645
The liver histology showed that hepatitis was frequently diagnosed (74%) and was associated with HBV and/or HCV infections (77% of all hepatitis cases).	2.1364957787352625
Only 9% showed a normal liverhistology.	2.5242214272869883
Forensic autopsies and monitoring of HBV, HCV and HIV infections in drug deaths represent an important tool to gain information about the individual case and the situation among i.v.	2.143691195828843
Background: An abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.	2.183944261913255
Our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina, only moderately elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (168 +/- 33 mg/dl), and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal (n=9) or slightly abnormal (n=9) coronary arteriograms (minimal disease with luminal irregularities and/or diameter reduction <=30%) before and after 6-month lipid-lowering therapy (simvastatin).	1.9636944311535833
Baseline data (mean +/- SD): 13 males, 5 females; mean age: 56 +/- 8 years; basal coronary flow: 90 +/- 22 ml/minx100 g; after lipid intervention: 93 +/- 18 ml/minx100 g (n.s.).	1.875512583121202
Total cholesterol decreased to 170 +/- 36 mg/dl (p<0.001); mean LDL level: 97 +/- 26 mg/dl (p<0.001).	2.134854932637317
Coronary dilator capacity increased, assessed in terms of minimal coronary resistance: 0.38 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.09 units at baseline (p<0.01), myocardial blood flow under dipyridamole: 232 +/- 43 vs 186 +/- 37 ml/minx100 g at baseline (p<0.01), and instantaneous flow ratio: 2.6 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.6 (p=0.06).	1.8414833169743623
Concomitantly, a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients.	2.4670580216759794
Consequently, aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and antianginal approach suggesting, at least in part, functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression.	1.8267704691715627
We report the case of a a 60 year-old worker in the pharmaceutical industry who suffered from recurring contact dermatitis.	2.282461382562886
Initially the contact dermatitis was limited to the hands; later on it became generalized.	2.169254252773143
The patient had been working on a drug filling line in a pharmaceutical plant for more than 20 years.	2.051331104551781
Eight years after starting this job he had developed allergic hand dermatitis to 2,6-diaminopyridine (patch test positive); this healed upon cessation of exposure.	1.8220274193820298
Ten years later he again developed hand dermatitis which progressed to generalized dermatitis and conjunctivitis.	1.9980963551848085
Under systemic and local therapy with corticosteroids and cessation of work, it healed nearly completly.	2.0984067685850527
Four months after returning to work, the patient experienced a first episode of severe asthma and generalized dermatitis with conjunctivitis following exposure to hydroxychloroquine the day before.	2.115824553785808
The asthma and dermatitis improved after systemic corticosteroid therapy and stopping work.	2.050830901057404
His condition continued to fluctuate, when though the patient was transferred at work and now wore rubber gloves.	2.073392653370949
Eight months later he again developed a generalized dermatitis.	2.3729732677046544
Patch testing revealed delayed-type sensitizations to hydroxychloroquine (tested in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 2%).	1.9707924224636646
Equivalent tests in five healthy volunteers were negative.	2.331782579433836
The patch test reactions were pustular, while a biopsy was interpreted as a multiform contact dermatitis reaction.	2.076887751592722
Bronchial exposure with hydroxychloroquine dust produced a delayed bronchial obstruction over the next 20 hours, which progressed to fever and generalized erythema (hematogenous contact dermatitis).	1.814469420017098
After removing exposure to 2,6-diaminopyridine and hydroxychloroquine, the patient went on to develop a contact dermatitis to latex (patch test positive).	2.128867528864302
However, skin prick tests with latex and patch tests with rubber additiva were negative.	1.9479340905950258
Hydroxychloroquine is well known to cause drug reactions.	2.777411361146251
To our knowledge, contact dermatitis to this substance has not yet been reported.	2.2231917156094316
It is noteworthy that the patch test reactions were pustular and of multiform morphology and that bronchial exposure to the allergen resulted in asthma and a generalized drug reaction.	1.79715906473456
Pathogenetically the asthmatic reaction seems to be on a delayed-type mechanism as is also seen with ampicillin, cobalt and nickel induced asthma.	2.082096331489095
A 45 years old female runner developed a bilateral tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon after repeated antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin.	2.036713211138566
MRI revealed degenerative changes of the left Achilles tendon; on the right side the tendon was ruptured with a dehiscence of 4 cm between both ends of the tendon.	2.419493134256298
The tendon was reconstructed surgically.	2.545617281447118
The histological analysis showed cystic changes with focal necrosis.	2.2345934129978535
After antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin the side effect of a tendon disorder must be considered.	2.368072843719518
The impairment of the tendon may be as strong that a tendon rupture may occur at daily living activities without any typical clinical symptoms.	2.1515274523948458
The recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors.	2.4196140058402786
Several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer.	3.176685165549599
In many cases, the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes is the predominant reason for cancerogenic cell transformation.	2.034402044288346
Functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations, resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the DNA.	2.527840389182647
As our understanding of the nature, function, and interaction of these genes evolves, new opportunities for early diagnosis, classification, prevention, and treatment of malignant tumors will arise.	2.3358078486592273
The present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes (erbB, ras, myc, raf, fos, jun, bcl, mdm 2, myb, kit CSF1R, met) and tumor suppressor genes (p 53, rb, mts) involved in lung-cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors, including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned.	1.9384311049399592
Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy is a kind of medical treatment in which a patient breathes 100% of oxygen inside a pressure chamber while the pressure of the chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure.	2.0363310370974106
For the clinical use of HBO therapy, according to international recommendations, there are several commonly accepted indications in which HBO either is the only causative life-saving kind of treatment, or is an essential and oftenly decisive component of a comprehensive interdisciplinary intensive care therapy.	2.0798677976056967
Among potential adverse effects, barotrauma of the lungs and especially oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system have to be mentioned.	2.524571125098907
Clinical use of HBO therefore requires special knowledge of its effects, risks, and adverse effects, a clear and distinct indication, and the ability and skills to keep complications under control by means of intensive care or emergency medical measures.	2.266295494210575
The clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen with its interdisciplinary-like character of emergency medicine or intensive care therapy therefore should be an additional, most interesting field of activity for the anaesthesiologist.	2.0895249132945293
Although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established, there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment.	2.372277149433697
In order to sytematically analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures, we assessed 196 consecutive ankle fractures immediately before ORIF.	1.9282551824626095
There were more cartilage lesions found than expected, and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type C-fractures than in type B-fractures.	2.1149494454295468
In both fracture types, an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group 1 to 3.	2.244555318641312
In addition, more ligament injuries were found than expected, especially in the B.1- and B.2-fractures.	2.2229261817817796
Successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in 26 cases: internal fixation, 9; loose body removal, 7; ligament reposition, 5; cartilage smoothening, 4; and cartilage fracture repair, 1.	2.091836321028924
In one case, a periostal flap could not be reduced, and in another case, the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable.	2.5473335586478734
In summary, arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures.	2.495491724847558
As long-term results are not yet available, it remains, however, unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following ORIF.	2.920110278509103
Arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures.	2.4927816080249614
Of these, percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication.	2.4646075626821546
Objective: Transcultural adaption of the two most widely used and accepted functional indices in ankylosing spondylitis, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Dougados Functional Index (D-FI).	1.8731798080176079
Methods: The instruments were translated and tested for internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC), construct validity (testing for association with Schober's test, finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, frequency and duration of awakenings at night, and a visual analog scale pain), and responsiveness (standardized response mean, SRM).	1.7586337750754681
Results: The study sample consisted of 72 patients of a randomized, controlled clinical trial receiving either Diclofenac or placebo.	2.1225924511620593
The limited responsiveness to Diclofenac treatment (SRM: 0.46 [BASFI],  0.33 [D-FI]) may be related to the selected study sample.	2.044270970576196
The BASFI was significantly correlated with all tested validation parameters.	2.280856048876122
The  D-FI was only significantly correlated with finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, and duration of awakenings at night.	1.9846899410945857
Conclusion: The transculturally adapted version of both functional indices are valid, reliable, and internally consistent.	1.8962647434298787
Because of psychometric advantages, the BASFI may be preferred in clinical trial settings.	2.149585495325742
The role of radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in patients with node positive prostate cancer remains uncertain.	2.482151577299093
Interpretation of the few prospective studies (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06) is hampered by severe flaws in the study design.	2.0200615412376552
Extension of the radiation to the paraaortal region shows no advantage over radiation of the pelvic lymphatics alone and is not warranted.	2.160383650033234
Data on longterm side-effects are only available from older studies with outdated radiation techniques.	2.1623978096085232
According to more recent studies short term side effects are considerably higher with radiation of the pelvic lymphatics when compared with radiation of the prostate alone.	2.257905108785282
In summary radiation of the lymphatic pathways in lymph node positive prostate cancer cannot currently be considered as standard treatment and should be carried out within clinical studies.	2.3335978942305586
In reconstruction of cartilage defects, autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method.	2.2750773559883326
Although a clinical application has not been reported until now, tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants.	2.1912689450695955
Nevertheless, in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms.	2.1500530673801133
Among other methods for in vivo tissue protection, the encapsulation with a semipermeable polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences.	1.9013203361095794
Human septal cartilage was encapsulated (group 1) with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of thymusaplastic nude mice.	1.9955354621880397
Cartilage implants without encapsulation (group 2) were used as control.	2.531361502988838
Scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after implantation.	2.264521250642383
Group 1 showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all.	2.295561884888327
In contrast, group 2 presented, correlating to the time of implanta-tion, increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation, representing an increased activity of resorption.	2.0193863719510787
In conclusion, tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences.	1.885064355332231
For the plastic-reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable.	2.0682574668378773
Subjective time-experience and objective time-estimation were examined in 20 endogenous, 20 neurotic depressives, and 15 healthy volunteers.	2.051979106869367
Subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls.	1.906177226967249
Objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives.	1.8110458117096913
There were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives.	2.1586947125069282
The perception of extended time normalized during treatment.	2.3032259607259022
The depressives' time perception, differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and - to a lesser degree - with retardation.	2.2090888514286613
The findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives.	1.9206600357246204
Amelioration of experienced time-extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of Lewinsohn.	1.8610487136940344
We investigated whether the free-to-total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ratio (f-PSA/t-PSA ratio; i. e. percentage of free PSA) represents a better discriminator for the detection of cancer of the prostate (CaP).	2.0800893414906114
In a retrospective analysis, the persentage of free PSA was determined in the sera of 35 patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 35 patients with clinically localized CaP.	2.0688420453227927
Patients with urolithiasis (n = 33) served as a control group.	2.2902785895748425
Serum levels of free PSA and total PSA were determined employing a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay.	2.1324518708497733
Patients with CaP demonstrated a lower percentage of free PSA (median: 8.7) than patients with BPH (median: 20.0; P < 0.001) and those with urolithiasis (median: 18.8; P < 0.001).	2.01456771713191
Determination of the percentage of free PSA enhances the differentiation between BPH and CaP and may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with an elevated PSA.	2.6479005101240576
Confirmation of our preliminary results is required.	2.5336270571157318
Psychological problems in children and parents related to children's atopic eczema (AE) may impede the success of treatment.	2.220230554129105
We studied the question, if behavior-based parental education in groups (DPE) or standardized video-education (VPE) could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin-damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers.	1.7992678669421582
Sevoflurane degrades in CO2 absorbents to produce compound A, which may have  hepatotoxic potential in humans.	2.206577021693929
Several recent studies in human volunteers have been performed to evaluate this potential.	2.473558814910821
Three studies have evaluated sevoflurane administered to volunteers using a 3% concentration for 8 h duration at approximately 2 L/min flow rate.	1.861152259499058
The initial investigation found high excretion of protein, glucose and renal tubular enzymes in the urine of the volunteers receiving sevoflurane.	1.9390839438268568
Subsequent investigations using identical protocols found more minor or absent changes in excretion of these markers.	1.9606269755145358
One additional investigation in volunteers studied 3% sevoflurane anesthesia for 4 h duration using a low-flow (1 L/min) technique.	2.300126789538106
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was observed.	2.0428306858884033
Application of these results to clinical practice must be interpreted in light of the experimental nature of the anesthetic administration.	2.397090659618332
Although some controversy remains, these data, combined with results of recent studies in surgical patients, suggest that renal function following modest duration low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia is similar to that following isoflurane anesthesia.	2.16603727582799
Background: The microbial colonization of the intestinal tract in newborns begins during delivery.	2.0754939356671724
Streptococci and Escherichia coli pave the way for the bifidobacterial dominance typical in breast-fed newborns.	1.955338322143007
They provide optimal living conditions for anaerobic bifidobacteria by withdrawal of intraluminal oxygen.	1.9749977643052135
A mixed intestinal flora is established on infant formula feeding in the infant.	2.049518551645053
Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and lactobacilli are the main genera of this mixed intestinal flora.	1.988426937106847
This represents an intermediate stage of the microflora in adults.	2.369708584236308
The bifidogenic effect of mothers' milk is based on the active substances it contains, which selectively enhance the growth of bifidobacteria, whereas other active substances suppress the growth of the accompanying flora.	2.134413866432669
Bifidus-enhancing factors in breast-feeding are lactose, oligosaccharides, glycoproteins such as glycomacropeptide and the inoculation with bifidobacteria deriving from the skin surface of the mother.	1.9619002428618353
Factors directed to the suppression of the accompanying microflora are antibodies, lactoferrin, lysozyme, fatty acids and monoglycerides that act as antimicrobial substances and the comparatively low protein and iron content in mothers' milk.	1.780903685627033
A bifidus-inhibiting colonization of the intestinal tract with pathogenic germs is caused by maternal birth-canal infections, which are now known to be the most frequent reason for premature births.	2.336398427018002
An increasing number of surgical deliveries, the separation of the newborn infant from its mother, and the generous use of antibiotics contribute to the delayed colonization of bifidobacteria and to the development of life-threatening nosocomial infections.	2.6616268986515355
Counteractive measures against this disastrous situation are the preferential use of bifidobacteria-preserving antibiotics and the inoculation of lyophilized bifidobacteria.	1.8702210327116113
Between January 1983 and December 1987, metatarsal head-resections were performed on 203 patients, comprising a total of 370 feet, using the Hueter/Mayo and Hoffmann procedure.	1.949606154056878
Seventy-two patients, comprising a total of 126 feet, were available for post-operative review after an average of 11.4 years from the date of the original operations.	2.3431501649057465
The information obtained from standardized questionnaires was compared to the information found in each patient's file.	2.3913037848996708
In addition, every available pre- and post-operative x-ray taken from 1983 to 1987 was analyzed.	2.127312054218922
Thus, with an average follow-up period of 5.6 years, the changes found in the pre- and post-operative x-rays from a total of 183 feet could be compared.	2.598699375021874
Before the operations, nearly 100% of the examined feet suffered from painful synovial hypertrophy and erosion of the metatarsophalangeal joints with dislocation and subluxation, causing approximately 70% of all patients to have great difficulties in walking.	1.893947458442528
After the operations, however, 90.2% of the patients reported that this condition had noticeably improved or had completely disappeared.	2.5407973516849776
In fact, 87.5% of all patients reported a lasting improvement in their ability to walk longer distances.	2.1731204307646146
As the main criteria in determining the success of an operation (namely, the noticeable reduction of pain and increased mobility) were achieved in 87.5% of the patients, we consider the metatarsal head-resection a reliable method of correcting forefoot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis.	2.2207966484831934
Bone metabolism is influenced by systemic and local acting hormons.	2.405477776982853
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) as representatives of the latter substances are known to have the ability for ectopic bone formation.	2.22112473359896
Within this study, we investigated the influence of different growth factors on the proliferation- and differentiation rate of osteoblast-like cells.	2.375463926550306
For that purpose, human osteoblast-like cells (HPOC) were incubated in the presence of either recombinant BMP-4 of the genome of xenopus laevis (rxBMP-4), recombinant human BMP 2 (rhBMP-2), transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) or basic fibroblast growth factor (rh-bFGF) in two different concentrations each (10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml).	1.9496231099129164
Cell proliferation was measured within a MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromid] assay, the amount of cell differentiation by the activity of alcaline phosphatase.	2.347666014669692
Rx-BMP-4 induced a differentiation of HPOC to almost the same extent as rhBMP-2, whereas the addition of rh-bFGF, applied at the same concentration, failed to have any influence on cell differentiation.	2.1160051746725497
However, rh-bFGF provoked an increase in cell proliferation when compared with unstimulated HPOC, while rhBMP-2 and rxBMP-4 showed no effect on proliferation.	2.132742899540045
TGF-ß influenced bone proliferation as well as differenciation significantly.	2.779553648224907
The equipotent effect of recombinant human BMP-2 and recombinant BMP-4 obtained from Xenopus laevis with regard to differentiation and proliferation of human primary osteoblast-like cells originates either in the fact that target cells have receptors for BMP 2 as well as BMP 4, or that both BMP's link to the same receptor with almost the same affinity.	2.0365030948511307
Sonography has provided an important addition to the tools available for the diagnosis of the soft tissues in the head and neck region.	2.714374891551276
The ENT surgeon himself is able to examine pathological formations by this quick, non-invasive and, last but not least, less expensive method.	2.1112547742640615
Due to the high resolution of the procedure the chance of detecting even small changes is increased and the exactness of diagnosis of pathological lymph nodes of the neck has been significantly improved compared to palpation alone.	2.024258075561976
Ultrasound has replaced the sialographic procedures in the field of diagnostic evaluation of salivary gland disease in the daily practice except for special indications.	2.413846498376913
After inauguration of color Doppler sonography non-invasive evaluation of vascular stenosis of the large cervical vessels concerning their hemodynamic effects has become possible.	2.1737434167680325
This issue is important for the differential dignosis of otoneurological diseases such as sudden hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus.	2.146030471944243
Additionally, the extent of perfusion of space-occupying lesions can be easily examined, and therefore the risk of mass bleeding can be preoperatively assessed by this method without harm to the patient.	2.2839782340183024
Especially carotid body tumors may be diagnosed with high accuracy by the evidence of significant diffuse perfusion of the lesion.	2.196748827875907
In several studies the specificity of the assessment of cervical lymph node disease could be increased by examination of resistance indices.	2.3973207805220786
However, other authors have shown inconsistent results in differentiation of benign and malignant lumps; therefore, final judgment does not seem to be possible yet.	2.0688406415796408
Use of echo-contrast agents to enhance the ultrasound signal seems to be a promising approach for future developments in color Doppler imaging.	2.1901619326997026
Painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill-defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat.	2.38473709856194
The nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder, adhesive capsulitis, focal algodystrophy, stiff shoulder, contracted shoulder, and others.	1.722629120732074
Apart from its idiopathic form, the disease can be initiated by trauma, infection, tumour, radiation, systemic and local metabolic disturbances.	2.1596476736739785
Pathoanatomically, the common denominator is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening, scarring, and retraction of the joint capsule.	1.9957816775396922
The inflammatory process often starts at the rotator interval and may extend to the subacromial space.	1.991883908048666
The prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not treated is unfavorable, with a reported 5-year survival of 0-18 %.	2.4304879303142766
Before the era of immunotherapy and in the absence of effective nonsurgical therapy, resection of metastases was the accepted way to prolong survival, giving a 5-year survival of 7-69 %.	2.250005073825364
Retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis.	2.6207214359309825
Some patients will benefit from resection of metastases, but most patients with metastatic RCC are not candidates for such aggressive surgery.	2.0938423655661693
The use of interleukin-2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions.	2.072301483432551
Without randomized trials, it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients, but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long-lasting remissions in selected patients.	2.2548621534584075
Many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit-to-risk ratio of immunotherapy, but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic RCC.	2.6763166622269914
The use of the reconstructive plate makes the operation easier.	2.2743980777089563
Shoulder fusion is especially suited if the function of elbow and hand is well preserved and if the patient is physically active.	2.310808034371579
But fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered.	2.088685487585861
The unreamed femoral nail (UFN) system, with its numerous proximal interlocking options, allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns.	2.1751486179744073
Sixty-six fractures, 5 cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures, 2 limb shortenings and 1 lengthening (monorail technique) and 3 cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the UFN from July 1994 to December 1996.	1.8325302218275261
The fractures were analysed according to the AO classification.	2.7658074678973477
We found 31 polytrauma patients with an mean ISS of 21.8 and a mean PTS of 25.4.	2.2386017362973054
Most of the multiply injured patients (n = 26) were stabilised with the UFN primarily.	2.1631887218098935
Follow-up of 44 patients ranged from 4 to 18 months postoperatively.	2.4035838583899123
According to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in 34 % of cases, good in 36.3 %, poor in 20.4 % and bad in 9 %.	2.321110414918783
Average fracture healing time was about 9.8 weeks.	2.385105514400617
Fractures of the atlas account for 1-2 % of all vertebral fractures.	2.4303115506103596
We divide atlas fractures into 5 groups: isolated fractures of the anterior arch of the atlas, isolated fractures of the posterior arch, combined fractures of the anterior and posterior arch (so-called Jefferson fractures), isolated fractures of the lateral mass and fractures of the transverse process.	2.5673849389503722
Isolated fractures of the anterior or posterior arch are benign and are treated conservatively with a soft collar until the neck pain has disappeared.	2.3154000924705116
Jefferson fractures are divided into stable and unstable fracture depending on the integrity of the transverse ligament.	2.4393843372735216
Stable Jefferson fractures are treated conservatively with good outcome while unstable Jefferson fractures are probably best treated operatively with a posterior atlanto-axial or occipito-axial stabilization and fusion.	1.937435127284377
The authors preferred treatment modality is the immediate open reduction of the dislocated lateral masses combined with a stabilization in the reduced position using a transarticular screw fixation C1/C2 according to Magerl.	1.9994339533060328
This has the advantage of saving the atlanto-occipital joints and offering an immediate stability which makes immobilization in an halo or Minerva cast superfluous.	1.8259670565349604
In late instabilities C1/2 with incongruency of the lateral masses occurring after primary conservative treatment, an occipito-cervical fusion is indicated.	2.0023335110028606
Isolated fractures of the lateral masses are very rare and may, if the lateral mass is totally destroyed, be a reason for an occipito-cervical fusion.	2.2546862999982182
Fractures of the transverse processes may be the cause for a thrombosis of the vertebral artery.	2.8381073402795045
No treatment is necessary for the fracture itself.	2.7873341791506707
Reported is the case of a 36-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery.	2.6084249466684013
Histologically and immunohistochemically, no hints on angiodysplasia as a possible cause of bleeding were detected.	2.109382291626141
Considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture, a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the neighbouring neurofibromatous proliferates was most probably the reason for bleeding.	2.611397305599755
We report on a 2-year-old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC).	2.218538133371589
Concomitantly with a feverish gastrointestinal infection caused by Salmonella enteritidis, the child presented with lesions resembling impetigo contagiosa on the legs and face.	1.834295621118125
Following antibiotic treatment with cephalosporins p.o.	2.312692185002767
she developed typical symptoms of CBDC, i.e.	2.3078006911568565
tense blisters on erythematous skin in the perineal area, on the flexor aspects of the thighs and upper arms and on the face.	2.364688256239533
Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone, confirming the diagnosis of CBDC.	2.1700542414858894
These lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p.o.	2.2945278911211937
This case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis, clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood.	2.4785863894313844
Systemic administration of strontium-89 is an important option for pain relief in advanced prostate carcinoma with multiple osseous metastases.	2.198215325893309
Recently, rhenium-186-HEDP was introduced as a new substance which has important advantages (shorter physical half-life, scintigraphic imaging, dose distribution).	1.8581407607047953
The myelosuppressive effect can be estimated more accurately in advance, so that adverse effects can be reduced and the treatment can be repeated after a shorter period of time and more often.	2.350877787552781
Our study comprises 15 treatments with rhenium-186-HEDP in advanced prostate cancer patients using the 1.4- to 2-fold standard dose.	1.9226210532503871
The response rate, estimated as reduction in pain and increase in patient mobility, was 87 % with no major myelosuppressive effects.	1.9566259694265895
All four patients with repeated therapy were also responding to the second treatment.	2.2868854759761845
Radionuclide therapy for painful osseous metastases with rhenium-186-HEDP appears to be an effective and, even at higher doses, safe procedure.	2.2047373633107146
Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat renal and central nervous system manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).	2.1088401957405023
Within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the standard therapy in severe SLE due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to oral application.	2.225847679288061
Studies on the slightly more cost-effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published, however, there are no data on long-term results yet.	2.5125607446605116
Here, we review the effects and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in SLE.	2.5484657618226927
Because of the possible side effects, especially the high risk of malignancies, which sharply increases at a cumulative dose of approximately 60g, cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously.	2.394814005779768
Cyclophosphamide bolus therapy should only be performed in hospitals with special experience.	2.555809920150345
The optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed.	2.547096934019464
Most authors prefer delayed surgery.	2.500414063750868
In this study the limit was set at 60 hours.	2.0736492470164425
Acute ACL reconstruction was performed in 39 patients and delayed surgery in 35 after they had regained full ROM.	2.3712855982208145
The incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44% lower in this population.	1.9905758814825123
When the indication is clear, we think that acute ACL reconstruction may be performed within 60 hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis.	2.1179028396283104
Nowadays, this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons.	2.4956829442639443
After some introductory remarks on the influence of psychosocial risk factors on the developmental outcome of premature infants this review summarizes the current knowledge about intervention programs for prematures and their parents with a special focus on parent-centered programs.	2.0653889934336362
Positive effects of intervention programs are found in an improvement of cognitive development, parental sensitivity and the home environment.	2.292823460817185
Only parent-centered interventions enhanced the quality of parent-infant interaction.	2.4323018109226213
It is questioned if those effects are also reliable for very premature infants and are found in the long term.	2.227410718474326
Further programs should focus on parent- and parent-infant centered interventions.	2.1644670734522964
Methodological problems of intervention studies and further research perspectives on parent-centered interventions are discussed.	2.0781342969881504
The surgical therapy of the rupture of a distal biceps tendon and a modified postoperative treatment is described.	2.3006079948840936
Mainpoint is the early treatment in anaclisis of Kleinert as it is standardized in the treatment of ruptures of the flexor tendons of the hand.	2.394495901745023
A forearm orthesis with a simply ROM-joint without reboundmechanism was used.	1.9802692824513735
Possible benefits are shown and further industrial evolution seems to be indicated.	2.5003425813197127
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP) are involved in important processes of tumor invasion and metastasis.	2.0314889613742584
In the study presented, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and 3 (MMP3), the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were measured by ELISA tests specific for these proteins in blood plasma.	2.0301861243792736
These components have been investigated in prostate cancer patients (PCa) with metastases (n = 18; T2, 3, 4 pN1, 2M1), prostate cancer patients without metastases (n = 29; T2, 3 pN0M0), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; n = 29) and in healthy men (n = 35).	2.0594151220283505
Mean values of MMP1 and of the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were not different among the four groups.	2.2286892702014334
The mean values of MMP3 and especially TIMP1 were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with controls, BPH patients and prostate cancer patients without metastases.	2.053200174211485
Ten of these 18 patients had TIMP1 levels higher than the upper reference limit.	2.231304941097622
TIMP1 concentrations correlate to the tumor stage but not to the tumor grade.	2.4192271419036535
These results indicate, that TIMP1 could be an potential marker for metastases in prostate cancer patients.	2.063075858968389
The interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach.	2.224217076901564
As in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device (ASDOS) is affected by late complications, particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations.	1.8510941185830685
The demonstration of 4 case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an ASDOS device.	2.1772264219314312
The diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation.	2.270265122429138
For early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after ASDOS implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about postinventional problems of this device is essential.	2.260452883379953
Every ASDOS patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography.	2.0289933102944904
The emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately.	2.0797167270977446
Furthermore, the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications.	2.0628190121766616
The goal of cardiocerebral resuscitation is to return to the pre-arrest level of neurological function and to reintegrate the patient into his former social circumstances.	1.91776917336225
This study evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in a country-area.	2.6828334046010065
The economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant.	2.558523949621449
Approximately 1 to 2% of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure.	2.3022991017967973
A great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long-term complications and productivity losses.	2.6235522830667013
In order to manage these costs, providers and policymakers increasingly have to focus on economicaly attractive interventions.	1.8503582365505362
Teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work-up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics.	2.593212234006252
Due to more complex therapeutic strategies and legally defined formal requirements, the need for teleconsultation will increase significantly in the future.	2.1689159233867517
Rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation (based upon an ISDN network in the beginning, later on by the use of a national health network).	1.9879501563440711
The medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery.	2.1881255597284692
However, the question of adequate financial compensation for this type of medical service is still unclear.	2.3006213489194285
All 459 surgeons and orthopedists in private practice in Berlin (approx.	2.1557661513337356
3.5 Million inhabitants) were contacted in March 1997 and asked to cooperate.	2.0659475878449136
An 18-point questionnaire was sent out to record the physician's experience with atraumatic and posttraumatic neck complaints, which was returned by only 112 (25%).	2.1138950776067125
According to their assessment these physicians treated ca.	2.200266993525525
47 000 atraumatic patients with cervical complaints and ca.	2.21516652315873
7800 with a history of a preceeding trauma over a 12-month-period (1996).	2.389190912365177
All responders had treated patients with posttraumatic complaints; about 60% stated having treated between 20 and 60 patients per year, 25% a smaller and 15% a greater number of patients.	2.0678230432622584
Half of the physicians stated having also treated patients with a cervical trauma not caused by another person (a total of 500 cases).	2.537752044350134
Symptoms/findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca.	2.1279871025928245
50% of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half.	2.7494386215497
It is noteworthy that the physician's point of view was influenced by personal accident experience (accident as a car passenger): 54% of the 26 physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be traumaspecific compared to only 35% of 40 physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms.	1.7341499121583914
The statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22% of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62% of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement.	2.0209464970967903
Of the physicians 32% were already familiar with personal cervical complaints in middle age unrelated to trauma and another 18% considered them sometimes a disease parameter.	1.794056167131119
The "subject physician" in the context of "whiplash injury" is not yet sufficiently investigated but seems to be an interesting topic of further research.	2.406078610397034
To measure dilation of large retinal branch vessels.	2.2366329069608275
Many of these colleagues saw their only way out as suicide.	2.068202896148299
Short biographies give an orientation about the destiny of the expelled physicians in their host countries.	1.9819497416808076
The effort made after 1945 to give these emigrated colleagues again an adaequate position in Germany have not been very intensive.	1.9174557462233335
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a diagnostic tool for special indications in oral and maxillofacial surgery.	2.3299099393652676
We describe a new MRI technique that presents images in a panoramic view analogous to orthopantomography.	1.8892786799914532
This technique is based on three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted sequences.	2.683212534858344
The familiar panoramic view in MRI provides better orientation and makes diagnosis faster and easier.	1.9376141469127863
However, the acquisition time is long (6-12 min per sequence), with a correspondingly high risk of motion artifacts.	2.3264342742952375
Moreover, the final workup is also time-consuming.	2.1697618025944676
These restrictions could be overcome by progress in hardware and software.	2.107631892935477
During recent years home ventilation has been shown to be useful for a growing number of patients with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency caused by weakness of the respiratory muscles.	2.624072590213218
Despite its technical simplicity, home ventilation leads to a number of social, ethical, medical and infrastructural problems.	2.326744686502508
This consensus paper discusses the special situation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in home ventilation and describes the current thinking in the following topics: (1) definition of home ventilation; (2) aims of home ventilation; (3) indications and preconditions of home ventilation; (4) techniques and forms of home ventilatory support; (5) preparation for and practical questions of home ventilation; (6) stopping home ventilation.	2.282004321844275
Pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by a massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction.	2.4782631663529173
It is rarely after hip surgery, however, untreated it may be complicated by a life threatening perforation of the colon.	2.4898175527784616
In a retrospective analysis we reviewed 11 patients (4 women, 7 men, mean age 75.2 years, range 67 to 86 years) with pseudo-obstruction of the colon after hip surgery in the years 1995 to 1998.	2.1411510625005183
In relation to all patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery of the hip, the prevalence was 1.06%.	2.5580440011862655
The leading clinical symptom was abdominal distension.	2.263440967033086
On plain x-rays, dilatation of the colon measured 13.3 cm on average (9-16 cm).	2.3113423784960982
In two patients (18%) adaequate application of drugs stimulating the gastro-intestinal motility was sufficient, whereas in 8 patients (73%) colonoscopic decompression had to be performed.	2.159613784320497
In three of these, the procedure failed and because of persistent symtoms a coecostomy was performed.	2.3599578966655996
One patient underwent immediate laparotomy because of peritonitis.	2.2563589546062404
2 patients (18%) died because of a complicated course.	2.702878953097661
Non operative treatment should not exceed 24 hours, endoscopic decompression and tube placement is considered as the treatment of choice.	2.3298700293052175
In cases of failure of these procedures, perforation of the colon and/or peritonism, urgent laparotomy with open decompression by a coecostomy is essential.	2.2239022721988406
Anti-semitism increased from year to year in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.	1.8818325973486008
The fear of annihilation resulted in a surge of suicides.	2.3945697700328874
The suicides of at least 9 Jewish dermatologists has been documented.	2.331125130897682
Their mean age was 65 years.	2.7034962518633403
Couples often committed suicide together.	2.529088666385364
At the end of World War II, the head of the dermatological department of the Prague University committed suicide.	2.147475266224841
We assume the same happened in Rostock and Dresden.	2.145397269182569
The president of the German Dermatological Society (DDG) committed suicide on March 27, 1945.	2.0313400641605375
The motives of these dermatologists were obviously the collapse of Nazism and the fear of relatiatory measures.	1.871780472866048
Biocoral is a biomaterial derived from natural corals, and it has surgical applications.	2.198826220895389
Since 1992 the author has been using this material as a bone graft substitute in maxillofacial surgery.	2.0274416905121644
Seventy-seven clinical implantations were done for different indications.	2.275818141730801
The results suggest that coral grafts are well tolerated and become partially ossified when the calcified skeleton is resorbed.	1.9347766808304214
This material has been demonstrated to be successful.	2.6935277246443516
Background: The aim of the study was the evaluation of how ophthalmological diagnoses and the proportion of multiply handicapped children has changed within the last 20 years at a state school for visually handicapped and blind children.	2.051290738639303
Introduction: Visual impairment as the initial symptom of leukemia is rare.	2.18602921772097
Although retinal involvement during leukemia is frequent, a leukemic macular lesion is an exception.	1.9979657332786585
Introduction: It was our aim to evaluate the results of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) with regard to recurrent hernias treated in our department.	2.4849274834425756
Methods: Included were 276 operations for first or subsequent recurrence of inguinal hernia previously treated with suture repair.	1.910350345580854
All final repairs were carried out using the TAPP technique.	2.3740398793347213
The data were collected prospectively.	2.679241760005909
The patients were examined 2 weeks and 1 year postoperatively.	2.559665501124384
The rate of follow-up amounted to 78.1 % at 1 year after operation.	2.42442073246684
The overall complication rate amounted to 9 %, major complications 5.3 %.	2.2128784848413043
The re-recurrence rate was 0.4 %.	2.5993818791452736
Conclusions: Because of the general advantages of laparoscopic surgery and the low recurrence rate we prefer laparoscopic hernioplasty using the TAPP technique.	2.30023446546411
Diseases of the hindfoot are associated with considerable functional impairment and therefore may hamper patients' movements during gait considerably.	2.1956093044248832
Because of biomechanical overload, articular structures, tendons and ligaments are prone to early degenerative changes during the course of rheumatic diseases as visible with plain film radiography, sonography (US), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	1.966972864807687
Findings may occur as arthritis of major joints or in the form of fibroostitis and bursitis of the os calcis.	2.362886428541713
Despite the progressive course of rheumatic diseases and characteristic imaging findings, high variability of X-ray signs may occur.	2.237517034637816
Plain film radiograms and high-resolution ultrasonography play a key role in imaging rheumatic diseases of the hindfoot.	2.442496315484188
MRI supports imaging diagnosis in selected cases.	2.3583091811283614
The principal goals of diagnostic imaging are precise and reproducible documentation of morphologic abnormalities and differentiated analysis for planning proper conservative or surgical treatment.	1.8827107625639783
Background: We evaluated the prevalence of the loss of visual acuity due to loss of the central portion of the visual field and foveolar fixation in the first week after glaucoma filtering surgery.	2.422897169980619
The aim of the present study was to test polylactic acid material as a controlled release carrier for polypeptide growth factors.	1.9749130710028153
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was incorporated into DL polylactic acid (PLA) pellets under hyperbaric CO2 pressure in two different ways.	1.8987879491656228
(1) Lyophilized bFGF was crushed and mixed with PLA granules, filled into cylindric moulds of 5 x 3 mm, and submitted to hyperbaric CO2 pressure.	1.8740550611141518
(2) Lyophilized bFGF was reconstituted in phosphate buffer, mixed with PLA granules, and relyophilized.	1.9449830585768748
In vitro assessment of bFGF release from the PLA implants by immunoassay showed that loading of PLA with crushed lyophilized bFGF resulted in a rapid and high release, while loading by solubilized bFGF and relyophilization led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor.	1.8472263525894559
Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children.	2.0605212902389236
In recent years this abnormality has also been observed in adults with chronic constipation.	2.2489821515411936
The aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease.	2.0587164356759082
The investigation was performed with 10 adults with IND, compared with 10 healthy control probands.	2.1973331551940825
The best diagnostic indicator of IND proved to be the detection of 6-10 giant ganglia with more than 7 nerve cells in 15 biopsy sections.	2.37397647448739
IND is an interesting cause of chronic constipation which can be histologically verified.	2.5351290233864545
Extracorporal shock-wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in the kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	2.162930774284564
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of soft-tissue disorders and tendinosis calcarea.	2.230800097678578
To date, the exact mechanism is unknown.	2.244806859312002
Local hyperemia following damage or afferent inhibition is discussed.	2.123943228340465
The possibilities and indications of ESWA with respect to several syndroms are presented.	2.3772321049419602
The results show the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of chronic soft-tissue disorders without severe side effects.	2.2948304299891276
Some patients showed small subcutaneous hematomas and erosion of the skin when energies about 20 mJ were used.	2.136401473280967
Forty-seven of 84 of the patients obtained complete relief; 24 patients showed a marked reduction in their complaints.	2.667630483760974
In only 13 of 84 cases was the treatment unsuccessful.	2.2018102140433866
Up to now there are no facts concerning the loosening rate of the cemented titanium stem (Trios).	2.043060531009479
The central guiding canula and the longitudinal drilled stem shall ensure a symmetric cement mantle.	1.8849925043961422
Management of laryngeal carcinoma located at the anterior commissure remains controversial.	2.3139565754354385
Local control rates with radiotherapy or surgery are not as good as those seen after treatment of midcord lesions.	2.042429388981726
The vertical partial laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction (VPLER) may be a more successful approach to such lesions.	2.1517551934136443
The charts of all patients treated for larynx carcinoma between 1991 and 1996 at the authors' institutions were reviewed to identify those patients treated with VPLER as described by Sedlacek in 1965, Kambic in 1976 and Tucker in 1979.	2.0050557642786817
Indications for performing surgery and outcome data of patients were collected and analyzed according to the indications for surgery, surgical technique, perioperative complications, oncological outcomes and functional results.	2.2561953137024897
Twelve patients were identified that had been treated with VPLER.	2.749977338902872
Indications for surgery included five patients with local recurrences following endoscopic laser partial laryngectomies, four cases with previously untreated primary tumors at the anterior commissure (T2 N0-2 M0), two with local recurrences following radiotherapy, and one with recurrence following frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	1.9361862031983808
There were no postoperative complications except for one laryngocutaneous fistula that required secondary repair.	1.8954060731246773
All patients were able to swallow at the tenth postoperative day.	2.2208199249514218
All had their tracheostomies closed after completion of wound healing, (a mean of 17 days after surgery).	2.3365977181301405
Phonatory results were usually poor.	2.6233287414365405
Two local recurrences occurred during the follow-up period.	2.6492553016678686
However, both patients were salvaged with total laryngectomies and have since been free from disease.	1.9634523827268568
All other patients are alive and well.	2.3316380034849176
Our findings show that VPLER is an effective surgical approach for carcinoma at the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately managed with transoral laser surgery or simple frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	1.969788319246555
This study demonstrates that the procedure can be successfully applied to the treatment of local recurrences following initial raditherapy or surgery.	2.6239455825843017
No major complications occurred in our study.	2.758902866134444
Traditionally, intra-vitam diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of brain supplying arteries is a domain of conventional selective angiography.	1.9376390344482015
We present a patient in whom color-coded duplex-sonography revealed a web-like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal FMD.	1.797782196081426
The relationship between depression and the outcome of low back surgery was investigated.	2.5732457871318677
Data analysis was based on two assumptions: (1) Presurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and, therefore, depression can be interpreted as a risk factor for surgical failure.	2.5252888597419
(2) Postsurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and therefore, depression can be interpreted as a response to treatment failure.	2.3468204334132023
The sample was made up of 78 patients who had undergone lumbar nucleotomy and 132 patients with lumbar spondylodesis.	2.1326595183468187
Treatment outcome was evaluated 6 months after surgery in the nucleotomy group and 9 months after surgery in the spondylodesis group.	2.401257807132355
Depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	2.0930020687384463
Measures of treatment outcome were an objective rating system for the surgical result, functional impairment, return to work, subjective estimations of the patient, and pain intensity.	2.3324691061936758
Presurgical depression scores showed no significant relationship with surgical outcome in nucleotomy patients.	2.267898344194602
In spondylodesis patients, however, there was a significant negative correlation with the patients' subjective outcome ratings.	3.0300066645004473
Postsurgical depression scores, on the other hand, were significantly related to almost all of the outcome variables in both treatment groups.	2.5105089625932635
Patients with clinically relevant postsurgical depression scores were significantly more likely not to benefit sufficiently from surgery than those with clinically not relevant depression scores.	1.8931623206227426
Our findings favour assumption 2 over assumption.	2.2362123736199244
In the light of our findings, depressiveness is interpreted as a response to a non-beneficial outcome of surgery.	2.2584566702410482
The need for an interdisciplinary approach combining psychological counseling or treatment and physical therapy for those patients who do not benefit from surgery is discussed.	2.183592785480017
Using electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) with short exposure times of 100 or 50 ms and the capability of acquiring up to 2 x 17 images/s it is possible to study most of the important morphological and functional determinants of the heart.	2.068440487642608
Various examples of studies in acute and chronic cardiac diseases are shown to demonstrate the use of EBCT to determine quantitatively left ventricular volumes (ml), myocardial mass (g), wall thickness changes over the cardiac cycle (mm/s), myocardial perfusion (ml/100 g/min) and the extent of coronary calcification (calcium score) and qualitatively the state of the proximal 4-6 cm of the subepicardial coronary arteries.	2.2662669225942795
The knowledge of these determinants seems very useful in excluding cardiac dysfunction, in the early recognition of cardiac disease and in the evaluation of the haemodynamic severity of coronary artery stenotic lesions.	2.7350494515186874
Further interdisciplinary studies are necessary to assess the clinical validity of these cardiac determinants, especially myocardial perfusion, using this advanced CT technology.	2.225219578822498
Fractures and dislocations of the elbow are some of the most common injuries in childhood and adolescence.	2.9328307132461484
The majority occur in sport and play activities, e. g., a fall from gymnastics apparatus or a bike, or from popular sports items, such as skateboards or in-line skates.	1.9607869039352417
The injuries can be divided into pure dislocations of the joint and fractures of the distal humerus, proximal radius and ulna, or combinations of both.	2.3882111202961918
In addition, extra- and intraarticular fracture types are defined, with the latter as partial or complete joint lesions.	2.1894394355398816
Dislocations of the elbow joint or the radial head can occur as single injuries or in combination with a fracture.	2.4849410801658243
Supracondylar fractures and avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle are the most frequent extraarticular lesions of the distal humerus.	3.2639273308052466
Fractures of the lateral condyle prevail is incomplete intraarticular lesions.	2.2719190190629446
In the forearm, radial head and neck fractures are predominant while typical and atypical Monteggia injuries have a special status.	2.1051312705564733
The complex joint construction and the age-dependent appearance of the epiphyseal ossification centers sometimes make a correct radiological diagnosis difficult.	2.126691971633045
The trauma history and an exact, clinical examination help to verify the injury, as do comparative X-ray studies of the uninjured side when necessary (but not routinely).	2.089871174586989
Unlike other anatomical areas, most elbow injuries - even in the growing skeleton - are treated operatively.	2.1272043743738367
Hereby, the growth plates have to be respected using minimal amounts of small implants.	2.4808687739475435
Additional immobilization in a cast for 2 - 4 weeks is necessary in most cases but does not lead to a functional deficit - in contrast to adults.	2.582095664852813
The implants should be removed as early as possible.	2.2011939163718126
Despite all therapeutic efforts, a significant number of late sequelae, such as malunions and functional impairment, can be seen.	2.5688904614374106
The rate of long-term complications increases in cases of untreated displacement of fragments or joint instability.	2.5116183744922758
Corrective measures are performed only in selected cases and after the growth plates are closed.	2.5223688158976487
Our own treatment regime is demonstrated using exemplary clinical cases of the different injuries and the results of a long-term follow-up study on sports injuries of the elbow in children.	2.727615895618867
Errors in diagnosis and therapy, as well as possible complications, are pointed out.	2.8206705567571593
2-adrenergic agonists, mimicking the action of the inhibitory transmitter norepinephrine, cause antinociception due to postsynaptic inhibition of spinothalamic projection neurons, presynaptic inhibition at the central nervous system termination of primary sensory nerves, presynaptic inhibition of brainstem noradrenergic neurons and a generalized decrease in central nervous system sympathetic efferent activity.	1.8022881013210814
There is a mutual potentiation of antinociceptive effects of clonidine and morphine.	2.0537166729072207
Clonidine is used in chronic pain states for treatment of neuropathic, neuralgic and deafferentiating pain.	2.498951362793768
Based on a meta-analysis of the studies published in the years 1996-1996, the therapeutic efficacy of systematically administered clonidine was evaluated in chronic pain states.	2.4490896428720945
Out of 403 screened published studies, only 9 fulfilled the selection criteria.	2.0294563654035893
Although three studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain scores, the improvement in pain relief in these cases was slight.	2.4105474878306388
Long-term treatment was successful in a few responders over a period of 17 months.	2.5129720877825203
Hyperalgesia caused by sympathetically maintained pain was relieved by topical (transdermal) application of clonidine.	1.985528085478354
Based on this evaluation a grade C recommendation is derived, which relates to responders.	1.929231953506119
Successful treatment is expected only in pain states with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.	2.186032441722263
Therefore, in chronic pain, treatment with systemic clonidine is of no significant value.	2.313441219568275
Study objective: To investigate whether automatic tube compensation (ATC) or conventional pressure support (PS) is suit- able to compensate for the work of breathing imposed by the breathing circuit without altering the breathing pattern.	1.855547431548592
DNA-based prenatal testing of the fetal genotype was performed in a family at risk for recurrence of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).	2.1775382325666395
DNA from cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from the peripheral blood of the previously affected offspring, DNA from parental leukocytes and DNA from fetal tissue obtained by chorionic villus biopsy was analysed by direct PCR amplification of known polymorphic regions within or flanking the type VII collagen gene, the canditate gene in RDEB.	1.6698742795883799
One flanking marker (D3S2/MspI) as well as two intragenic polymorphisms (C7/MspI, C7/Eco0109I) in exons 30 and 84 were informative in this family.	1.853310469693179
Thus, based on the haplotype analysis and the lack of evidence for locus heterogeneity in RDEB, a phenotypically healthy child was predicted.	2.2711925965744775
This prediction was confirmed by the birth of a healthy female infant.	2.3966059905647947
The study reports successful determination of the fetal genotype by PCR-based prenatal diagnosis in a family at risk for recurrence of severe RDEB.	2.2088057372469296
Endothelins are peptides with powerful vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties.	2.1456594647536518
It has become evident that endothelins are involved in many regulatory mechanisms of the circulation role both in short and in long term.	2.0645982600423656
The synthesis of endothelin receptor antagonists and animal models with altered endothelin metabolism have opened a new era of endothelin research that will allow insight into the mechanisms of endothelin-action and eventually might lead to new therapeutic concepts.	1.8092680997831871
This review discusses the evidence both in favor and against pathogenic effects of endothelins in cardiovascular disease.	1.9251905195760268
The combination of fast MR sequences and rapid i. v. injection of paramagnetic contrast media provides information on cerebral perfusion.	1.966197114029857
MR-perfusion imaging primarily depicts the relative cerebral blood volume.	2.2621073768897544
The aim of this study was to test whether MR-perfusion imaging with a clinical MR scanner using a standard 2D-FLASH sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors.	1.8761553778466409
Brain infarctions, lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls.	1.9158149275570278
However, our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method, which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow.	2.2786574900902017
Lumbar Microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach.	2.0870073440508805
The microscope is the best surgical aid.	2.6005813976511267
Alternatives are a retractorintigrated light or headlamp.	2.319110104672368
A specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy - the wrong level - can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning.	2.09069993301041
Other complications like dural lesions and exessive bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view.	2.211311023266947
The most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation, major vessel or visceral injury, can be avoided by lusing the new rongeur with a depth guard.	1.9392084644254222
From January 1987 to March 1994 three hospitals in the city of Magdeburg treated a total of 103 subcutaneous Achilles tendon ruptures operatively.	2.068252853373229
We created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used.	2.865183995122387
Important aspects of the follow-up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a KIN-TREX dynamic measuring device and the clinical check-up in comparison with the histological results and the patients' history.	2.483898486992043
Degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38,8 % of the cases.	2.551022926632622
The average score of all OP methods applied was 767 of possible 1000 points.	1.9563118195270652
The adaptation suture (781 points), Silfverskiold's technique (772 points) and the fibrin adhesive technique (754 points) showed approximately the same results.	2.0394655180499877
The theory that all of the ruptures have a histological degeneration background seems to be wrong.	2.4852462395139625
Isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load.	2.147193992458064
To determine wether a somatic dysfunction of head joints depends from segmental muscle strain, we investigated 89 patients before, during and after general anesthesia.	1.9896434359413964
We examined the disturbed joint motion as exclusive criterion for a somatic dysfunction, because through an anesthesia with endotracheal intubation including complete neuromuscular blockade segmental influences on the inspected joint were eleminated.	1.7833757802582337
For complete muscle relaxation as required for orotracheal intubation a non depolarizising muscle relaxant was used.	2.0001002799413365
Somatic dysfunctions were found most frequent for side-inclination and retroflexion in segment O/C1.	1.9114538592284152
Both before as well as during complete neuromuscular blockade could be found in the majority of examinations (89,1 %) similar restraints of joint motions.	2.612239908163848
To 10,9 % were found, that somatic dysfunctions established before the muscle relaxant was applicated, were no more demonstrable under complete blockade of neuromuscular transmission.	1.9362572278976002
Different theoretical models are presented for the interpretation of our results.	2.6298157581432067
We assume, that the disturbance of one component of the metamer organized segment is the basic phänomenon of somatic dysfunction.	2.135062332989267
This disturbance break through the spinal segmental inhibition and expand into the segment.	2.07655430535741
Subsequently we discuss to replace the term "somatic dysfunction" through "segmental dysfunction" and to define it as increasing of nozizeptive afference in the segment over a determined period of time with breakthrough of the spinal segmental inhibition threshold.	1.8955687665989953
Postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra-abdominal operations.	2.290181522061186
The postoperative delay of bowel movement, however, is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used.	2.5905544784500267
In order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic-induced postoperative delay of bowel movement, two types of intravenous-based anaesthesia using fentanyl/midazolam (1 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h), and ketamine/midazolam (250 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h) respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique (enflurane; mean concentration 1.5 vol%).	1.949823164198512
In three groups of patients (each n=15) undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities, induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital (1 - 1.5 mg) followed by succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) to facilitate intubation.	2.35376883790361
For the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium bromide was used.	2.2704476226320067
All patients were given droperidol to prevent postoperative emesis, and they were artifically ventilated with N2O/O2 (60: 40) to normal end-expiratory CO2 concentrations.	1.9569015892512582
No anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility.	2.4296715094096966
In order to determine gastro-intestinal motility, the H2 exhalation test was used.	2.135481978763612
Lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it enters the colon, and H2 is released, taken up by the vascular system and exhaled.	1.8960916776790577
Postoperatively, patients were asked to exhale into a 20-ml syringe every 10 min.	2.1359624948668454
The content was analysed for hydrogen (ppm), using an electrochemical sensor (GMI exhaled hydrogen monitor).	1.8798518378531726
From the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration (compared to the preoperative value), gastro-coecal transit time was computed.	2.075893169101313
All three groups of patients were comparable in age, height and body weight.	2.560280356738127
Also, the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups.	2.8181875764492803
Mean gastro-coecal transit time was 204 ( +/- 19.6 SD) min following enflurane, 302 ( +/- 32.8 SD) min following fentanyl/-midazolam and 210 ( +/- 28.8 SD) min following ketamine/midazolam anaesthesia.	1.857051872660022
The gastro-intestinal inhibition after the opioid-based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test).	2.044949633935293
There was no significance between patients after ketamine-based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic.	2.080837418788369
When using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid, gastro-intestinal inhibition, especially in patients prone to have constipation, is likely to develop postoperatively.	2.184483807350045
In classical neuroleptanaesthesia and in analgosedation in the ICU, the simultaneous use of the butyrophenone droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid-related gastrointestinal motility.	2.073022505981557
In cases of opioid-related gastrointestinal atonia a gastrokinetic compound may be necessary to overcome this effect on intestinal motility.	1.9344195826405237
In a prospective study 20 patients were monitored with serial sonograms and radiographs during distraction osteogenesis at the lower limb.	1.9725533294533548
All sonograms were obtained in four planes using a 7.5 MHz transducer.	2.2049767881258853
The distraction gap was seen as a sonolucent area in all patients after corticotomy.	2.468658605631801
At an average of 20.7 (14-28) days after the beginning of the distraction, echogenic foci occurred and showed increasing longitudinal alignment with further distraction.	2.1344140578638005
Radiographical signs of beginning mineralization were seen an average of 48.3 days after the start of the distraction.	2.495831971977622
Exact measurement of the distraction gap was possible in all patients during lengthening.	2.899206687337144
Bone healing complications and hematoma could be detected by ultrasound.	2.5171591592003004
A rapid increase of bone mineralization was seen after the distraction was stopped.	2.2199739314755513
With increasing cortication of the regenerate bone, sonograms showed a hyper-reflecting solid line so that further mineralization and the time of removal of the fixator could not be assessed by ultrasound.	2.2124586665802113
The interval between the onset of symptoms in patients with head and neck cancers and the introduction of treatment was evaluated.	2.9791148697997007
During a 1-year period, patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor.	2.6710137304911847
Also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ENT specialist and actual referral to our department.	1.9806016919363476
We then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy.	2.41416491696651
It was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter (median, 8 weeks) than that of patients who first went to their family doctors (median, 13 weeks) (P<0.02).	2.187871963375449
The latter then took an additional 4 weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist.	2.0734715099465943
Referral from the ENT specialist to our department took another 2 weeks, as well as our staging and pre-therapeutic management.	2.4397031347823357
Our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy.	2.382744389746768
Tumor patients with greater professional qualification went to their doctors earlier (P<0.0001) or more often went directly to an ENT specialist (P<0.002).	1.911743510577785
Consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays.	2.125491100124312
The present study deals with long-term dimensional changes in cemented Müller-type total hip endoprostheses.	2.2799075804259603
Creep and wear contribute to different extents to the dimensional changes in polyethylene.	2.0760605700574915
The total amount of polyethylene wear is represented by the displacement of the femoral head into the socket.	2.2630914940811633
Within the first postoperative years, the head shifts up to a relatively high rate of about 0.5 mm per year.	2.672105776017278
This rate diminishes after 5 years to an average of about 0.1 mm (ceramics) and 0.2 mm (metal) per year.	2.062991418196723
Values exceeding 0.2 mm per year for the shift of the femoral head are considered to be unfavourable with regard to a probable loosening of the prosthesis.	2.4181815502098565
In this study we determined the orientation of the centre of the prosthetic head in relation to the wire marker of the polyethylene cup, comprising in all 369 total hip prostheses.	1.9286614443358698
After an average of 77 months, 96 % of the prostheses with ceramic heads (n = 109) had a wear rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.	2.1311920218245497
Using metal heads (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) this rate could only be measured in 71 % (n = 109) of the prostheses (61.5 months).	2.232993782492799
The combination ceramics-polyethylene produces half of the total amount of wear produced by metal-polyethylene.	2.1625203303830567
Younger patients should preferably be treated with a ceramic ballhead.	2.612729293567097
The so-called amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare variant of dermatomyositis which has attracted increasing interest during the last years.	2.483727921979105
Crucial for the diagnosis is the exclusion of myositis by clinical examination, EMG and histology.	2.6318369714125223
Furthermore, longterm supervision of patients is advisable in order not to miss the appearance of early signs of myositis.	2.1556258573633413
The longest reported follow-up of amyopathic dermatomyositis patient is 4 years; however, it cannot be excluded that these cases will eventually culminate in classical dermatomyositis.	2.143738374707746
In this paper we describe two cases and discuss the differential diagnosis and therapy; also, the term "Premyopathic dermatomyositis" is proposed, to indicate that the full picture is to be expected in most cases.	2.2620692297831684
The primary renal angiosarcoma is a rarely seen highly malignant tumor.	2.2083274151616177
Making a diagnosis based on histology may prove difficult.	2.3852056934739716
Because of hematogenous formation of metastases and bad prognosis in most cases we recommend that the surgical intervention be followed by the well tolerated systemic chemotherapy with Doxorubicin and Ifosfamid.	2.2498449819525748
This study compares the results of the outpatient-based program of the Cochlear Implant Center Ruhr with inpatient-based rehabilitation, which is almost exclusively performed in Germany.	2.1431025096758978
The Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Essen in Germany provided 52 patients with either 22- or 24-channel Nucleus cochlear implants from March 1996 to July 1999.	1.9471809719917097
Almost all patients (n=49) were rehabilitated on an outpatient basis, which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside Germany.	2.3656371730807346
Syringe drivers are used in anaesthetics, intensive care and emergency medicine to deliver small volumes of highly potent drugs with continuous, constant and reproducible flow.	1.9533177089885465
For early recognition of interruptions of the drug delivery caused by occlusion of the infusion system, an alarm is triggered as soon as the system pressure exceeds a certain limit.	2.138362914395056
The sensitivity of this alarm depends on the flow rate, type-specific cut-off pressure and the elastic parameters of the infusion system.	2.342258180823199
The sudden release of pressure built up in the system after occlusion occurred can cause delivery of an uncontrolled drug bolus and hence an additional hazard.	1.9278726900924257
Methods: Six syringe drivers that are widely used in clinical practice were tested for alarm delay and bolus delivery in the event of an occlusion in the system.	2.1201874674408145
First, the alarm pressures at flow rates of 10, 50 and 100 ml/h were measured.	2.002373680096745
Then the alarm delay time and bolus volumes post-occlusion were assessed, using a basic infusion system (syringe+single infusion set).	1.9473524381904501
Finally, several alterations to the system like extension, tap battery with germ filters or branching were made and their impact on alarm delay and bolus volume measured.	1.8099195228038731
Results: Because of the great differences in alarm pressures between the devices tested, there were marked differences in the alarm delay at same flow rates.	2.3598319675617616
Predictably, there was an indirect proportional link between alarm delay and flow rate.	2.5181644872901354
Using the basic infusion system, alarm delays between 23 s and 143 min were measured.	1.9618515322362144
In the other devices, release of the pressure in the occluded system caused boli of 0.5-7 ml.	2.1370192515754
Tap batteries, parallel running syringe drivers or trapped air in the system, however, caused marked increase in both alarm delay (107%) and bolus volume (+147%).	2.0282079778046227
Discussion: Unidentified occlusions of the system cause grave malfunctioning of syringe drivers.	2.2443301849929136
While applying highly potent drugs, the discontinuation of drug delivery with subsequent bolus application can cause vital danger to the patient.	1.9329804967289
As a result of the significant time delays in the pressure alarms, the devices tested do not provide sufficient protection against unrecognized system occlusion.	1.923238683779715
Syringe drivers with adjustable alarm pressure can be set close to the actual infusion pressure.	2.154535794129636
A further important point is that one should aim at a reduction in the elastic properties of the infusion set because of the great impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	2.3281844071375093
Because the overall results of conservative treatment for distal radial fractures have been unsatisfactory, it is rarely used.	2.4862360339396794
However, minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous K-wire pinning are being increasingly used.	2.11260438088802
A justified indication for the use of K-wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short- and long-term anatomic and functional results.	2.468658949799303
Short-term supplementary immobilization with a minimized plaster cast or protective external fixation is generally considered to be useful.	2.274462717362645
Reports on plaster-free functional treatment after K-wire pinning have been published.	2.158139976229579
The indications therefore need to be further specified.	2.534884270992938
Follow-up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in K-wire stabilization and good-to-very good results in 75% of the cases.	2.5727273649169535
Involvment of the genitouronary tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare.	2.144871436026646
Rapid proliferating Burkitt's lymphomas could mimic acute diseases.	2.156026478126338
Due to the extreme chemosensitivity, the lymphoma is cureable and surgery should be done only for histology.	2.0769358148902493
Initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease.	2.2513685486422474
In any case a multiagent chemotherapy is necessary.	2.236992497270358
Wet autoclaving is a simple, reliable and time-effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed archival material.	2.103772112943167
Both routine diagnostic (e. g., oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cytoskeletal proteins) and research antibodies (e. g. various p53 antibodies, mdm-2, bcl-2, MIB-1) are reported to demonstrate its application.	2.1549800824385685
Wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin-embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections.	1.9564400541347167
Classical stable plate osteosynthesis with its anatomical repositioning, absolute stability between fragments and medial support should only be applied to joint fractures and spongy bone.	1.958616754508367
In cortical bone, the anatomical reposition connected with the plate promotes bone necrosis along the fracture and prevents callus formation.	2.0890148061803866
Direct cortical synthesis, a method also known as "primary bone healing", serves the bone's revascularisation and is not necessarily aimed at healing.	2.066438417458658
Along the shaft of long bones, elastic plate osteosynthesis, a biological method, is safer than and superior to the rigid technique.	2.0509208065503897
This even applies to short oblique and transverse fractures insofar as nailing does not appear feasible.	1.9147356942088514
Elasticity is achieved by leaving a flexible stretch of at least 2 - 4 holes, i.e.	2.3459049145239947
as long as possible, without screws over the fracture and by employing a titanium plate.	2.3823314555104305
Thus, there is no punctate fatigue leading to plate breakage.	2.435264637673811
The fitting of third fragments is deliberately left out.	2.1265438542987782
The same applies to all kinds of compression with lag screws, tension devices or DC-gliding holes - and this with the intention of allowing micromovements in the fracture's fissure.	1.7717630377061728
Periost and muscle are not removed and the fracture is not examined.	2.325778527356396
Healing occurs spontaneously via a fixating callus forming within the first 3 - 6 weeks out of the periost-soft tissue combination.	2.2284836394260736
Histomorphological investigation dates the first woven- bone bridges between the fragments to 3 weeks subsequent to the accident.	1.9847313221037544
In Göttingen University trauma centre, 87 fractures have been attended to over 2 years using this technique.	2.029780593930492
Despite considerable soft-tissue damage, no delayed bone healing, pseudoarthrosis or bone infection has been observed.	2.2220363929624876
The risks of elastic plate osteosynthesis lie in unbiological and exaggerated reposition methods, too short a flexible stretch, and insufficient anchorage of the screws.	1.8349814601519396
Diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100% certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography.	2.0206058548297414
A correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner.	2.562614657490823
Both methods are available throughout Germany.	2.4598176227309465
Although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations, duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive.	2.5344733650952604
Phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified.	2.2297058097104028
This applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered, if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined.	2.0588636691860183
Discrepancy between clinical findings and the results of duplex sonography also constitutes an important indication for phlebography.	2.52496750858883
For frequent ventricular ectopic beats, currently, reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the mainstays of treatment.	2.053539147035929
This study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients.	2.008369166017154
Catheter ablation was performed in 65 patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats.	2.503135053192752
In 5 patients a new non-contact mapping was additionally performed.	2.0869800388544157
The ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in 37 and in the left ventricle in 28 patients.	2.727904050247578
Ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49/65 patients (75%).	2.070810643543133
During a mean follow up of 13 +/- 11 months, 9 of 49 successful ablated patients (18%) had a recurrence.	2.3155301343862784
Radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity.	2.242577038730444
It may, therefore, be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic, drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity.	2.473855845624375
After healing of bone and soft tissue damage, posttraumatic metatarsalgia can persist.	2.610956044968782
The paper presents a therapy algorithm with newly designed insoles, which consist of the common orthopaedic adaptions like a rocker bottom and a stiffening of the sole.	1.827112063758675
The therapy is shown on two cases.	2.543984541031391
With these orthotics adequate is possible and pain relief realistic.	2.3661644043545116
Background: Myopic PRK up to 6 D is an approved and safe procedure.	2.183444908010532
The efficacy and safety of combined treatment of myopia and astigmatism in compound myopic astigmatism (PARK) have not yet been demonstrated.	2.1851303438917298
Nitric oxide (NO) can play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission, as well as in non-specific immunoreactions and inflammation in a variety of tissues.	2.5478699477130498
Increased quantities of nitric oxide in respired air can be measured during inflammatory processes.	2.245912746939925
However, the exact role and precise sources of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions within the airways remain to be defined.	2.0009852414572418
We report on a 55-year old patient who presented with a four month history of intermittent left thoracic painful attacks which radiated in the left arm.	2.3813714938295547
Both normal 12 lead electrocardiogram and treadmill stress tests showed no significant ST changes.	2.0986813588415236
A thallium-201 scintigraphy afterwards disclosed a non-transmural septal ischemia.	2.248115378732107
The consecutively performed diagnostic catheterization revealed a severe, almost pouch-like proximal aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a maximal diameter of 15-20 mm as well as an aneurysmatic modified left coronary artery and an impaired left ventricular function (EF 49%).	2.2094317844729305
In the absence of coronary artery stenosis, the patient was treated conservatively with an ACE inhibitor (lisinoprile 20 mg/day) under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with coumadin.	2.531673980677083
With this strategy the patient has been asymptomtic during the eight month follow-up period.	2.235437541624508
We investigated in 17 children (mean 7.1 years) the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation cystoplasty or exstrophy reconstruction.	1.9741251779404485
Mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3.8  +/-  1.1 days (initial dosage 0.25 mg/kg/per hour, dose adjustment by the nursing staff).	2.151042093211608
Mean tramadol consumption was 0.21 mg/kg/h on day 1 and was reduced to 0.08 mg/kg/per hour on day 4.	2.3482951339208777
Median pain score (assessed with ten-step scales) was 5 before treatment and between 2.5 (day 1) and 0.5 (day 5) during therapy.	1.932217768098154
Lowest oxygen saturations (mean) ranged from 93.8 % to 95.2 %.	2.0533747241373774
Three patients (17.6 %) suffered from nausea/vomiting on 3 of 64 treatment days (4.7 %).	1.903478828953667
Pruritus and extreme sedation did not occur.	2.2815653206453157
The continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children.	2.232768983535324
Over the past 5-7 years, there has been a renewed research interest into the mechanism as well as the development of newer "emerging" treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation.	2.594713988055145
One of these novel therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator.	2.158286202100748
In this article we will review the basic and clinical research which has been used in the development of electrode systems and shock waveforms utilized by commercially-available implantable atrial cardioversion devices.	2.1766220703774293
In 26 patients with abscesses in the maxillofacial area, the electrolyte concentrations, pH and osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of the pus fluid were measured and calculated.	1.88472974562854
The main cations identified were sodium (134  +/-  38 mmol/l) and potassium  (37  +/-  16 mmol/l) and as anions chloride (183  +/-  46 mmol/l) and bicarbonate (10  +/-  4 mmol/l).	1.936925309138857
The pH value of the pus liquid was 6.164  +/-  0.233.	2.2595399541379266
The calculated mean osmotic pressure of the pus liquid was 7910  +/-  1455 mm Hg, whereas the measured physical pressure inside the abscess was 49  +/-  13 mm Hg.	1.9173090322680117
Both pressure types show time-dependent pressure curves.	2.360217392062541
With time, the real pressure inside the abscess cavity increases, whereas the osmotic pressure decreases.	2.2692575859392843
There was no relationship between the two pressure types and the different species of microorganisms responsible for the inflammation.	2.450981169882215
The results of the study reveal that abscesses can be regarded as osmotically active systems, and the mechanism by which the abscess is formed might be as follows.	2.403637614576599
After penetration of virulent microorganisms into the tissue space, the area of acute inflammation is walled off by the collection of inflammatory cells.	2.0815506976308
Destruction of tissue by products of the polymorphonuclear leucozytes takes place and results in liquefactive necrosis and a hypertonic abscess cavity.	1.9321687135871086
The inwards-directed flow of tissue fluids into the cavity via the abscess membrane causes volume expansion and generates pressure, two facts that can explain the swelling dynamics and typical symptoms of abscesses in the maxillofacial area.	1.73550176123641
Internal mammary artery (IMA) bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium.	1.9773837573803534
Their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia.	2.1355957724398578
This study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the IMA graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia.	2.390104178940241
Twenty-five patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the IMA as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries.	2.073828419952797
Distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood-cardioplegic  arrest.	2.0386400082580876
After unclamping the aorta and IMA graft, the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion.	1.9605445748477643
A sufficient IMA graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature: The cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course, respectively.	1.8095365022739476
The rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side, and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side.	2.13708095771455
An insufficient IMA graft function could be recognized by atypical temperature courses.	2.1446131224735003
Fabry's disease (Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum) is a rare X-chromosome linked recessive disorder belonging to the group of sphingolipoidoses.	2.403615015507282
The basic defect involves the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase.	2.1905594496705234
Because this enzyme is responsible for decomposition of glycosphingolipids, its deficiency results in their accumulation in endothelial and smooth muscle cells.	1.9732596869567396
With time, generalized angiokeratomas, paresthesias, renal and cardiac insufficiency and cerebrovascular complications develop.	1.913758118641803
We report a patient who in addition to the well-described findings also showed unique nail fold capillary changes not described so far.	2.1103791203484636
Analysis of serum concentration of alpha-galactosidase identified three female heterozygous carriers in the patient's family.	2.063118631947265
Benign, proliferative changes of the Brunner's gland are very rare and account for about 10 % of duodenal bulb neoplasias.	2.247495262775065
The authors present a case of Brunner's gland adenoma of unusual dimensions (12 x 5 x 2.5 cm).	2.031537939393308
The patient presented with vague epigastric discomfort as isolated symptoms.	2.1970623249585377
In this case we performed surgical treatment, including a duodenotomy and polypectomy.	2.248080833512705
Because they are localized in the submucosa small, superficial endoscopic biopsies may fail to confirm the diagnosis.	1.9987732870472832
As the majority of Brunner's adenomas are quite small, endoscopic polypectomy will confirm the diagnosis and cure the condition in most cases.	2.3023722921083123
Large symptomatic adenomas may require surgical resection.	2.352608885968239
Patient and method: A 58-year-old athlete with metastatic carcinoma of the rectum (pT3, N0, M-liver, G2) underwent regional chemotherapy (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil) via an intrahepatic port system.	2.0192505359757456
Six cycles with 5 days each were applied.	2.318058288151357
During the intervals between cycles (14 days), beginning in the 6th postoperative week, a strength and endurance training (duration 13 weeks) was carried out twice weekly with an intensity of 40-60 % of the maximum postoperative individual power and endurance (evaluated with weight and treadmill exercise tests and measurement of lactate).	1.8912462636468104
Before and after chemotherapy, an echocardiogram, resting and exercise electrocardiogram, lung function, natural killer cells and the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GLQI) was evaluated.	2.0900467912557783
After chemotherapy was finished, the effects of training were assumed.	2.5548084132184727
Results: Strength increased between 0 % and 144 %.	2.4174471793044954
Endurance improvement was measured on the last comparable submaximal intensity step, expressed by reduction of heart rate and lactate concentration by 10 and 21.5 %, respectively, improvement of lung function regarding FEV 1 and FCV by 12.9 and 11.3 %, respectively, and VC IN 11.4 %.	1.8766188837793907
The relative count of natural killer cells increased by 27.2 %, and the GLQI improved from 109 points (pathologic) to 129 points (normal).	2.0042930909848935
Conclusion: There were positive effects on muscular and cardial mechanisms of adaptation and on illness-related quality of life.	2.059134384048452
Introduction: We report our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy in comparison to open nephrectomy in geriatric patients.	2.6545727628703637
The laparoscopic technique is presented and the results are discussed with respect to the data from the current literature.	3.158285210864699
In 131 patients a laparoscopic nephrectomy (in most cases via a transperitoneal approach) was performed and in 118 patients an open nephrectomy via a flank incision.	2.129786698564832
Clinical parameters were compared between both groups as well as with respect to different age groups.	2.9606537439541856
Results: There were no differences in terms of operative results (operative time, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin) between the laparoscopy group and open nephrectomy group as well as among the different age groups.	2.5926885359764165
Patients in the laparoscopy group demonstrated significant advantages with respect to blood loss, transfusion rate, analgesic consumption, hospital stay, and convalescence.	2.3205306634072356
These advantages were not related to patient age.	2.5260526176463993
The complication rate was comparable for both groups; however, both groups showed an elevation of the complication rate in the age groups 75 to 84 years.	2.086582865788402
The mortality rate within the first 30 days after nephrectomy was 1.7% in the open nephrectomy group.	2.218977878752974
Conclusions: The laparoscopic nephrectomy offers comparable operative results (with less blood loss and a lower transfusion rate) when compared to open nephrectomy.	2.122312618035818
In terms of postoperative parameters, patients in the laparoscopy group have significant advantages.	2.3734270106731676
Especially geriatric patients benefit from these advantages and, therefore, the laparoscopic approach should be the preferred technique for a nephrectomy in these patients.	2.260345495380959
The vast majority of adder bites among children in Germany is caused by the common viper (vipera berus).	2.2032132287534387
The venom that is applicated by the viper contains several enzymes, some of them with hemorrhagic and neurotoxic activity.	2.0105057819109455
Adder bites among children may be without any symtoms but as well may cause severe intoxication.	2.0921332964528596
The aim of this study was to evaluate the results after open Bankart repair using suture anchors in patients with recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	2.0720302587040167
Some 32 patients were prospectively observed for a mean of 40 months (24-60) after stabilization.	2.3639446746277453
The mean age at the time of operation was 29.7 years.	2.3484444244949794
All patients were postoperatively immobilized in a sling for 3 weeks.	2.1277196222556043
According to the criteria of Rowe, 29 patients (90.6 %) had good or excellent results.	2.2287349494041946
Two patients (6.3 %) developed recurrent instability 6-24 months postoperatively; 93.7 % were not or only slights limited in sports activities.	1.9846700878279715
Bankart repair is an excellent treatment for recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	2.2875375008609486
The use of suture anchors is an appropriate way of reattaching the capsuloligamentous complex to the glenoid to restore stability to an unstable joint.	1.8921224217160926
Purpose: Assessment of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency with computed tomography methods has been demonstrated as an alternative to coronary angiography.	2.457760193121755
The evaluation of the bypass anastomoses is still of limited success.	2.28424672012675
Prospective ECG triggering of conventional CT scanners al- lows heart phase-triggered single-slice acquisition in the sub-second range.	1.837415227837591
The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the use of ECG triggering can optimize the evaluation of proximal CABG anastomoses.	2.4406519428231266
Multiple personality is known since last century und has been described by Breuer and Freud as well as by Kraepelin.	2.3401674221830935
In the latest and nearly exclusively angloamerican literature multiple personality disorder is included in the dissociated reactions in borderline personality disorder.	1.9509738273842476
The concept of comorbidity is criticized.	2.3187939099196413
Case studies illustrate indications for diagnosing MPD.	2.333046579351347
The authors point out, that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing.	2.247234137295024
But their development has its limits: In most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic "investigation" can be on a psychodynamic level a repetition of traumatic abuse.	2.070654197127896
Many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years, and some have already found their way into clinical routine.	2.340589986687503
Cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment.	2.126008489203912
However, the short-term culture of oocytes before metaphase II does seem relevant.	2.121782429664737
Blastocyst culture has mostly replaced coculture techniques and, given appropriate laws, provides adequate possibility of selecting embryos with high developmental and implantation potential.	1.816057918377117
An exact pronuclear diagnosis also has a high ability to predict the probability of implantation.	2.417753807297687
Viewing the latest data, assisted hatching seems to bring no improvements for most patients.	2.037546498896447
Preimplantation diagnosis is being discussed in Germany due to new statements from ethical committees.	2.1818003574038705
Cytoplasma transfer, nuclear transfer, or the transplantation of spermatogenic cells into donors are currently only experimental.	2.0935065239553547
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	1.7428509754535457
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	2.0977766825633286
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n = 98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	2.0440809775777096
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	2.0376958442855218
In the years 1980-1992 surveys were undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of central nervous system infections in children in pediatric departments in the German provinces of Bavaria and Lower Saxony.	2.0853400718687993
There was a very noticeable drop in viral meningitides over the survey years especially in mumps meningitis, i. e. from 199/205 in 1980 to 16/7 in 1992.	1.7772636429648254
In both states about 80 % of the viral meningitides could not be clarified etiologically.	2.5434801518960537
Whereas in Bavaria a steady increase in herpes simplex encephalitides and varizella zoster encephalitides was apparent (1/4 in 1980, 10/24 in 1992), the same development was not found in Lower Saxony.	1.924488845270769
Although the number of measles encephalitides dropped in both states during the period of the survey, up to 6 cases of the illness occurred annually.	2.314412002872018
Only in the case of herpes simplex encephalitis the rate of recovery shows a substantial improvement over the observation period, while for other forms the rate of partial recovery has remained approximately the same.	2.373229367992227
Purpose: To assess patient reliability and compliance, most perimeters check for false-positive and -negative answers.	1.9956934250719365
In this study the results of catch trials were obtained with video campimetry with respect to age-related changes and differences for tests using increment and decrement stimuli.	2.182848409077466
During a 7-year period (between July 1987 and June 1994) 19 patients were treated for Chopart dislocation.	2.259170606546974
Seventeen patients were examined clinically 48 months following trauma.	2.5402887296180547
We found 1 excellent, 6 good, 6 mediocre, and 4 poor results.	2.072390075966955
Only 4 patients were able to achieve their pre-accident level of work and no patients could return to sports at the same level.	2.2177389960021734
In long-term follow-up, the Chopart dislocation was the most debilitating injury even for polytrauma patients.	2.443352989362153
As a result, there are no statistical data in this field, and only case reports with a broad spectrum of suspected trigger mechanisms have been published.	2.283892584304735
The case described in this report is a proved example of a non-anesthesia-related triggering of MH in a 21-year-old man who had had an anesthetic-induced MH manifestation in childhood, which was confirmed with an in vitro contracture test.	2.1665039651443614
After visiting a restaurant, he became unconscious and convulsive after consuming a high level of alcohol (2.9permil).	1.896019467190546
The first cardiocirculatory arrest occurred directly before hospitalization.	2.1744751227687957
After admission, the patient showed a full-blown MH episode whose subsequent fatality was unavoidable in spite of adapted and optimal therapy.	2.150511866256874
Suspected trigger mechanisms seem to be multifactoral (excessive alcohol consumption, over-heating, mental stress) as a forensic investigation did not point to any particular signs of typical trigger substances.	1.8943780487585578
For patients with an MH disposition, additional information on their behavior outside the hospital is required.	2.2442061267107825
Dipterous fly maggots of different species live worldwide as parasites in hoofed mammals.	1.9448207508711715
In the host the larval development causes typical boils, i. e., abscesses including the larvae.	1.9635321338846294
As a result of increasing tourist traffic, travelers can also bring back to Germany tropical types of myiasis.	1.8495650143273483
Surgical treatment of diffuse peritonitis is applied very variably.	2.233180824454826
There is no question that source control is the most important treatment principle, but the role of additional treatment concepts such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage remains controversial.	2.379211029215366
In a prospective survey (1993-1996) we analyzed the need for additional treatment concepts in our patient material.	2.327918487450709
In 186 patients with diffuse peritonitis we applied the concept of source control and extensive (20-30 l) intraoperative lavage.	2.1148584299296553
Additional treatment principles such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage (n = 17) or staged lavage (n = 5) were applied only "on demand", namely in 20 patients (11 %).	2.0602169676802373
In 166 patients (89 %) source control of diffuse peritonitis was possible.	2.202785727252549
The mean severity of peritonitis (n = 186) was 28.5 (range 16-43) using the Mannheim Peritonitis Index.	1.934950758977769
The primary cause of peritonitis in our patients was perforation or leakage in the lower GI tract (52 %).	2.093401066636639
The hospital mortality rate was 12 % in the whole group, and the postoperative morbidity rate was 34 %.	2.6980679327379655
We conclude that nowadays, using high-quality intensive care as well as modern antiinfective treatment, only a few patients (ca.	2.5133546355321656
10 %) need additional therapy measures such as postoperative lavage.	2.3409037643479143
Surgical source control in combination with intraoperative lavage is sufficient in most of the patients with diffuse peritonitis.	2.902043529005932
Native Tissue Harmonic Imaging is a new way of ultrasound image processing that addresses the difficult-to-image patient.	2.196691877364773
By using a Gaussian shaped transmit pulse it is possible to separate from the returning echo the harmonic component without overlapping with fundamental reflections.	1.8625490758886194
The improved image quality leads to higher diagnostic confidence so that the use of further imaging modalitites is unnecessary.	2.3306778283680707
Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the detection of calcified arteriosclerotic plaques with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).	2.2176718954401466
The ultrasound cross-sections were compared to the corresponding radiologic (30 kV) and histologic cross-sections.	2.3007482341929015
Results: Calcified lesions were imaged as bright echos with shadowing.	2.0434623012736344
In 13 cases of 161 calcified lesions were too small to detect by IVUS.	2.108892621068861
In 5 ultrasonic sections the diagnosis "calcified lesion" could not be verified neither by radiology nor by histology.	2.088299321644846
The sensitivity was 91.6%, the specificity was 94.7% and the accuracy was 93.0%.	2.093155373348961
Conclusions: Because of the acoustic properties of calcium, calcified lesions can be detected accurately by IVUS.	2.254747692741274
IVUS can generate new insights into the effect of plaque composition on the response to catheter therapies.	2.374239888666121
Hillel Klein has called the holocaust "the dark core of the twentieth century".	2.0230107874043
It was the aim of weekly conferences, held in Israel in 1994 and 1996, to explore its repercussions on current behaviour.	1.8798971028971443
The topic was "The past in the present".	2.477440225600662
The participants were Israelis and Germans, the staff international.	2.113254260747251
The method used was the application of the "group relations conference", specially devised for these conferences.	2.271457109326375
The leadership was in the hands of Eric J. Miller, director of the group relations program at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London, where this group method originated and continues to be particularly cultivated still today.	1.7449908340069682
It is especially suited when an unconscious conflict between subgroups exists that emerges on the surface in forms which lead to confusion and misunderstandings.	1.8563754850592364
The task which had been put to the participants was as follows: to explore how feelings and fantasies influence relations within and between the two groups.	1.9027731746631187
This was easy to remember but not always easy to adhere to.	2.1810742167847232
There were moments when fantasy and reality got confused, accompanied by intense feelings.	1.9138376978868223
In this paper my experience with a databank for cases with bone diseases is reported.	2.017731958355503
All cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed Department of Bone Pathology of the University of Hamburg since 1970 were registered in uniform fashion.	2.097978577256345
Adapting the system to state-of-the-art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment.	2.0690662768709456
This could not be accomplished by university resources alone, but only in cooperation with other research funds.	2.4488649247996
Now 76 000 cases can be routinely accessed and scientifically analysed.	2.092518038691394
However, the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia.	2.2699911721364785
The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and microtropia screening.	2.007237566986576
The fluorescence diagnosis based on the aminolavulinic acid-stimulated porphyrin synthesis allows the detection of superficial tumors in a very early stage even when they are very small tumors.	2.227235185425311
A fluorescence diagnosis of tumors in the oral cavity can be simply performed by rinsing with a 0.4% ALA solution for 20 min.	2.1674375622201727
This topical application avoids systemic side effects such as skin sensitization.	2.3475955846327565
The red fluorescent areas are visible to the naked eye; only a blue light source for fluorescence excitation is necessary and a suitable red filter for observation.	1.8772515149779525
In our study on 56 patients suffering from carcinoma of the oral cavity, 96% of the histologically confirmed carcinoma could be visualized via fluorescence.	2.2402446267243388
In 3 patients additional tumors were detected via fluorescence that were not visible otherwise.	2.0495616050721948
However, many patients show fluorescent areas with no correlation to the histological finding.	2.2693873983164186
It was verified that bacteria from the oral cavity also produce PpIX after ALA incubation, which leads to false-positive findings.	2.028928722847605
Reduction of the false-positive findings was achieved by rinsing the oral cavity with hydrogen peroxide and by mechanical plaque reduction.	2.1859330728608155
This improves the reliability of a fluorescence-guided biopsy.	2.2456514574556663
However, suppression of the bacteria fluorescence is necessary for clinical use of this diagnostic method.	2.625626308276977
Autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers.	2.0734827893835286
Based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response, autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation.	2.596268707679262
Increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude.	2.1630820108945965
Automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds.	2.4215269057721094
Thus, changes in threshold can be monitored over a long period and utilized as a diagnostic tool.	2.2329604535898553
This case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a microdislodgement by means of autocapture.	2.6943485155010594
The indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed controversely.	2.3537971070597496
Successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events.	2.6705821146462885
However, several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events.	2.530617071778741
Tissue engineering offers the possibility to fabricate living substitutes for tissues and organs by combining histogenic cells and biocompatible carrier materials.	1.9011132493260583
Pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells are isolated and subcultured ex vivo and then their histogenic differentiation is induced by external factors.	1.9531329567353468
The fabrication of bone and cartilage constructs, their combinations and gene therapeutic approaches are demonstrated.	2.22063956395214
Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are described by in vitro and in vitro testing.	2.4674024778583714
The proof of histotypical function after implantation in vivo is essential.	2.149302514024365
The use of autologous cells and tissue engineering methods offers the possibility to overcome the disadvantages of classical tissue reconstruction - donor site morbidity of autologous grafts, immunogenicity of allogenic grafts and loosening of alloplastic implants.	1.8178427860016892
Furthermore, tissue engineering widens the spectrum of surgical indications in bone and cartilage reconstruction.	2.265410255123017
The purpose of this paper is to present principle and technique of proximal lateral column lengthening by calcaneal osteotomy and to critically analyze our preliminary results.	1.8604656955537184
16 patients (7 female, 9 male; average age 52.3 years [24-72 years]) were treated for stage II to III posterior tibial tendon insufficiency by calcaneal osteotomy and medial soft tissue reconstruction (tendon reconstruction, 15; tendon transfer, 8; deltoid ligament repair, 10).	1.8447635205440105
When the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Rating Scale was applied, these patients were shown to have significantly increased their scores from an average preoperative value of 49.1 to a mean postoperative value of 91.1 after a mean follow-up of 24.6 months.	2.0582300314925934
In all but one case no loss of achieved foot correction was noted.	2.0796746414455334
In one case, a fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint had to be performed after 5 months due to painful degenerative joint disease.	2.3027867023029644
At follow-up, all patients had satisfactory restoration of their medial longitudinal arch, reduction of forefoot abduction, and restored arch height.	2.1098990991433935
All patients were able to fully weight-bear the operated foot, and all patients were satisfied with the achieved result.	2.1370429855225037
In the pes planovalgus deformity occurring in stage II to III (as significant degenerative joint disease has not already occurred), osteotomies appear to have a significant role in the operative management and to function by restoring more normal biomechanics, thus allowing tendon reconstruction and tendon transfers to return to successfull function.	1.961059546270163
By the update of §24 a of the German road traffic act driving under the influence of drugs of abuse can now be fined even in absence of an actual driving impairment.	2.04221824694146
The only requisite is the detection of certain drugs/metabolites in a blood sample.	2.4079301980605137
Therefore for pretesting there is a need for fast and reliable immunological screening methods in blood/serum.	2.256483970148287
The new Mahsan microtiterplate enzyme immunoassay (MTP-EIA) is claimed to be sensitive and independent of the matrix.	1.9568164050122885
For the MTP-EIAs we used the cut-off recommendations of the supplier (cannabinoids 2 ng/mL, opiates 10 ng/mL).	1.988391639863494
For the Abbott FPIAs the serum samples had to be pretreated (deproteinization with acetone) and appropriate cut-offs were defined by our investigations (cannabinoids 20 ng/mL, opiates 30 ng/mL).	1.772457803637928
Out of 136 samples screened for cannabinoids 42% were positive with GC-MS and 18% from 123 samples were positive for opiates.	1.819408276099484
Each of the two cannabinoid assays gave false positive results in 13% of the cases and for the MTP opiate assay 2% of the positives could not be confirmed with GC-MS. As a result of our study the cut-off values for the MTP-EIAs have proved to be suitable for a distinction between potential positives and true negatives.	2.323470602694516
Systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in 1978 by Mihatsch.	2.128753516495205
Seven cases have been reported to date.	2.961935692272382
We give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30-year-old Italian man.	2.2800765701635886
Bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells, Schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and, less obviously, in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels, in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain.	2.0398521972985137
These findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis, nonspecific hepatopathy, adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple slerosis.	2.2232083503912046
The clinical course was marked by chronic renal failure, chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation.	2.1823545859681324
The patient died 8 years after diagnosis in septic-toxic shock.	2.276237429965058
The aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed.	2.9604583035098733
17% of malignant melanomas (n=100) investigated in a dermatologic practice were less than 6 mm in maximal diameter (median diameter: 4.0 +/- 0.9 mm).	2.041202021675572
The median age of the 17 patients at diagnosis of small-diameter melanomas was 42 years.	2.403366183833309
The essential epiluminescence microscopic and histopatologic features of these small melanomas resembled those of larger lesions, although their clinical criteria differed from the classic ABCDs.	1.8892883703557148
6 (35,3%) of the small melanomas were were found to be in situ.	3.1549086039266645
This percentage was nearly similar to those in situ lesions within the group of melanomas of 6 mm in diameter or larger (38,3%).	2.2376187816199535
The remaining 11 small lesions were classified as invasive from Clark's level I to V, including all classic histogenetic types (superficial spreading, nodular, unclassified, desmoplastic).	1.7612222591801996
The median thickness of the small invasive melanomas was 0,76 +/- 0,23 mm.	2.1868912384212864
7 small melanomas had apparent histologic remnants of a melanocytic nevus.	2.0796411898273015
Epiluminescence microscopic features of the melanomas were evaluated and statistically compared with those of 100 dysplastic nevi and 50 spindle cell nevi.	2.1300498566136064
The technique of epiluminescence microscopy allowed the identification of such malignant melanomas that could not be discerned by the naked eye or by a pocket-lens.	2.116210764294248
Mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential.	2.141155478075112
It is widely distributed in soil and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons.	1.9301235597304263
In recent years, there have been numerous reports of infections by M. gordonae in immunocompromised patients.	2.06553199151037
In contrast, only four cases of skin infections by M. gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published.	2.1828636262331784
We report on another patient without evidence of immunodeficiency who developed an atypical mycobacteriosis after a thorn injury during gardening.	1.9193231210212922
M. gordonae was isolated by tissue culture.	2.4025647282235965
The skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with doxycycline for three months.	2.202886729001132
The article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors.	2.1439157696341664
Biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic findings are discussed.	2.24426508104387
It has been established, that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the parathyroids and the liver.	2.1981659499865374
The underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear, however.	2.39213042208616
In particular, one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia.	1.9353560606094156
Furthermore, organ-dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist.	2.1108729997255913
Oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs.	2.414416988255571
The molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is, however, still unknown.	2.9216357481297828
The authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor-specific MR contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function.	2.0379963320690044
Receptor specificity of MR contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor-specific carriers to ligands.	2.317438785416525
This concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity.	2.3717769707110326
Specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor-organ contrast and therefore tumor detection.	2.0202676435591154
Specific uptake mechanisms also enable the assessment of organ function.	2.395894597842101
Future design concepts of novel MR contrast agents may consider the desired uptake in specific cells or organs (ovaries, adrenal glands, lymph nodes etc.)	1.901377128072831
with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers.	2.5239168314970652
It is one of the primary perforating disorders characterized by transepithelial elimination of abnormal elastic fibers.	2.3386188767266387
This may reflect an immunological reaction aquist elastic fibers.	2.0973556836868013
We describe a 40-year-old woman with Down's syndrome whose skin lesions were histologically mistaken for lupus vulgaris for a long time.	1.969510893710282
The position of the talus and the os calcaneum has consequences for the architecture of the forefoot.	2.3652535975858697
Medial tilting of the talus with vertical position provokes flattening of the medial arch and abduction of the forefoot.	2.2620766423306398
Varus position of the calcis and lateral direction of the talus (as in residual clubfoot), however, causes supination and adduction of the forefoot.	2.4406927663679947
Repair of deformities in the hindfoot therefore also influences the forefoot.	2.157263501228779
A large number of various osteotomies have been proposed at both bones.	2.3552835353411283
The most popular ones are Dwyer's osteotomy at the corpus of the calcis and its modification described by Mitchell at the same location for correction of the cavus foot and the residual clubfoot, and the lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans.	1.9723917557248485
Indication and operative technique of these three procedures are described in detail.	2.6018173472950537
In clubfeet the os calcis is usually too short and the medial opening wedge osteotomy provokes skin problems.	1.9907909451011756
In these cases an osteotomy according to Mitchell with lateral displacement of the tuber calcanei is more suitable.	1.9436522551828006
In flat- and skewfeet a lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans can be indicated, especially when the load of the foot is bigger medially under the talus rather than at the lateral margin of the foot.	1.9647242865157717
If these procedures are carried out carefully, they have low complications rates.	2.0971997223062844
Between January 1994 and August 1998, 12 patients with 13 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis muscleflap.	1.997433213287458
One patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides.	2.378091773206119
In all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection.	2.6395026941777306
The average duration of infection was 8.3 months.	2.388528999699738
The patients had undergone an average of 3.8 operations.	2.707174994793215
Up to now there was no recurrent infection, controlled by clinical investigation, ultrasound and laboratory findings in all 13 cases.	2.2871606108559446
Follow up investigation occured 2.5 years (1.5-4.7) after flap transfer.	2.0874008604073255
The flap is easy to harvest.	2.6737546753112165
He has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation.	2.1158587532329247
The functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal.	2.204854812823171
That vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region.	2.1445127336380954
Information technologies have been integrated in gynecological oncology treatment and, therefore, new software has been established in hospitals and private clinics.	2.2378479863907645
A German law for hospital tumor registration has attempted to unify the different strategies.	2.010046768496753
All intentions to establish new documentation systems for tumor diseases need a standardized basic data set.	1.9768219414106443
Nevertheless, local governmental health organizations are not yet prepared to implement a global information system such as prenatal and perinatal care databases.	1.8716929515325247
To optimise the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis.	1.9799982319362621
This includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials, human placenta and the rat model.	2.265751090192964
The most important role in this concept is played by the placenta.	2.54552366976796
It supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis.	2.0439612782439696
As to availability, handling and costs the placenta is superior to animal models and has replaced them almost completely in our educational concept.	1.942191824916274
Since Manfred Bleuler's description of the clinical picture of late onset schizophrenia over 50 years ago, debate has persisted as to whether it is justifiable to differentiate this as a valid, independent entity from the group of classic schizophrenic disorders with early onset.	2.160145157515479
As this review shows, this question cannot be answered unequivocally even now.	2.1668445045951006
It must rather be remarked that we have neither been able to decisively extend our knowledge since Manfred Bleuler's comprehensive contribution, nor managed to achieve a much sounder basis methodologically.	1.7592077067341862
The reasons for this are the international conceptual and terminological confusion that has developed around this illness group, and on the other hand the methodological limitations of the empirical studies conducted on this clinical picture so far.	2.0596258191095678
Definition of the problem: In parallel with public and philosophical discussions, there is an ongoing debate about euthanasia in theological ethics.	1.9582541546723204
In this situation it is helpful to provide a systematic overview of the different arguments and judgements.	2.258605971800367
Arguments: A short introduction is followed by a first part dealing with the definition of terms.	2.3780098201686197
The second and major part concerning normative arguments is subdivided into three steps: the level of principles, the more concrete level of actions and finally the level of social consequences.	2.000416828094966
The third part presents some reflections following the eudaimonistic ethical tradition (the ethics of a good life and death) focusing on the central question: how to find meaning in life when faced with suffering.	1.8112446300911165
Conclusion: It would be fruitful to intensify the ethical reflection both on the problems concerning the foundations of social life, especially the meaning of dignity, autonomy and inviolability of human life, and social consequences of a liberal practice of euthanasia.	1.859781886571632
In this context ethicists are challenged to reflect on the different approaches to what is or can be a good life and a human death.	1.9018278419324575
Multimodal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinomas today is based on surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.	2.587745775739397
Despite the combination of all three therapeutic options, there is still a large number of treatment failures and therefore major questions remain.	2.492952742626562
Recent investigations suggest that mutations of the p53 tumor supressor gene may account for some of the therapeutic failures.	2.2588775866113924
Inactivation of the gene may be an  important determinant of the efficiacy of today's multimodal therapy protocols.	2.2714520155944165
In 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity biopsy specimens were taken before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy.	2.3990300299136464
From all patients, biopsy and resection material was available for immunohistochemical analysis of p53.	2.2720801684129373
After radiation treatment, 51 patients (57%) showed a complete response; 39 patients (43%) only showed a partial response or did not respond at all.	2.142588565786349
Among the responders, 82% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive, whereas among the nonresponders only 56% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive.	1.7795542184556747
The majority of the residual tumors were also p53 negative according to immunohistology after radiation treatment.	1.9835136156315425
In our study, detection of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry seemed to be connected with a more radiosensitive reaction of the tumors.	2.1438642091841964
Nevertheless, successful strategies for radiation therapy may need to take into account the tissue of origin and the status of p53 in the tumor.	2.3005653074579433
The human cartilage and bone is characterized by a remodeling during the life, well balanced by neosynthesis and degradation of matrix components.	2.0997654954496676
In different joint diseases, it becomes imbalanced and the destruction of the cartilage supersedes the repair.	2.196329245469844
In tissue processes in disease and in normal turnover of the matrix, these molecules are fragmented and released into surrounding fluids, in the synovial fluid, and then in the blood and the urin, where they can be detected.	2.190692774089303
The quantitative measurement in the synovial fluid is more specific than in the other body fluids.	2.4215410374097326
The research process in recent years has suggested that these molecular markers of cartilage and bone matrix metabolism can be used to determine diagnosis, the disease severity rather than its presence or absence, the prognosis, and the response to therapy.	2.4229426027276397
They should help to identify the disease mechanism in different joint diseases not only on the tissue but also on the molecular level.	2.29536962708505
The specific cartilage matrix markers promise to become useful tools in the future in clinical use.	2.293854129611616
The research in this area is still in the early stages, with most results dated from the end of the 1980s and the 1990s.	2.4554107435698076
Axillary block is a common anaesthetic technique for operations on the hand and forearm.	2.52813504955132
This implies a small number of blocks for each anaesthetist.	2.495293618774824
The present study was designed to assess whether it is possible to teach this technique and use it with an adequate degree of success under these conditions.	2.1377170004892014
We used a nerve stimulator and studied whether the success of the block under these conditions is independent of anaesthetist's experience in this technique.	1.994489148269571
Furthermore, we examined other factors involved in the success of the block.	2.637698263240352
The study included 112 patients subjected to elective surgery of the upper extremity; all received an axillary block.	2.1611855273718645
We used a nerve stimulator and injected mepivacaine 1% without adrenaline.	1.911178337754205
The following parameters were recorded: the number of blocks to date performed by the anaesthetist; the minimal current required for nerve stimulation; the dose of local anaesthetic; the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery; the duration of surgery; and the quality of sensory and motor blockade after 10, 20, and 30 min.	2.4449586465296322
Sensory blockade was assessed by the pinprick method (no blockade, analgesia, anaesthesia); motor blockade was judged by comparing the muscle strength of both arms (no blockade, paresis, paralysis).	1.8504366661258342
Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, with P<0.05 considered statistically significant.	2.0996885332461623
Of the 112 blocks, 95 (85%) were successful; 17 (15%) failed and the patients required general anaesthesia.	2.085559426332509
Eight of the successful blocks showed a decrease in analgesic quality after >=70 min and required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia.	2.0975991235457054
We found no correlation between the experience of the anaesthetist and the success of the block.	2.476280499530794
The dose of mepivacaine was higher in the success group (5.9 vs. 5.3 mg/kg).	2.2301361752153297
Complete sensory blockade was more frequently achieved for the median, ulnar, and radial nerves than for the musculocutaneous and cutaneous brachii medialis (Fig.	1.8339466870960814
The frequency of complete sensory blockade (anaesthesia) had increased by 21.9% between the 20th and 30th min.	1.962124468067248
Complete motor blockade was less often achieved than sensory blockade (Fig.	2.1349231071040777
Using the method of electrostimulation, the axillary block is an appropriate anaesthetic technique that can be applied in a hospital where each anaesthetist only occasionally performs it.	2.3502760812777392
Prior to injection of the local anaesthetic, the current for nerve stimulation should be reduced to <0.5 mA.	2.329050591570513
The time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery should be no less than 30 min because complete sensory blockade can more often be achieved.	2.1653421495104284
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was discovered 10 years ago as a growth factor that can regulate angiogenesis and in addition the permeability of blood vessels.	2.082008721765747
Numerous studies have revealed that it is essential for normal embryonic development and that it plays a major role in physiological and pathological events of angiogenesis in adults.	2.167729604116442
It is unique in that its expression is regulated directly by hypoxia.	2.097194304560485
These properties are now being exploited in attempts aimed at the induction of new blood vessels in pathological situations such as ischemic heart disease.	1.9986380128980457
Five VEGF forms of 121 to 206 amino-acids are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing.	1.915284590871463
Cells expressing VEGF usually express several forms simultaneously.	2.1966487243657395
VEGF121 does not contain exons 6 and 7 of the gene and consequently lacks a heparin binding ability.	2.1432274947064847
However, this form is fully  active as an inducer of angiogenesis, and as a blood vessel permeabilizing agent.	2.0113088933281618
Exon 6 and 7 contain 2 independent heparin binding domains.	2.2521462022595515
The VEGF form containing exon 7 (VEGF165) and the vascular endothelial growth factor form containing exon 6 (VEGF145) display similar biological potencies raising the question of why so many VEGF forms are required.	1.921799621005672
It was found that VEGF121 diffuses better because it does not bind to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans.	1.943014585162389
In contrast, VEGF145 binds to extracellular matrix ad is released from it slowly.	1.8760986055944533
When the receptor binding properties of VEGF121 and VEGF165 were compared it was found that VEGF165 binds to a class of VEGF receptors that is not recognized by VEGF121.	1.8596952824790776
These receptors are encoded by the neuropilin-1 gene, and we have recently found that the related neuropilin-2 gene also encodes a VEGF165 receptor.	1.9706357925546174
We have recently found evidence indicating the neuropilins form complexes with another VEGF receptor, VEGFR-1.	1.8713293780987923
However, the biological function of this complex remains to be elucidated.	2.3401238338939727
In addition to mucositis and myelotoxicity as well known early reactions after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck tumors, late toxicity following treatment is an often underestimated problem.	1.8767821670138596
The healing of wounds by secondary  intention is a simple method to close  operative defects.	2.2535899430083624
The quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the  defect.	2.489086873903169
Best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave  geometry and when the defect lies  symmetrically at the interface of two  anatomic subunits.	2.0252425008994557
Partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric  defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention.	1.9214597525373032
This simple and efficient operative procedure is ilustrated by two case reports.	2.239071563098463
Background: Acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a selflimiting lymphoproliferative disease of EBV-infected (immortalised) B cells and poly-/oligoclonal cytotoxic T cells which are to a high percentage EBV-specific.	1.921324086993788
In B cells EBV infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of EBV nuclear antigens 1-6 (EBNA1-6) and membrane antigens 1, 2A and 2B (LMP1, LMP2A and LMP2B).	1.9165339998289501
Expression of these EBV latent antigens leads to transformation and immortalisation of infected B cells.	1.9399123947608268
Here we examined if also lytic EBV genes (i.e.	2.0363278994197986
BZLF1), which are associated with a productive EBV infection, are expressed during IM.	2.841317305678029
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a frequent underlying disease in young patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden death.	2.326217127143382
Treatment is frequently indicated and is mainly directed at the prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	2.2288780885800294
In a minority of patients with progressive ARVCM and clinical signs of heart failure, pharmacological treatment with vasodilators, diuretics, and digitalis may be required.	2.4320281463716262
A prospective study was performed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a bone scan to detect subclinical invasion of the mandible by squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and floor of mouth.	2.456708018248026
The typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after strenous exercise.	2.1087093611113903
Ocular muscle involvement with ptosis (in 50%) and diplopia (in 25%) are the most common initial signs.	2.3069596230393583
The disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles (generalized myasthenia).	1.9704826545535938
The muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can mislead to a diagnosis of neurasthenia.	2.1366585501316084
Since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease.	2.798567849348401
Also, a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy.	2.9343547244250665
The mainstay of the diagnosis is the history and a subtle clinical examination with tests of excessive muscle fatiguability.	2.3381991433393376
The injection of edrophonium (Tensilon), the electrodiagnostic testing after repitive stimulation (decrement test) and the testing for serum antibodies against acetylcholin receptors have to be performed to secure the diagnosis of myasthenia.	2.4197583938713008
The edrophonium test and the decrement test can yield false positive results in other neuromuscular diseases.	2.1062166093314088
Antibodies are present in 50% of ocular myasthenia and in 80-90% of the generalized form.	2.305496722613897
The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, other neuromuscular diseases, mitochondrial diseases, diseases of the cranial nerves, botulism and the rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have to be considered as differential diagnosis.	2.1306136251547367
The application of biodegradable implants is combined with advantages and disadvan- tages.	2.0136816584487844
They offer a great deal of innovative ideas.	2.3407141605440374
Best evaluation has been done with pins for the fixation of low loaded osteochondral fractures.	2.1785028930169923
When using 2,7 mm Polypin primary mechanical stabilility of distal radius fractures is comparable with the fixation by 1,8 mm K-wires.	1.9831328879311514
A prospective and randomised study with two years follow up, including 183 radial head fractures, showed no significant difference in results and complications in metal and polyactide implants.	2.1523580906384794
For this localisation and other comparable indications the implant can be recommended.	2.3167003191172877
Despite the more extensive degradable device overall costs can be reduced with the polymer implant.	2.024841847058414
The treatment of deep cartilage defects is a challenge for every orthopeadic surgeon.	2.1960744236487484
The potention for regeneration of cartilage tissue is minimal and leads to mechanically inferior fibrous tissue.	2.037120521885176
The established techniques induce the growth of fibrous tissue but fail to prevent arthrosis.	2.170269517427519
Autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be the most promising therapy concept with clinical relevance to reserves a full thickness cartilage defekt with hyaline-like cartilage.	2.0209875046510803
Outcome studies with a follow up from 2-10 years show in up to 90 % good and excellent results for defects on the femoral condyle and 70 % for the patella.	2.24977085960458
Mechanical testing of the regenerated cartilage showed almost simular stiffness as nearly normal hyaline cartilage.	1.9718623356671643
The available data justify the acceptance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation as a standard procedure for limited indications and well-trained surgeons.	2.154954030650246
Result of already inaugurated studies will show the potential of chondrocyte transplantation to prevent osteoarthritis.	2.1423046122184433
Vasculitides are rare diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels.	2.5008404420658423
According to diameter of the blood vessels involved in the inflammatory process, the clinical presentation and the histological appearance, different vasculitic syndromes may be distinguished.	2.5287155913265313
Primary vasculitides are of unknown origin while secondary vasculitides may be caused by drugs, malignancy or infection.	2.063716996999036
Panarteriitis nodosa caused by chronic Hepatitis B and mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to chronic Hepatitis C are classical examples of vasculitides triggered by infections.	1.8168690779358512
However, these are rare complications of chronic viral hepatitis.	2.3323209724600176
Patients infected by HIV frequently suffer from vasculitis, which may be caused by opportunistic infections and by defects in immune regulation.	2.202076354771196
In numerous case reports, various other infectious particles have been reported to cause different forms of vasculitis, either by direct infection of endothelial cells or by induction of an immunologic process leading to blood vessel destruction.	2.0325886144611784
Immunologically mediated vasculitis secondary to infection may be due to a predisposing reactivity of the patient's immune system.	2.4964931830023596
After successful treatment of the infection, the vasculitis usually subsides.	2.490446080467793
Therefore, all patients with vasculitis should be evaluated for underlying infection.	2.712947791951578
To calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre- and postoperative computed tomographies of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by USS (universal spine system).	1.9230344433905753
Our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the dispaced fragments which was performed in all 32 cases.	2.476487008077081
We found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area (ASP preoperatively 55 %, postop.	1.9158758345636007
80 %) and midsagittal diameter (MSD preop.	2.349088796608127
10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit, no neurological deterioration occured.	2.1483127398063924
Fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise (52 %) and less midsagittal diameter (MSD compromise 51 %) than those without (40 % or 39 %).	1.841715775832407
There was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit.	2.417819461616758
Below L 1 the spinal canal is greater than between Th 11 and L 1, so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated.	2.0422809149772703
In fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long-term damages such as myelopathia and claudicatio spinalis.	2.0215696384048143
In common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury.	2.5548030859705064
An exact diagnosis is mandatory as well as a differentiated therapy.	2.803820518665188
Especially the correct decision about the therapy (operative vs conservative) including the technical demanding operative procedures is based on an experienced surgeon.	2.2387143604678656
These patients should be transferred to a specialised centre.	2.6166895840534945
The intensity of DNA degradation in fixed tissues is dependent on the fixation solution and the fixation time.	2.312405649974803
The aim of this study was the investigation of DNA degradation over fixation times of up to 70 days in different tissues (muscle, brain, liver, bone) and with different formalin concentration (2 %, 4 %, 8 %; unbuffered).	2.0522386659937064
An additional test was performed to see whether the fixed tissues could be individualized using PCR analysis.	2.199462372465348
The smallest amounts of DNA were extracted from liver and brain and the largest from muscle and bone.	1.9790386864830456
The amount of DNA that could be extracted decreased with increasing formalin concentration, while at the same time DNA degradation increased.	2.1221700929175413
With the PCR-VNTR system HUMTH 01, all fixed samples could be typed regardless of the fixation time and the formalin concentration.	1.9617565136037942
The draining sinus is an unpleasant complication of acne conglobata, acne fulminans, acne inversa, rosacea conglobata and rosacea fulminans (pyoderma faciale).	1.6543108977423384
It is most common on the face, especially in the nasolabial folds, and on the neck below the mandibular line.	2.3869534782203177
Clinically, it is an elongated (2-5 cm long), elevated, periodically inflamed lesion, which sporadically discharges pus.	2.3695705277971086
The lesion persists with no tendency to spontaneous regression.	2.2245531456429277
Histopathologically, it consists of elaborate, epithelialized galleries connected to the skin surface at multiple points.	2.1068400924536
It contains corneocytes, hairs, bacteria, serum, inflammatory cells and epitheloid granulomas.	1.995492414808274
A surgical thread placed into the skin provides a model in which the generation of sinus tracts can be studied.	2.2433866507232434
Intralesional corticosteroid injection, cryosurgery and isotretinoin are not always very effective.	2.144212914549386
Sometimes complete excision of the lesion is necessary.	2.97739043092689
The draining sinus is a special form of scar analogous to the pilonidal cyst.	2.0307154573211057
A thoracic outlet syndrome is only rarely caused by osseous anomalies.	2.215378974823281
Instead, it is a soft-tissue disease, where the C8 and T1 roots or the proximal inferior trunk of the brachial plexus are compressed by fibromuscular anomalies between the inferior cervical spine and the first rib or pleura.	2.1935861050762626
Thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical diagnosis.	2.8934444485829074
If surgery is recommended, it should be concentrated on the fibromuscular anomalies and not on the first rib.	2.461967217225768
Transaxillary removal of the first rib carries an important risk of serious complications.	2.951669064714892
Among these, brachial plexus injury is the most frequent one.	2.644797749775273
Objective: The objective of this survey was to investigate the current status of the epidural and intrathecal management in patients with chronic cancer and non-cancer pain in Germany and Austria.	2.867996620353381
Methods: In June 1997 a questionnaire was sent to 598 German and Austrian anaesthesiologists specialized in pain therapy.	1.9445848172188727
Questions concerning the use of medicaments for epidural and intrathecal treatment of chronic pain were asked.	2.7815034935190623
Results: The response rate was 23%.	2.4995148037263646
The data show that 78% of the anaesthesiologists use epidural or intrathecal analgesia in the therapy of chronic pain.	2.1983593773267454
Local anaesthetics are used by 85% of these anaesthesiologists, followed by morphine (72%), clonidine (48%), buprenorphine (34%), baclofen (20%), fentanyl (13%) and sufentanil (10%).	1.96357541155474
For most of the treatments local anaesthetics are used, again followed by opioids und clonidine.	2.3175477039092396
In the 137 answering pain clinics 79.821 epidural and intrathecal analgetic treatments are performed per year.	1.916826718133693
Discussion: Epidural and intrathecal pain therapy is frequently used in Germany and Austria, either as a complementary or alternative treatment to systemic pain therapy.	2.093440389228202
Local anaesthetics followed by opioids are the most commonly used medicaments for this treatment.	2.374196444004596
For some of the applied substances neurotoxicological data are lacking.	2.517131857763692
The use of these substances has to be considered very carefully.	2.850410616529652
Intraartial conduction disturbances (IACD) are the known substrate of re-entrant atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy.	2.2168065527200858
Signs of IACD can be missed on the standard ECG, and signal averaged (SA) P wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological (EPS) properties of atrial myocardium.	1.9483254491226814
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing are known to electrophysiologists, but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice, and RAA based pacing modes remain standard even for pts.	1.9833416218876565
We examined and compared EPS effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools: IEGM obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system (via telemetry) and time domain analysis of SA P wave in 22 pts.	1.8063026822812385
with BiA pacing system (implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and IACD).	2.1267791898249193
The results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently: RAA pacing aggravates IACD in comparison to sinus rhythm; the effects of CS pacing is less visible.	1.9741039305495025
BiA pacing normalises all atrial activation times.	2.3409979256383666
The normalisation of SA P wave duration, reduction of SA P wave dispersion, increasing of RMS 20 and decreasing of LAS 5 and finally abolition of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts.	1.873610292562236
indicates beneficial effects of BiA pacing (in pts.	2.45961093153698
with IACD) in comparison to sinus rhythm and RAA pacing.	2.726855885691019
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing in patients with IACD indicates suitability the need for alternative (resynchronising) atrial pacing modes.	2.3327623131924176
Time domain analysis of SA P wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non-invasive evaluation of EPS effects of different modes of atrial pacing.	2.2840718499977464
Background: We report a case of irreversible unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy in connection with nasal septum surgery in intubation anaesthesia.	2.2996502238498744
On account of the spatial distance, there is no danger of injuring the hypoglossal nerve during nasal surgery.	2.2056031102582945
However, in the otorhinolaryngological and anaesthesiological literature, some cases of hypoglossal palsy following endotracheal intubation, use of the laryngeal mask airway, bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy are reported.	2.1343145813514965
The endoscopic guided puncture tracheostomy has established itself in many intensive care units.	2.077345879334531
Manufacturers offer complete tracheostomy kits, based on the described techniques from Ciaglia (Cook-Set), as well as from Griggs (Portex-Set).	2.2045484679318736
The goal of this investigation was to show the advantages, disadvantages, costs and risks of the puncture tracheostomy and to make a comparison using conventional procedures.	2.0740943109394263
Chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis may occur in children, adolescents and adults, but has not been found in newborns or babies either in our series or in the literature.	2.3601729135008815
Symptoms suggesting an acute disease like fever are uncommon, but a primary chronic course with symptomatic and asymptomatic periods is typical.	1.9292533455744503
Pain and swelling are the main symptoms; painless masses are rare.	2.3420486782380654
In children and adolescents the clavicle and metaphyseal regions of long bones are typical sites of chronic abacterial osteomyelitis.	2.12279022667997
In adults the clavicles or the first two ribs are mainly affected with synovitis of the adjacent joints, but the long bones are rarely involved.	2.14873093159504
Laboratory findings are non-specific but important for the differential diagnosis.	2.6660841056263074
The sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein might be elevated.	2.3113107046553103
The X-ray examination shows osteolytic, sclerotic or mixed bony changes and, in case of a diaphyseal involvement, onionskinlike periosteal bone formation may be present, suggesting a malignant process.	2.1583196148152206
In late stages sclerotic bone formations may be seen as a rest.	2.282573993282117
Uni- or multifocal lesions can be detected by bonescan, as can asymptomatic lesions.	2.335209461585799
Magnetic resonance imaging shows gross signal intensity differences both in the bone and perifocal soft tissue and involvement of the synovium with gadolinium DPTA enhancement in T1-weighted images.	2.0017008159930016
In early stages of the disease granulocytes, microabscesses and new bone formations might suggest bacterial osteomyelitis that cannot be differentiated by histology.	2.1654968113828432
In intermediate phases lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrates are found, whereas in late phases sclerotic bone formations and fibrosis of the bone marrow are seen histologically.	2.1297674574709324
In chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis, all clinical, radiological and histological findings, as well as negative bacteriological cultures, are mandatory and will allow a definitive diagnosis to be made.	2.20377737027148
The disease may be uni- or multifocal, and new bone lesions may occur over time, as well as skin manifestations, which can be found years before or after bone involvement.	2.4278188296391017
The association with dermatological diseases and/or synovitis led to the acronym SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteomyelitis).	2.1088956413172912
For the treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for pain relief, reduction of swelling and dysfunction.	2.1812660965531525
Antibiotics have been used in several series and are not effective.	2.719776103196986
Major surgery is not recommended even for recurrences, and the prognosis for growth and function is excellent in the long term despite recurrences over several years.	2.451114189335249
A woman with severe stiff-man syndrome showed periodic cardiovascular dysregulation.	2.1753647287773634
The blood pressure changed spontaneously every 5-10 min.	2.4114631194733733
This rhythm was also maintained after relaxation.	2.3907458405971687
However, the vegetative and motoric disturbances disappeared after intrathecal application of baclofen.	1.9450911664617214
It is speculated that spinal GABAergic mechanisms are responsible for the tonic regulation of the cardiovascular system.	2.296392473805164
The frequency and prognostic relevance of sarcoid-likelesions and microcarcinosis in regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer (n = 113; pT1-3, pN0-1, pM0, R0) were investigated; the prognostic value was compared with pT and pN stage, grading and Laurén's tumor classification with Cox's multivariate regression-model.	1.900328829011344
Sarcoid like lesions were found in 34 % of the cases (n = 113).	2.8798827800237765
Statistical analysis did not indicate that they had any prognostic value or showed whether or not microcarcinosis or metastasis was present; they were independent of pT stage, histological tumor type, tumor grading, and the clinical course of disease.	2.1955708130238145
Microcarcinosis (defined as scattered carcinoma cells within lymph node sinuses or pulp without adjacent stromal reaction) was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 90 % of pN0 cases; the presence of 3 or more tumor cells per lymph node section in over 10 % of sampled lymph nodes per case carried a significant prognostic value.	1.7977129408761214
In pN1 cases microcarcinosis was found as well as the metastases in 97 % and had no additional prognostic value.	2.4297161675173395
Microcarcinosis alone has a different significance from lymph node metastasis for prognosis.	2.194507872029864
This article summarizes the most important results of the Turku Conference on active strategies for an aging workforce, which took place in Turku/Finland in 1999.	2.0108755279604615
About 140 experts from all EU-member states participated.	2.090442597435275
The article can be seen as a contribution to the current change in the debate on labor market policy concerning older workers in Germany.	2.1927676681719652
The incidence of coronary artery aneurysm varies in the range from 0.2% to 4.9%.	2.521545378753543
We present the case of a 67 year old patient with coronary artery aneurysm and coexisting coronary artery disease of the right coronary artery.	2.737482367581496
The patient was symptomatic and had a posterolateral myocardial infarction.	2.1659504047385303
We performed a PTCA and stent-implantation of the stenosis and coronary artery aneurysm of the right coronary artery.	2.3271419907450626
After the procedure, the patient could be discharged without angina pectoris.	2.647560200853749
A control-angiography will be performed six months later.	2.293535529144753
TMLR (Transmyocardial laser revascularization) is a disputed cardiosurgical technique available in Europe since 1994 that aims to deliver additional blood flow to ischemic myocardium from the left heart chamber.	1.9210940339433207
Goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions: Are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels?	2.0813701355055203
We examined hearts of 10 patients who died during the first 18 days after TMLR.	2.512770854717994
Channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope.	2.392456326930286
Laser channels in the first days postoperatively have a lumen diameter of about 1 mm and are surrounded by coagulation necrosis about 500 µm thick.	2.0160860499217117
Despite phagocytic removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks.	2.0481361044151374
Open intramyocardial channels can be shown in all patients.	2.412000501022002
Our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood.	2.3839143284493067
Additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium.	2.114229528819329
However, our patients represent the small subgroup of the deceased.	2.312623165174492
If similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptomfree after TMLR remains open.	2.5050367553939203
Recurrent miscarriages are, like sporadically occurring miscarriage, often (approx.	2.03964882792356
50 %) due to chromosomal aberrations.	2.756094602338532
An undefined proportion of the other half may be due to immunological incompliances.	2.471609241159048
The basis for this assumption is the fact that the maternal immune system recognizes paternal antigens and rejects them.	2.129953486172387
The initial hypothesis that such immune reaction is due to a high similarity between the maternal and paternal HLA systems (HLA sharing) is most likely incorrect.	2.0756276979666146
Nevertheless, the incomplete recognition of the fetus by the maternal immune system and the resulting insufficient protection is basis for the active immune therapy with partner or donor lymphocytes.	2.0938815475022228
Several placebo-controlled studies have been performed.	3.0679892900976586
Due to the small number of cases, results were not significant.	2.6669860674739136
A metaanalysis of all studies, however, proves significant effects of the active immune therapy.	2.6309093625957334
The risks of active immune therapy led to the development of passive immune therapy with immune globulins (IVIG).	2.357209270763802
This therapy, however, is relatively expensive and obviously no more successful than the active immune therapy.	2.234668660861078
In a metaanalysis of all published results, IVIG was not significantly more effective than treatment with placebo.	2.2437947433925274
The indication for both forms of immune therapy is given after 3 or more consecutive abortions, after exclusion of other reasons for these abortions.	1.9953628700430197
It appears that only primary aborting patients are suitable for active immune therapy.	2.1382800003030775
Athough the concept of immune therapy is still under debate, alternative concepts are not available.	2.568501497422738
Hence, new therapeutic approaches are also not available.	2.5224018435827675
The first electronic implantable hearing aids for patients with hearing loss are coupled to the ossicular chain or perilymph during implantation and are now available.	2.2148925968961968
Our new Tübingen implant designed for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the combination of an implantable microphone and piezotransducer.	2.269541494857849
To avoid hearing losses during implantation, the Tübingen piezotransducer will be (1) fixed to the mastoid cavity and (2) positioned to one of the ossicular target points.	2.4339817318212087
This can be done with a micromanipulator which will be implanted together with transducer and microphone in the mastoid cavity.	2.033278829419668
The manipulator weights 0.7 g. With four degrees of freedom, it allows highly secure and safe positioning of the transducer's probe tip to the ossicular chain under close to stereotactic conditions.	1.8721745227801458
The main advantages of the present micromanipulator are (1) easy handling during surgery, (2) the transducer's precise positioning to the ossicular target point with sufficient degrees of freedom, and (3) the transducer's stable fixation in the mastoid cavity in the final position.	2.2697745270659153
Following integrated safety as the leading principle, ossicular or inner ear injuries caused, e.g., by the patient's head movement or unintentional manual contact by the surgeon, are minimized.	2.00387229977074
The micromanipulator is, as it were, the surgeon's vibration-free "artificial hand".	2.2144639057143514
The manipulator's development and its optimization to the mastoid cavity by test implantation in 50 human temporal bones are shown in detail.	1.9732532226162989
While coupling the transducer to the body of the incus, transducer, microphone, and micromanipulator can be implanted into 76% of all mastoid cavities without protrusion.	1.8927530902582577
In the case of transducers coupling to the long process of the incus, the protrusion-free implantation rate of the above-mentioned three implant modules is 78%.	2.029352307185315
The role of neuroimaging in the acute setting of head trauma is to diagnose the extent of intracranial injury and to identify all lesions which require urgent neurosurgical treatment.	2.070015214248118
Computed tomography (CT) remains the most important diagnostic tool for initial screening of trauma victims.	2.6525812546250878
Although magnetic resonance imaging (MR) has higher sensitivity to most traumatic lesions than CT, due to the ease and speed of CT, and the fact that sufficient monitoring of critically ill patients during the examination is much easier with CT than with MR, mean that MR is not the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnostic work-up.	2.310446229433812
Recent MR techniques such as FLAIR or diffusion imaging further improve the sensitivity of MR in head trauma.	2.0890059799924545
Conventional angiography is currently indicated only for few suspected vascular lesions (e.g.	2.035455013309988
traumatic arterio-venous fistulas, vascular dissections).	2.249712126657672
Injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are among the major injuries to the knee joint.	2.6840689409664837
Today we are often confronted with an inapproprate and delayed diagnosis of this injury and its concomitant lesions.	2.079270426084949
Additionally, the outcome of operative treatment has not yet reached an acceptable rate of satisfactory results.	2.3857126413741003
A further goal is to clarify diagnostic problems with respect to clinical examination and imaging techniques.	2.511847230534257
We also present a differential concept for the perioperative and conservative management of posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees in order to also adequately address concomitant injuries such as posterolateral rotatory instability and combined anterior cruciate ligament injuries with the aim of further improving results.	2.0589622298878445
Sevoflurane, like all currently used volatile anaesthetics, is degraded by carbon dioxide absorbents.	2.030206442295643
The most significant degradant is a haloalkene known trivially as "compound A".	2.036379285555327
Compound A is nephrotoxic in rats and, at higher doses, in nonhuman primates, causing proximal tubular necrosis.	1.986254527209716
There has been much interest in the potential for compound A toxicity in humans.	2.1567095258987394
Inhaled compound A concentrations are greatest at low flow rates, high sevoflurane concentrations, warmer absorbent, barium hydroxide vs soda lime, and drier absorbent.	1.7968869676905475
Typical inspired compound A concentrations during low-flow and closed-circuit sevoflurane anaesthesia in humans are 8-24 and 20-32 ppm with soda lime and barium hydroxide lime, respectively.	1.8818475960248133
Renal effects of compound A production during sevoflurane anesthesia have been examined in surgical patients and volunteers, using standard (creatinine clearance, serum BUN and creatinine) and experimental (urine excretion of protein, glucose, NAG, GST, AAP) markers of renal function.	1.7505874129527796
Investigations to date in surgical patients show similar renal effects of low-flow sevoflurane, low-flow isoflurane or high-flow sevoflurane.	2.525999744098124
There have been no case reports of compound A-associated renal injury in humans.	2.138198061256662
In volunteers, one study found changes in experimental but not conventional renal markers, while other investigations show no significant changes in either standard or experimental markers.	1.8769250346885784
The mechanism of compound A nephrotoxicity in rats appears to involve metabolism to glutathione and cysteine conjugates, and their subsequent renal uptake and metabolism by pathways that are different in rats and humans.	1.8024378658260856
In the report of the 1995 World Health Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, the definition of heart muscle diseases was updated.	1.6872144447091413
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of inflammatory cardiomyopathy are now recognized in this definition.	2.049399546443037
Enteroviruses, adenoviruses and cytomegaloviruses are considered as main etiopathological factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease.	2.313026217035494
We report our experience in managing a temporal bone fracture after head trauma that had no apparent clinical signs.	2.0306920364744583
Recurrent CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures.	2.147815042222362
Operative exploration of the temporal bone demonstrated a fracture line along the horizontal part of the carotid artery.	2.4627486894134645
The location of the fracture did not cause such typical symptoms as hearing impairment, facial paralysis, vertigo or tinnitus.	2.0508180259023034
Only CSF liquorrhea through the Eustachian tube indicated a fracture at the lateral skull base.	2.135493221858182
Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans (Flegel's disease) is a rare but clinically and histologically highly characteristic genodermatosis.	2.3148765382420673
We report on new immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings suggesting a complex disorder of epidermal differentiation.	2.0192728661195027
In this context, a good response to calcipotriol, a synthetic vitamin D3 derivative is of particular interest.	1.9630761258777258
Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially life-threatening event with uncharacteristic clinical manifestations.	2.3111491697673388
Diagnosis is commonly established by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography.	2.0953592148147195
Both methods, however, carry substantial drawbacks.	2.927875362289313
Therefore, clinicians claim that there is a need for an accurate and non-invasive diagnostic modality.	2.655935493181392
Spiral CT of the pulmonary arteries is a recent modality, that allows reliable visualization of emboli in pulmonary arteries up to fourth-order branches.	2.0310435787738754
This paper reviews the technical aspects, typical findings and diagnostic pitfalls of this recent technique.	1.96757342855057
The potential role of spiral CT in the screening of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism is discussed and selected cases are presented.	2.654616372350432
Introduction: Interleukin-12-p70 (IL-12-p70) is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine composed of a heavy chain (p40) and a light chain (p35).	2.2840382552215153
Contradicting results have been reported with regard to leukocyte release and systemic concentration of IL-12 after polytrauma.	2.79031159746034
Methods: We daily analyzed systemic concentrations of IL-12 in polytrauma patients (n = 37, mean ISS 33.9) in comparison to healthy donor values during intensive care course by ELISA.	2.081503627707264
Patients were divided according to their mean IL-12 levels into those with elevated IL-12 (group 1, n = 7), those with decreased IL-12 (group 2, n = 4) and those with IL-12 in the normal range (group 3, n = 26).	2.3616616483609154
Results: Patients in group 1 revealed elevated levels of IL-12 up to p70 > 1000 pg/ml and p40 > 2500 pg/ml.	2.303706671332871
The common clinical feature of group 1 was a thorax trauma in combination with pneumonia (85 % survivors).	2.232296293226577
Patients with single thorax trauma or pneumonia without thorax trauma (group 3) showed normal IL-12 values.	2.1043489539508786
Patients with decreased IL-12 levels revealed also a thorax trauma and pneumonia but all patients succumbed.	2.0331495774495987
Correlation analysis revealed no significant relation between systemically altered IL-12 values and clinical parameters, with the exception of a negative correlation of p70 and ISS (r = -0.785) or MODS score (r = -0.314) in group 1.	2.120571791256186
Conclusions: After major injuries there is no overall suppression of IL-12 formation.	2.621245007351009
Patients with normal or elevated IL-12 levels belong mainly to the survivors, whereas patients with decreased IL-12 levels are at high risk of succumbing to multi-organ failure.	2.0581642362351205
This article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome.	2.0356636629134206
Shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the coracoacromial arch, mainly in forward flexion of the arm.	2.139169904298353
Different stages of impingement syndrome are described.	2.3323197423971016
Stage I relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon.	2.2161205489328264
Stage II is characterized by bursal inflammation and fibrosis, as well as tendinopathy.	3.004113288423534
In stage III there is a tear of the rotator cuff.	2.7899601885268384
Moreover, calcifying tendinitis, fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome.	2.0664053753960516
Imaging is important for the exact diagnosis.	2.9274455188422914
Standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome.	2.542107660034494
They may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity, subacromial spurs, and form anomalies of the acromion.	2.0133561642833038
Ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors.	2.1430812725879305
However, there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears.	2.4299174319480104
Its usefulness has therefore been questioned.	2.5478734955341364
MR imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures.	2.7403913544689313
Several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings, such as tendinopathy versus partial tears, may be difficult with MR imaging.	2.3635846021558446
However, reproducibility for full-thickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography.	2.2972256959245256
Moreover, specificity appears to be superior to sonography.	2.7444239664280383
MR arthrography is not universally accepted.	2.4816168241648815
However, it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning.	2.233060337583567
Standard arthrography and CT have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff.	2.6749970239064322
Gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type (according to Ming) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only.	2.1973782617908575
Macroscopically they were classified as Borrmann IV or III, while histologically most of them were well differentiated.	2.269133305145335
Histologically, these tumours retained the pre-existing structures of the stomach, most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic, particularly in the submucosal and subserosal layers.	1.9881850755679324
In all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels.	2.0314978548509064
All but 2 cases with metastatically involved lymph nodes, often small, showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus; in three quarters of cases the serosa was infiltrated by the tumour.	2.0673045727378825
Significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom Billroth II operation had been performed.	1.899671597914136
The mean survival time of 16 patients was 14.9 months.	2.4003705705816945
Owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth, extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of signet ring cell cancer.	2.267325721617001
The high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging.	2.3607797510900177
Preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult, because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification.	2.2086602687535186
Close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary, and intraoperative assessment of the tumour - including frozen section of necessary - in particular is of the outmost importance.	2.1706780473488405
One rare case of so-called massive idiopathic osteolysis Gorham-Stout is presented.	2.274614120808012
In a 77-year-old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2.5 month following trauma.	2.292213659736486
As a histologic cause for the osteolysis, a marked stimulation of osteoclasts on the spongiosa, especially intracortically, was observed.	1.9290700249405441
The results suggest that an early antiresorptive therapy (calcitonin, bisphosphonates) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes.	1.9012096655201685
In this paper the relationship between psychodiagnosis and client-centered therapy is discussed.	2.1742483940466517
Rogers is wrongly said to have rejected any kind of diagnosis and that this therapy form has therefore developed an ambiguous relationship to this issue.	2.035957844588058
If one sees psychodiagnosis as something psychodynamic, and symptoms as defense strategies against underlying conflicts, then a comprehensive 'status diagnosis' using more or less traditional psychiatric categories appears compatible with theory-led client-centered diagnosis in the initial phase and during the course of therapy.	1.8368267102620022
Client-centered psychotherapy itself may be seen as a continuous process of dialogue in which 'assumed diagnoses' (embedded in the therapist's 'empathic knowledge') are jointly checked and in which the client through direct experience learns to understand and change his 'diagnosis'.	1.8167300611382018
In the examination of reversible segmental (articular) hypomobile dysfunction (blockage) of the spine, we have to recognize by palpation the feeling of beginning resistance at the end of the passive movement ("barrier").	2.1758656964175582
This is the main finding to diagnose segmental (articular) dysfunction.	2.1961871851929575
Normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end.	2.2240230567455352
In contrary, the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction, i. e. restriction of joint facet gliding.	1.9290047311769394
Multiple intra- and paraglandular lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland, including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations.	2.080973804921098
In the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes.	2.3326588633763836
Except for the frequently occurring Warthin tumours, primary salivary gland tumours, which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes, are rare.	2.294351944840309
Examples of these are adenomas (pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma) and carcinomas (acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma).	1.901796845513467
Three of our own observations (sebaceous lymphadenoma, acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma) are analysed.	1.9900120441388973
The condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour-free and that no other occult carcinoma is present.	2.1955374322008847
We report on a three month old infant presenting with vaginal bleeding.	2.069160306173312
Precocious pseudopuberty due to an autonomous ovarian cyst was diagnosed.	2.411944654949024
Within three months the follicular cyst spontaneously regressed.	2.349777652550285
Elevated estradiol levels also decreased spontaneously.	2.3704262908505647
The purpose of this study was to determine whether 24 hour patch testing with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) could reliably predict skin susceptibility to an irritant when compared with the alkali resistance test (ART), a widely used method employing sodium hydroxide.	1.9016466442221747
After having given informed consent, 40 patients (age range from 20 to 60 years) with an active irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), 40 patients in whom ICD had cleared, as well as 40 healthy volunteers serving as controls were tested.	2.249106846706959
The skin responses to SLS were assessed both visually and by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as an indicator of stratum corneum integrity.	1.859229104266938
SLS significantly increased the erythema scores and TEWL in patients with healed ICD, and the increase of TEWL was even more pronounced in patients with active ICD.	2.787501303094944
By contrast, a decrease in alkali resistance was found in patients with active ICD only but not in patients with healed ICD.	2.884216421071932
The data obtained indicate that the SLS test, unlike ART, may provide a non-invasive tool predicting a possible constitutional skin susceptibility or indicating a subclinically impaired epidermal barrier function.	1.9544081620512364
However, because of the relatively high interindividual variation, a cut-clear statement concerning the skin susceptibility cannot be made by this test.	2.132054762081389
On the other hand, the ART seems only to be useful for following and documenting the healing period following ICD.	1.972253769988587
Introduction: The correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of photoablation (PRK), while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy.	2.445260112991834
Experience has shown that cataract surgery, using modern tunnel techniques with self-healing incisions, results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing.	2.00344013293828
In this study, we attempted to combine the advantages of lamellar keratotomy with those of a pair-wise T-incision as arcuate lamellar keratotomy (ALK).	1.9183555454580492
An often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication, mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care, is reactive acute cholecystitis.	1.9858192952516236
On account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis.	2.3033373268000177
Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively, seven times on different days, in each of 40 artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of 12 months.	2.0009384595790833
The results show that artificial respiration, parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to tardive (28/40) wallthickening or to a three-layered wall of the gallbladder (9/40).	2.11727668544637
In 22.5 % of patients (9/40) we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis.	2.5429827166956134
In correlation with the clinical signs, cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients.	2.674690127731597
The preoperative ultrasonographic findings and clinical signs of 23 patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively.	2.668765867293621
We found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in 21 of these 23 patients.	2.2116600981109538
Our study shows that the morphological correlate of a thickened three-layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations, even if there is no underlying cholecystitis.	2.2329191155880563
The diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings.	2.3969733080548785
Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk.	2.4161347561842863
The purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	2.4759163411809277
Several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone, such as conventional radiography, high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).	2.6482790071842213
The best results were obtained using high-resolution tomographic techniques.	2.3923787613635152
The highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using HR-MRI.	2.0668675983827973
These studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion.	1.9521664643522643
Classification of cosmetics, which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents, is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists.	2.346897451576244
Their definition within the EU and the respective European directives, replacing national laws step by step, will be briefly presented.	1.861771403216377
The problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be discusssed in detail by examples from clinical practice.	1.8628739539163939
Finally, we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing "medicinally" active cosmetics, and in the pharmaceutical industry towards "cosmetically" oriented medicinal products as part of a current "life-style" ideology.	1.9212079457221414
In some clinical dermatological fields these active substances may allow the dermatologists to use cosmetics as topical therapeutic agents.	1.8895691630829876
The decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy.	1.9368372081922327
Especially in medical expert appraisements the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient.	2.2819700728110517
The purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative pathomorphologic shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases.	2.11210653948944
This study reports of 56 patients with rotator cuff tears which were devided in primarily acute, subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness.	1.8676050219869689
We considered the location of the tear, the shape and the size.	2.4580379543505226
Furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon, its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined.	2.1843107176527545
The results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not.	2.2010550477192794
The isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is siginificant for the trauma.	2.1971152558986513
In comparison with the degenerative study group the tenosynovitis and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study sigificant for traumatic tears.	2.122045189110211
Health care decision making in incompetent severely ill patients presents many difficult medical, ethical, and legal problems for the physician.	1.9884755634735896
At the same time nurses represent the group of medical professionals who have the closest contact with the patient and who have to carry out most of the decisions and instructions.	2.3792635090767034
Barber's disease is produced by short hairs that penetrate the interdigital spaces of the hands.	2.1758006902576232
The following chronic inflammatory reaction causes fistulas or sinuses and cysts.	2.0746467788064793
We present the case of a patient with interdigital pilonidal sinuses of all web spaces in both hands.	2.0556834396232655
Such an extensive case of this occupational disease has so far not been reported.	2.2726905521122833
The treatment of critically ill patients compromises frequently between an adequate fluid resuscitation for maintenance of a sufficient regional perfusion on the one hand and the avoidance of pulmonary edema on the other hand.	2.107622373025775
The application of the transpulmonary indicator dilution method allows the orientation of fluid therapy by using the parameters 'intrathoracic blood volume' and 'extravascular lung water'.	1.9662650125538474
This technique is less invasive than the pulmonary artery catheter since it only needs a 3 or 4 French catheter in the femoral artery.	2.0738183067985747
Additionally, controlling the fluid therapy with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is severely limited in the mechanically ventilated patient.	1.9593702443305445
Therefore, the intrathoracic blood volume may be of advantage in the critically care patient in comparison to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to assess the cardiac preload.	2.3280409738831738
Furthermore, the indocyanine clearance adds a valuable parameter to assess liver function when the double indicator technique is used.	1.8659426682513025
Hypnosis, autogenic training, progressive relaxation and biofeedback show good empirical evidence concerning relaxation-therapy and are useful techniques in psycho- or behavior-therapy.	1.8507296377834677
Though they share some aspects with body-oriented psychotherapy these relaxation-techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious meditation.	1.814587040578575
Though in details somewhat different, the methodology of these techniques creates a framework, in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited.	2.119986993934541
However, regular practice of the patients is requiered.	2.9054627532236132
Focussed attention, imagination and new attributions of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects, which may contribute to enhanced internal selfcontrol and selfesteem.	1.9530610420601078
Controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders (e.g.	1.9501347901567418
headache, pain, ess.	2.809120243973326
hypertension), as well as anxiety and sleeping disorders.	2.977215896072799
As components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs, there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders (e.g.	2.097378600308561
Relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific-based component in the treatment of psychic, psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders, except psychosis.	2.555991668045544
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in 1873 by Murray.	2.4008413769470143
Major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy; minor criteria include contractures, osteolytic lesions and a positive family history.	2.021543164552242
A 35-year-old woman suffering from Crohn's disease for 3 years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the dorsa of her hands and feet, as well as on her elbows and wrists.	2.1284492958283567
The clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum.	1.9894750649635833
No improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids.	2.8990624597254815
In contrast, treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions.	2.390548117598278
During a new attack of her Crohn's disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions flared again.	1.9845273354941302
The parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and Crohn's disease, as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases, strongly suggest a common etiology.	2.303219494109653
This hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature.	2.4418124436727595
Possible mechanisms are reviewed based on the work by others and ourselves on somatosensory reorganization in humans.	2.2718770393118435
The somatosensory system is characterized by divergent projections from the periphery to the cerebral cortex.	2.25902213558729
Changes in synaptic weights allow for reorganization of sensory processing: On one side, limb amputation will result in a representational "invasion" of the deafferentated cortex from neighboring regions with concomitant perceptual changes.	1.7774695479404834
On the other side, sensorimotor training can increase the representational cortical zone of a limb.	1.9996628130883294
Plastic changes can be temporary or persistent.	2.4292195166986614
Modulating factors like pain and certain drugs seem to induce a permissive state in the cortex resulting in enhanced reorganization.	2.004230615656236
Thus, specific physical training combined with pharmacoceutical modulation holds promise to improve functional recovery after brain lesions.	1.96567510327907
There have been some prospective randomized studies which compared primary angioplasty with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).	2.331830410173445
However, a substantial number of patients with AMI who would not have been included in those trials are treated with one of these two therapeutic options.	2.4414104668269245
To describe the proportions, characteristics, and outcome of these patients treated with primary angioplasty or thrombolysis we analyzed the data of the prospective "Maximal Individual Optimized Therapy for Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) trial.	2.1465657322143263
Chronic infectious diseases may run over many months and years, accompanied by only mild clinical signs and often without organ-specific symptoms.	1.9908628285032373
People with any kind of immuno deficiency are more frequently affected by chronic infections.	2.153518428819798
History, physical examination, laboratory tests, microbiological tests and imaging methods may lead to an exact diagnosis.	2.35356492649379
The most important differential diagnosis are autoimmune diseases, amyloidosis and malignant lymphoma.	2.0552406723444685
Background: We perform partial sphincterectomy during cataract surgery in cases with very small pupil (< 3 mm).	2.2165389252767866
We assume that the small pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the sphincter muscle.	2.24801187600151
Trauma scores in emergency medicine quantitatively characterise the severity of trauma victims' injuries and physiologic derangements.	2.34241676808603
They are used to detect and assess patients and have applications in guiding patient care and early therapeutic decisions.	2.1549592853658486
In the pre-clinical setting, an effective trauma index meets the following criteria: - It is highly reliable with regard to identifying high- and low-risk patients.	2.1690552101409555
- It has high face-validity.	2.2653044632135773
- It has high inter- and intra-rater reliability.	2.257456855757628
- It is easy to use and allows rapid, accurate measurements.	2.3266131509676318
The most widely accepted injury severity index is probably the Injury Severity Score (ISS).	2.122732792805054
It is calculated as the sum of the squares of the three most severely injured body regions, and was originally developed as a means to standardise the description of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents.	1.942833431842969
The Trauma Score (TS) represents the gold standard of physiologic scoring of injury severity.	2.2234120438366847
It summarises the numerical assessments of the central nervous and cardiopulmonary system functions.	2.278709283115385
The recently developed Mainz Emergency Evaluation Score (MEES) is based upon numerical specification of the vital signs, including a pain scale, and has been designed as a dynamic score.	1.9652040218658113
Nevertheless, limitations of the established trauma score systems have been described.	2.4806753084258317
Mortality and patient outcome do not strictly correlate with injury severity scoring.	2.1466881638868385
In addition, intubated or paralysed patients were excluded from outcome studies since the scoring systems lacked options for evaluation of pathophysiological conditions after therapeutic interventions.	1.827550649302751
Thus, therapeutic efficacy could hardly be assessed, and subsequent scoring during time periods was impossible.	1.9424979048803324
The accurate definition of comprehensive evaluation of a trauma victim is challenging, for example, "pain" as chosen in the MEES must be regarded as a highly desirable piece of information although its rating may prove difficult, especially when classifying unconscious patients.	1.9320034222218176
Further criticisms of the above-mentioned trauma indices could include omission of the trauma victim's age, gender, pre-injury health status, or the influence of alcohol or additional medication.	2.233294660061927
Moreover, questioning the interrater reliability of injury severity scoring, a recent study revealed bias in assigning values to trauma patients: trained raters classified injury severity with significantly higher indices than less experienced researchers.	1.7161306492434123
If trauma indices in pre-hospital emergency medicine were relied upon as the only means of evaluating a trauma patient and guiding therapeutic approaches, significant numbers of trauma victims requiring major interventions would be missed.	1.9339855316673302
Resuscitative treatment regimens must not be based solely upon indices, since, e.g., in states of shock injury scores do not correlate with fluid resuscitative requirements.	2.0350279728645635
Many multiple-trauma patients do benefit from controlled ventilation in clinical experience even though pulse oximetry values are within the physiological range, and the administration of analgesics or even pre-hospital anaesthesia has often proved advantageous for trauma patients in the field.	2.3194464352088486
Providing the opportunity of subsequent patient evaluation and the efficacy of acute care, the MEES has been developed as a dynamic scoring system.	2.402101488827954
This design is extremely desirable and must be regarded as an indispensible criterion for future scoring systems.	2.2207497952687394
In view of the peculiarities of field emergency medicine, pre-hospital indices do have limitations.	2.097249747153431
The parameters "unknown patient", time pressure, unprecise measurements, lack of diagnostic facilities, incomplete evaluation, and limited statistical power cannot be eliminated.	1.8956033265187318
Accurate prediction of outcome within early time-frames is therefore not possible.	2.0796488225650935
Ossification of the Achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic, hypoxic injury of the tendon.	2.7538246538411935
The usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma.	2.8039796728849766
We report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the Achilles tendon.	2.5834638544688575
Because of the radiologically "occult" fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by MRI.	2.1951725103886424
With a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery.	2.3511144297210325
Hair problems are attacked at the levels of information supply, trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment.	1.9807800049287527
They may pose a vexing problem for non-specialized physicians, who tend to trivialize such complaints, although the patient's perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought.	1.9330617523492364
Perception of a hair problem is subject to sociocultural standards; films and advertisements help determine the threshold for "normality" and what is "healthy" and "beautiful", and the media provide an abundance of undiscriminating information with respect to hair care.	1.99120806979432
Patients with hair problems frequently consult the hairdresser prior to the medical specialist.	2.2480664276743787
Thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser's training qualifications.	2.0600250727758747
Besides manual, creative and psychological aptitudes, "trichological competence" relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders, recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required.	1.9279681234147434
To optimize the interaction between the physician, hairdressers and the media, more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable, with success depending on full identification of the set goals, qualification and adherance to the standards determined by the medical speciality.	1.8738190978359082
We reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy.	1.9899192164923234
Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was SCLC before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two.	2.6540517354616115
Two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small-cell and adenocarcinomatous components, and five had only adenocarcinoma.	2.1337133202319745
The interval between histological evidence of SCLC and adenocarcinoma was 3 months-5 years.	2.0879253996120535
From the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in SCLC after chemotherapy: (a) a primarily heterogeneously differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy, and (b) an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of SCLC, as patients with treated SCLC are known to have an increased risk of non-SCLC.	2.0044762114952173
However, therapy-induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely.	2.2359705696905396
These findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of SCLC to allow early and appropriate reaction to non-SCLC components.	2.3918038639463095
Demonstration of BDV-specific serum antibodies, the isolation of BDV from cerebrospinal fluid of neuropsychiatric patients, and the recent demonstration of BDV antigen and BDV-RNA in human brain tissue strongly suggest that BDV can infect humans.	1.998378524681526
Isolation of BD virus from brain tissue is needed for final proof.	2.1706704511997033
There is still great controversy about the question of whether BDV antigen, BDV-RNA or BDV can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes or not.	2.1136121176765306
Overall, the question of pathogenicity of BDV infection for humans is wide open.	2.1874428944833793
Investigations of human cerebrospinal fluid indicate that BDV might cause human lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and so-called symptomatic psychoses in rare cases.	2.0100068909438584
Seroepidemiological studies suggest a widely non-specific but possibly pathogenic role of BDV in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders.	2.2848736121222553
In a controlled prospective study we compared the efficacy of combined salt water bath and UVA/B phototherapy to a UVA/B mono-phototherapy in patients with subacute atopic dermatitis (AD).	2.151498002751809
The patients in the balneophototherapy group (n=16) were treated with baths containing 3-5% of the synthetic salt Psori-sal, followed immediately by UVA/B irradiation, while the other treatment arm (n=12) received UVA/B phototherapy alone.	2.2156488589177235
After 20 treatments the balneophototherapy group showed a statistically significant (p<=0.0015) reduction of the SCORAD score from 69.5 before to 36.8 after therapy.	2.1298041465137505
No statistically significant reduction in the SCORAD score could be observed in the UVA/B phototherapy group (50.6 before to 44.3 after therapy).	2.234054164900148
The cumulative UVB dose was significantly lower in the balneophototherapy group (0.9 J/cm2) as compared to the UVA/B monotherapy group (2.0 J/cm2).	2.2516482828752564
Balneophototherapy was well tolerated by patients with atopic dermatitis and no side effects were observed.	2.450879363246998
We conclude that balneophototherapy expands the therapeutic options for patients with subacute atopic dermatitis.	2.386400901982249
Five percent of all human tumors are found in the head and neck region with an increasing rate.	2.5385687354580773
Head and neck tumors are not only a significant problem because of the large number of people affected.	3.0608334657678227
The functional and cosmetic disadvantages and stigmas related to the therapy influence the medical recommendations for each individual patient.	2.2776218684581124
Background and purpose: Only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt-PA for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been published.	2.449361492624537
Wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown, because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in stroke (ECASS and NINDS) did not formally assess the status of the extracranial vessels.	2.3936042349590094
Introduction: Chronic pain is an individually variable experience, incorporating physical, psychological and social dimensions.	2.0724996171717156
Chronic pain occurs in a broad spectrum of severity; therefore, a grading procedure is of crucial importance in clinical research and in epidemiologic studies.	2.1569654776453686
It is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability when treating shoulder instability.	2.1933023970495316
The traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions (Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs lesion, overstretching of the capsule), which are caused at the time of primary dislocation.	2.413350255908356
The quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the Bankart lesion.	2.754485058942161
The stronger the capsule, the greater the external force has to be in order to surmount the resistance caused by the capsule.	2.7470891436741773
The damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule.	2.429590167433557
In cases of atraumatic instability, secondary lesions are normally absent.	2.059559091208279
These instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule.	2.230496803750301
When stabilizing, a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration: stability and function.	2.4216219790966758
Reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability.	2.3945988021077422
Additionally, the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted.	2.3976307486356796
Both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation.	2.524960748975166
In benign goiter, thyroidectomy is only indicated in patients with nodular alterations of the complete thyroid gland.	2.4579039991463514
There is no evidence indicating that total thyroidectomy could improve the postoperative results in patients with Graves' disease.	2.384977800699241
However, there are no data to prove that this approach is superior to less radical procedures.	2.316765707977123
Avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative radioiodine therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy.	1.956289075888242
In patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected ret-proto-oncogene mutations, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation.	1.8735957248998918
The cervicolateral and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas.	2.361464167806653
In patients with medullary carcinomas, persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure.	1.9791462340711123
Thyroidectomy is an important part of the multimodal approach in patients with anaplastic carcinomas.	3.3627563806829817
The operative technique of thyroidectomy is presented as well as the technique of cervical lymphadenectomy in consideration of the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland.	2.5048472248988354
Tyrosinemia type I is an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase resulting in accumulation of tyrosin and its degradation products (succinylacetoacetone mainly).	1.8301182218596421
There are three main forms of the disease: the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age.	2.047402359734247
Experimental data and clinical as well as postmortem experiences have indicated that subdural hematomas are less frequent in acceleration injuries in traffic accidents compared to falls or assaults.	2.18285260845157
The present report demonstrates that this does not hold true in the same way for bridging vein ruptures (one of the predominant causes for subdural bleedings).	2.1199343555893346
Ruptures of these vessels without subdural bleeding (SDB) are only seldom mentioned in the literature.	1.9987986429554365
However, if no SDB is present, no one will look for these structures.	2.0751592682874564
In our institute a systematic analysis of the bridging veins in all cases of lethal blunt head injury is made: prior to the careful morphological preparation we investigate these vessels by radiographic imaging after filling with contrast medium.	2.0453320838894324
6 car passengers (age between 4 and 31 years) which suffered a lethal head injury were examined in the last year.	2.303037885363709
In 1 case the base of the skull was broken and in 3 cases no skull fracture was present; no serious focal brain injury had occured in these 4 cases, but 3 victims had signs of diffuse brain injury.	1.9798234100538323
In 5 cases a direct impact of the head against the interior of the car was obvious.	2.2759908009436454
In one case (survival for 3 days) a minor SDB (20 ml) was present and the ruptures had been closed by thrombosis; another victim died at the scene.	1.969721161060727
The other 3 victims survived between 4 and 15 hours without developing SDB and without closing of the ruptures by thrombosis.	1.9136266521266962
This combination is surprising and shows that our knowledge concerning the relationship between bridging vein ruptures and SDB is restrictred.	2.1075497533072256
The frequency of bridging vein lesions in severe head injuries is likely underestimated in the clinical as well as in the postmortem literature.	2.4061553159580686
A rapid increase of intracranial pressure after the accident resulting in a collapse of the cerebral circulation is probably responsible for the absence of the SDB in the presented cases.	2.4482058234175677
Implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear, provided they are fully implantable.	2.067491787969482
Accordingly, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, combined project was initiated at the ENT clinic of the University of Tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids.	1.9387138482192148
A novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described.	2.364176843324615
Unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far, this transducer does not rely on the bimorphic principle but on a circle-shaped, heteromorphic combination system consisting of a piezoceramic disc and metal membrane.	1.7814065681859
The transducer can be hermetically sealed and is designed for implantation into the mastoid.	2.0585879296051868
Transfer of mechanical oscillations to an ossicle in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements.	1.9190598275571615
The transducer is highly tuned with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range (greater than 10 kHz).	2.047236154683743
At low and middle frequencies of up to 1 kHz, these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound-pressure levels of around 90 dB SPL.	2.0329163051757746
At higher frequencies of up to 10 kHz, the output level increases to about 130 dB SPL.	2.231114680988933
Nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels (less than 0.1%) throughout the whole transfer range.	2.0409661243200476
Electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few microwatts and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems.	2.2696898868988233
Particularly, this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss.	2.1996463241625457
In craniomaxillofacial traumatology, surgical oncology and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction, a surgeon's aim may interfere with the prechiasmatic visual pathway.	1.891111296637944
Precise concepts and therapeutic strategies are mandatory to detect and deal with anterior visual pathway disorders.	2.245892418852681
In order to develop these strategies, knowledge of the pathomechanisms of potential optic nerve trauma, primary radiological investigations, and further diagnostic measures are important.	2.141285741508826
Due to the difficulties in neuroophthalmological testing of visual pathway functioning in severely injured patients or even during craniomaxillofacial reconstructions, we established flash-evoked visual potentials (VEP) and the electroretinogram (ERG) as reliable electrophysiological methods to gather specific information as to whether the visual pathway function is intact, even if pathological, but still present or absent.	1.7723859997381155
Case reports show that subjectively or objectively confirmed unilateral amaurosis does not neccessarily mean irreversible vision loss.	1.8160493291692137
The electrophysiological evaluation together with multiplanar computer tomography (CT) are important for the immediate identification of optic nerve trauma.	2.251698406555634
The results of this evaluation will provide the diagnostic information on whether surgical intervention and/or conservative therapy is required to prevent secondary optic nerve damage.	2.2008564563587893
and 5.4 mg/kg bodyweight/h i.v.	2.4842337919889097
for the following 47 h).	2.5085719887935736
Surgical therapy involves decompression of the orbital compartment in case of retrobulbar hematoma or decompression of the intracanalicular part of the optic nerve in the traumatized optic canal or posterior orbit as confirmed by CT.	2.0848469587791767
Prospective analysis of our trauma patients and the international literature on traumatic optic nerve lesions show that the time factor in when to start therapy has been greatly underestimated.	2.238830872135065
In the presence of preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes, and preterm maturation of the cervix, there is an increased risk for premature birth.	2.6192590875177086
There is a combination of endocrine as well as paracrine regulations which are responsible for the events associated with preterm labor, maturation of the cervix, and preterm rupture of the membranes.	2.47427877209622
Apart from classical hormones, various pro-inflammatory cytokines act as mediators.	2.150293982580007
At the fetal-maternal interface - which is formed by the placenta with the chorioamnion on the fetal side and the decidua, myometrium, and the cervix on the maternal side - an intense interaction between endocrine and immunological reactions has been observed.	1.9004953644375808
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone with multiple functions in humans, produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by -adrenergic receptors.	2.0866329474351724
Serum melatonin levels exhibit a circadian rhythm with low levels during the day, rise in the evening and maximum levels at night between 2 and 4 a.m.. Melatonin participates in the regulation of several physiological processes such as seasonal biological rhythm, daily sleep induction, aging and modulation of immunobiological defence reactions.	1.750447152148403
Furthermore, melatonin has a highly lipophilic molecular structure facilitating penetration of cell membranes and serving as an extra- and intracellular free radical scavenger.	1.8071307979250375
Melatonin seems to quench mainly hydroxyl radicals, the most damaging of all free radicals.	2.1507029671704934
Melatonin may play a role in the etiology and treatment of several dermatoses e.g.	2.7151289443384363
atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.	2.5057534472946164
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.	2.145055074834045
Topical application of melatonin inhibits the development of UV-erythema.	2.7011700039488087
Lung dust analyses were performed on tumor-free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors.	2.182319019817921
The measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients' occupation as stone mason.	2.37334122383938
No evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found.	2.6783227967837435
Analysis of 147 repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the Department of Surgery at the Herz-Jesu Krankenhaus, Fulda, from 1990 to 1995, showed that meniscal lesions were the most common (n = 89, 60.5%).	2.1550954265664894
The majority of meniscal lesions (n = 45, 50.6%) occurred in menisci that had already been partially resected.	1.9660049632718712
The most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions.	2.3171730008937685
Conversely, contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in 18 cases (20.2%), while de-novo lesions occurred in 29 cases (29.2%).	1.9328985922873219
A coincidence of meniscal injury with first- or second-grade cartilage damage was documented  in 35 patients (39.3%), whereas 54 patients (60.7%) had normal intra-articular cartilage.	2.009945575611551
Cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy.	2.611442359368919
The most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage-shaving.	2.024936534496483
Concerning patients' postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by OAK score, the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function (65.2%) and showed good or excellent outcome in the OAK score (88.8%).	2.302833281407172
Patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area (p < 0.05).	2.2208140158748164
However, patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit.	2.5426286613945113
The present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease-specific stress of eighty-six patients with psoriasis and fifty-eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the PsoriSol Clinic, Hersbruck, Germany.	1.9701725766690699
The clinical change was assessed by PASI and SCORAD, respectively.	2.2112354161358643
The Marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases (MHF) and a questionnaire for health-related control attributes (GKÜ-S) served as psychometric measures.	2.0158753365884223
Patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre-post comparison.	2.2828684612251857
Social fears, avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups.	2.1904227822898132
Patients with psoriasis also showed an increase in internal control attributes.	2.6056049431825707
Dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	2.7571183260434937
Treatment of chronic cancer pain with strong opioids is indicated in about 60-70 % of patients.	2.2558551703230405
Surprisingly, these very potent analgesics are prescribed with great reservations in many countries, including Germany.	1.9127927299673064
The aim of our investigation was to analyse the supply of opioid analgesics to outpatients with cancer pain in the region of Hannover, which has about 1.1 million inhabitants.	2.173109781163324
In Germany special prescription forms, i. e. triplicate forms, have to be used for the prescription of strong opioids.	2.672504084240293
At the time when our investigation took place prescriptions for outpatients had to be renewed every 7 days.	2.0789896127173213
For two observation periods of 6 months lasting from January to June 1988 and from January to June 1991 all of the opioid prescription forms that had been issued by general practitioners for clients of the AOK Hannover (one of the major medical insurance companies) were evaluated.	2.017183295519041
The reasons for prescribing opioids were analysed by recording the diagnosis.	2.2681842518988606
The individual treatment period on an outpatient basis during these 6 months was determined, excluding, e. g. days of hospitalization.	2.224823393618641
During the two observation periods only 16.2 % (1988) and 19.5 % (1991) of the practitioners in the region of Hannover prescribed strong opioids to outpatients.	2.0483379755096602
The majority of the practitioners consisted of general practitioners and specialists in internal medicine.	2.1875338298411173
Although these two groups mainly function as family doctors who are responsible for the basic therapeutical needs of their patients, only 22.6-33.8 % of these doctors prescribed opioids to outpatients.	1.9380695854481271
In two-thirds of the patients, cancer pain was the reason for prescribing the drug.	2.469316458103897
The total number of patients with a prescription for cancer pain was 164 in 1988 and 196 in 1991.	2.513391223969899
Altogether 1002 prescription forms in 1988 and 1065 prescription forms in 1991 had been issued for these patients.	2.0729867982524963
Applied to the individual treatment period as an outpatient, only 36.0 % of the patients in 1988 and 32.1 % in 1991 received a regular prescription of strong opioids every 7 days.	2.23585730008652
The mean time interval between separate prescriptions was 16.8  +/-  25.4 days in 1988 and 19.4  +/-  29.1 days in 1991.	1.8657681714696193
Accordingly, the majority of patients with chronic cancer pain had been supplied with opioids only occasionally.	2.585118315548644
Our data indicate a significant undertreatment of outpatients suffering from cancer pain.	2.164994662126276
Taking into account the estimated total number of patients suffering from cancer, only 14.5 % (1988) and 19.0 % (1991) of all outpatients in need of strong opioids were supplied sufficiently with those analgesics.	2.1239972997530345
Comparing the results from the observation period in 1988 with the results from 1991 it becomes obvious that the situation has not changed.	2.3234679359749006
There are different reasons for the insufficiency of opioid treatment: many physicians as well as their patients are still afraid of the side effects of strong opioids.	2.4288768712697504
Therefore, it is necessary to improve education concerning this issue.	2.505268975384968
The legal restrictions on the use of narcotics and their complexity are another important reason for doctors not to prescribe strong opioids.	2.077375337616261
In 1993 the regulations were simplified; nevertheless, this has not led to a profound change in the attitude of the prescribing practitioners.	2.16122189253646
Thus, further changes in legislation seem to be necessary so that the requirements for the prescription of strong opioids do not differ from other drugs.	2.2258423496901503
The long-term functional results of acetabular fractures are assessed in terms of the corresponding criteria of Merle-D'Aubigné and Postel (pain, mobility, walking).	2.2557995619515454
Other essential criteria include the quality of reduction and the radiological appearance.	2.745158646978738
A 53 year old female patient developed a keratoacanthoma, present on the left side of her nose for two months.	2.417148527522503
After repeated unsuccessful trials with cryotherapy, she was treated with intralesional injection of methotrexate performed twice with a weekly internal.	1.9740218576692745
This led to complete resolution within 5 weeks.	2.345137201172308
Although controlled studies on the effect of methotrexate in keratoacanthoma are not available, the rapid regression and the good cosmetic result suggest that this therapy may play a beneficial role in treating these lesions especially in problem locations.	2.1673701249076642
Between January 1995 and June 1996, 24 inpatients at our hospital (mean age 55.6 years) were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).	2.1680321997508045
Clinical improvement was observed in 80% of the patients, including those without risk factors (NRG, n=16), as well as those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases (RG, n=8).	2.55338243129568
During a mean period of observation of 224 days after the end of ECT 7 patients (35%) relapsed.	2.5110821234533676
The rate of relapse was higher in RG than in NRG patients (57.1 vs 23.1%).	1.9664675920650805
In all cases ECT was well tolerated; 285 applications of ECT did not result in mortality or persistent morbidity.	2.0285545805271323
However, RG patients may be at increased risk for the development of minor cardiovascular complications, which were noted in three RG patients (37.5%), but only in one patient (6.2%) in the NRG (Fisher's test, P=0.09).	2.516240393883686
Taken together, our results demonstrate that ECT is a safe treatment regimen for depression even in medically ill patients of old age.	2.1957843311063914
On 21.11.1811 the poet Heinrich von Kleist and his companion Henriette Vogel were found dead in a small hollow by the Wannsee.	1.8238222119389464
The autopsy revealed that Kleist was shot in the mouth and Vogel died from a close-contact shot to the chest.	1.8864568212378012
The tragedy, which was reflected in letters and documents ended in a suicide pact.	2.213222649905817
The conclusions of the pathologists were influenced by current medical opinions which were based on interpretations of the ancient humoral doctrine of Hypocrates.	1.8236197667301492
Subjective and objective opinions were mixed together.	2.323901415463791
Some forensic and historical aspects of this suicide pact are highlighted.	2.247489832521225
There is no doubt that a single emergency phone number is desirable, but in contrast to other countries, in Germany different emergency phone numbers and dispatching centers exist for the fire brigade (FB), the emergency medical service system (EMS), and the general practitioners' emergency service (GPS).	2.2041210713911354
Due to this fact, valuable time is often wasted by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another.	1.8372029244410208
The purpose of this study was to analyse all calls received by the different dispatching centers in the city and county area of Mainz with respect to total number, fraction of emergency calls, and specificity.	2.1047348180572665
Further, the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number (112) was calculated.	2.009820532605313
During a 4-month period, all telephone calls were registered and related to day, time, and origin of the call (city or county) and classified as non-urgent or emergency calls, calls appropriate to the dispatching center dialed, emergency calls to be transferred, or unspecific calls.	1.931418561516051
The EMS dispatching center received 31 286 calls, the five GPS-centers 15 256 calls; 1359 emergency calls that were directed to the police or FB needed transfer to the EMS.	1.7936811719422086
During weekdays the EMS and FB received the most calls, with a reduced frequency on Saturdays and Sundays (Table 2).	2.0141243520755325
Nevertheless, the highest total numbers of calls were received on Saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the GPS.	2.0087744105336056
The FB had the highest specificity of calls; more than 50% of the calls to the GPS were unspecific (Fig.	2.1204869618041857
Of all calls, 4.37% were classified as emergency calls; two-thirds of these came from the area of Mainz during the daytime.	2.186634889062232
During off-duty hours of the GPS in the city, 51% of the emergency calls reached the EMS directly; 49% had to be connected by the police or FB.	2.1488374564810213
During duty hours of the GPS, the fraction of calls directed to the EMS decreased significantly to 35%.	2.0414187884321637
During duty hours of the GPS centers in the county area, only 14% of the urgent emergency calls reached the EMS dispatcher directly (Fig.	1.7927467354911992
Compared to the multiple-center mode, a hypothetic single dispatching center for all systems would probably be followed by a slight increase in total number of calls due to the fact that the GPS numbers would be answered 24 h a day, but there would be only minimal differences in the total number received on most days; only on Sundays would a decrease be expected.	2.0027819111594805
The EMS area of Mainz, with a total of 13 different telephone numbers for 7 dispatching centers, can be regarded as typical of the German situation.	2.750194689057653
The high number of emergency calls to be transferred (up to 86% under special circumstances) demonstrated that this weak point in the German EMS system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number.	2.0132563683160707
This should occur when a Europe-wide three-digit number "112" will be instituted, probably in 1995.	1.8479346454347012
Additionally, the continued existence of 5- or 10-digit telephone numbers for non-urgent calls may be useful for allowing non-verbal differentiation of calls.	2.0586717715612597
In any case, all telephone numbers, including the latter calls, have to enter one dispatching center.	2.3136871888197046
In addition to elevated intraocular pressure, a compromised ocular blood supply has been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (PCOG).	1.9633681508680536
The ongoing change of demographic and economic structures does not undermine employment (as many believe), but this change indeed induces problems with the mandatory old-age security system in Germany.	1.8927240392174862
This paper discusses some popular reform proposals and concludes with another proposal which takes into account economic incentives.	1.8030802236261154
It was described first by A. Warthin in 1895 in "Family G" and is characterized by a predisposition to an early onset of colorectal cancer and other intestinal or genitourinary tumors.	1.9757266144516514
We report the case of a 61-year-old woman with five different cancers.	2.29374421279132
Although the strict Amsterdam Criteria were not fulfilled, molecular analysis revealed HNPCC; further genetic testing in the family confirmed that the 36-year-old and so far healthy son had inherited the germline mutation of his affected mother.	1.8816225674673952
Genetic testing in clinically suspected HNPCC cases is recommended for patients with colorectal cancer meeting the Amsterdam Criteria.	2.4257006982881855
In patients meeting one of Bethesda Criteria 2-7 without meeting the Amsterdam Criteria, germline mutation analysis is recommended only in MSI-positive tumors.	1.8034126032228739
Introduction: The Pura-Vario stent features 2 newly designed "bridging segments" for enhanced longitudinal flexibility, in order to allow easier and safer stent implantation.	1.8946526207291896
The median palatine suture has long been regarded as having the greatest resistance to dilatation of the maxilla.	2.03202266121011
An orthodontic apparatus cemented in place preoperatively is already used intraoperatively for dilatation of the maxilla.	2.0174899948776512
In the period from 1991 to 1997, 16 patients with a leptomaxilla and various dysnathic findings have been operated on at our clinic by the method described by Glassman [3].	2.4324693311994334
Sometimes the maxilla was dilated intraoperatively using the apparatus cemented in place by the method of Derichsweiler and dilatation was continued postoperatively until the described result was achieved.	2.001044239488813
After successful dilatation of the maxilla and a stabilizing phase, a mono- or bimaxillary operation was performed.	2.1660384374407027
The use of this method led to the desired result in 15 patients.	2.7557279383013156
Dilatation of the maxilla was objectivized by determining the pre- and postoperative width of the anterior and posterior dental arch using models and X-ray of the occlusal overlay of the maxilla.	2.33063928189098
In one patient who was operated on at the age of 38 years, a fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla occurred unilaterally due to the completed ossification of the median palatine suture.	2.659129017966649
In older patients, the median palatine suture should be transsected as well.	2.511856725445373
Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease.	3.324965652070648
In addition to known risk factors e.g.	2.1898798942559567
genetics, age and hormonal status it has been suggested that chronic-repetitive micro- and substantial (macro-) injury may play an important pathogenetic role.	2.0806557677514292
In a longitudinal case-study we examined Judo-players for clinical and radiological changes of the finger joints over the course of 16 years.	2.3385520002361107
Arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication following vascular trauma.	2.8324120801790786
We report a case of an arteriovenous fistula of the neck after a penetrating injury.	2.3166954822631483
The only presenting symptoms were a thrill and a machinery murmur.	2.0514622915761236
There were no signs of cardiac insufficiency.	2.3839661174403552
Duplex scan and arteriography detected an arteriovenous fistula between the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein.	2.2233346088695045
Treatment should be carried out as soon as possible, and is then usually simple and successful.	2.5337906014400944
Pathogenesis: Arteriosclerosis and Mönckeberg's disease mediasclerosis are vascular diseases associated with calcification of the artery wall.	1.9617330569888605
While mediasclerosis in most cases develops in type 2 diabetic patients, arteriosclerosis is the result of a combination of different vascular risk factors.	2.3904550701951592
Möncheberg's mediasclerosis typically involves the tunica media, whereas arteriosclerosis-associated calcifications primarily involve the intima.	1.9277485025489738
The new technique of non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) sialography was evaluated for normal and various pathologic conditions of the parotid gland.	2.361142138617926
Ten volunteers and 15 patients with various symptomatic diseases of the parotid gland were tested in the present study.	2.7225525776841026
In addition to the usually performed T1 and T2 cross-sectional sequences a heavily weighted T2 sequence (TR 3600, TE 800) was performed and allowed depiction of a fluid-filled parotid duct.	1.8111692882627168
Results showed that the main parotid and primary branching ducts were depicted reliably in all normal cases and all patients, except one with sicca syndrome.	2.123442367011455
Pathological conditions such as duct dilatations, duct strictures, obstructing duct calculus and irregular shapes and courses of the ductal system were demonstrable.	1.7692435493914977
While X-ray sialography obtained a higher resolution, only MR sialography was able to depict dilated ducts proximal from a complete obstruction, as well as all ductal cysts.	2.2507841552452272
Our findings show that MR sialography can be applied successfully to investigations of the parotid gland system.	2.235196722166149
There have been no contraindications or complications to date because MR sialography is non-invasive.	2.1737472154759594
The technique will also allow the salivary ducts and lesions to be differentiated from the course of the facial nerve.	2.3345683153201415
Substantial improvement in conformal radiotherapy is possible using modulated irradiation fields.	2.1331705495435624
Such modulated fields may be generated even with conventional accelerators by means of individual metal compensators or with the recently available dynamic multileaf collimators (MLC).	1.927379069192301
For treatment planning a new kind of planning program is required that can calculate the 2 D-intensity matrices for each photon field.	1.8989815040996068
At the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) such a program has been developed under the name of "KonRad" (Conformal Radiotherapy).	1.8756432582697233
Although it is an independent application, it is proposed for clinical usage to supplement a planning system that is already present.	2.2607847230374047
So-called inverse planning differs from conventional 3 D planning, as the trial-and-error approach for finding good field parameters is nearly completely avoided.	1.930314895325558
Instead, the radio-oncologist is given the chance directly to specify medically oriented criteria like the prescription dose in the target volume, maximal tolerance dose values for each organ at risk and their weighting factors.	1.8560202050863972
In addition, the so-called DVH optimization allows aimed, partial overdosage, especially in parallelly structured organs in order to obtain better overall planning results.	2.164149957710438
The Problem Six-year old boy with unilateral Type-II cleftfoot, oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd toe.	2.175651830911981
The marked splaying of the forefoot not only causes painful pressure points but also problems with fitting of shoes.	1.9288338697301128
A child with typical signs of the cat eye-syndrom except the characteristic feature of a cat eye is reported.	1.9255283742599274
In a chromosome analysis (47,xx, + mar de novo) an extrachromosome was detected.	1.8627037122010408
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the supernumerary marker refered to chromosome 22.	2.0558217100887592
In the literature only a few cases show all the characteristic features of cat eye syndrome.	2.2441452937346527
However, there are only two case reports of children without any ocular alterations.	2.3821773575642244
The great variability in the phenotype probably depends on different sizes of the marker chromosome or asymmetric breakpoints on the long arm of chromosome 22.	1.9403974307174998
According to new literature reports there is no correlation between the phenotypic variability and the size of the marker chromosome.	2.4232849053734187
Probably the degree of severity is correlated with the percentage of the patients lymphocytes that contain the extrachromosome.	2.8270666118080245
Introduction: Children with ALL frequently present with skeletal pain at the time of diagnosis.	2.2285845538360087
We retrospectively analyzed the incidence and clinical features of skeletal pain and the correlation between pain and radiographic findings.	2.4178103381994998
Objective: Elevated levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been reported after cardiac operation, during inflammatory process and cardiac allograft rejection.	2.6006323349177864
Although several groups proved the evidence of a negative inotropic effect, the actual mechanism is not completely understood.	2.2192464236020317
Speaking generally it is possible that low molecular weight proteins are capable of altering myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	2.1463149175980156
Therefore this study analyzes whether IL-1 and/or IL-6 influence myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	2.4612893629731767
Methods: During aorto-coronary bypass operation, human muscle fibers were excised (n=32) and skinned using Triton-X-100.	1.8923919093152082
The experimental skinned fiber model excludes membrane-related factors such as receptor activation and provides direct examination of the contractile apparatus itself.	2.103358067036793
Different concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 were applied (pIL-1/IL-6 1-2x10-5-10-11M).	2.2441417442806695
Force generation, calcium sensitivity, and velocity of force generation and relaxation were measured.	2.0677284539081544
(Experiments were carried out at optimal length, bath temperature 23 °C, and isometric conditions.)	2.0899977237559018
Results: None of the skinned muscle preparations of the human myocardium showed under the given experimental setup a significant change in contractility and relaxation after exposure to IL-1 and IL-6.	2.0437310823904857
Despite using nonphysiologic concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 (pIL-1/IL-6 10-5M) no significant effect occurred.	2.179409894431693
Furthermore no difference in calcium-sensitivity of the contractile proteins following addition of IL-1 and IL-6 could be observed.	2.4349707404380303
Conclusions: Thus, there is no experimental evidence for direct modulation of the contractile apparatus by IL-1 or IL-6.	2.5166257592920913
Given these results it is possible to exclude some potentially negative inotropic cascades that are mediated on the level of the contractile apparatus as the molecular mechanism.	2.1393321924004733
These data show that therapies which support myocardial contractility during sepsis by stimulation of the contractile proteins do not seem to be very promising.	2.3010495943398577
Indications for intercarpal and radiocarpal resectionarthroplasty and fusions are osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK'S disease, rheumatoid arthritis and several posttraumatic disorders of the wrist joint.	1.952397088539869
The resection of carpal bones leads to severe instability patterns of the wrist.	2.2536203867468823
In conclusion we recommend resection-arthroplasty just for treatment of the thumb carpo-metacarpal osteoarthritis.	2.2506779201550104
Implant resection arthroplasty of the lunate and scaphoid or total wrist implants are still causing multiple problems regarding heavy load.	1.982196378524093
Therefore this implants should be confined to rheumatoid patients.	2.303366525026015
Of the limited carpal arthrodeses the scaphotrapezium-trapezoid arthrodeses is the most frequent performed procedure.	2.22435706061136
It can be indicated for STT-osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK's disease, scapho-lunate instability and scaphoid pseudarthrosis if other surgical procedures had failed presuming there are no signs of arthrosis in the radiocarpal joint.	1.8579236402756316
Persisting pain especially in heavy work is quite frequent after limited arthrodesis but can be greatly releaved by simultaneous wrist denervation.	1.8661783500723357
In advanced cases of osteoarthritis total wrist arthrodesis is still the best choice for the patient.	2.3951950073510067
Increasing numbers of monitors at the anaesthesiologist's workplace, providing more than 20 different parameters of the patient's condition, have already made it impossible to record all the values in a handwritten form.	1.9935079335972663
Consequently, this most common method of record-keeping must be incomplete and inaccurate.	1.9992465555933212
In recent years computerised data-acquisition systems have been introduced into clinical practice in order to produce more reliable records.	2.392316677318448
But after a 7-year experience in the use of such a system in cardiac anaesthesia, we have recognised certain problems that remain to be solved before automated record-keeping will achieve wider acceptance.	2.1963006245439356
The first is the handling problem, which was discussed in a previous paper [11].	2.3377844353550983
The second major problem is the appearance of artifacts, caused mainly by mechanical manipulations during the operation.	2.2651839842949926
Algorithms were developed for each haemodynamic parameter to suppress these artifacts automatically by a subsequent analysing process; the efficiency of that "artifact filter" was validated in 35 of the 300 cases.	1.908314495774951
Based on more than 30,000 values for each parameter, the incidence of artifacts was 3%-7%.	2.4138507522406694
However, only 0.1%-0.5% of the artifacts could not be eliminated by the filter.	2.2503744869070084
The method described here provided acceptable graphic printouts of the most important haemodynamic parameters (Figs.	2.3164598867665562
1b and 2b) and would also be suitable to serve as an input filter for automatically running anaesthesia data-examination processes, which are currently being developed in our clinic.	2.1576852358646272
Extracorporal shock wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	2.0585336338811717
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of the ESWA on the treatment of soft tissue disorders.	2.425093526547244
83 patients who underwent medicophysical treatment without benefit were treated with 3000 impulses of 0,30 mJ/mm2.	2.353207081860525
Follow-ups after 12 weeks and 12 months showed that 51 of 83 patients became pain-free and 20 patients improved from the treatment.	2.1712802200537307
The results are showing the benefit of the high energy extracorporal shock wave application in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.	2.569737937947953
In developed countries, medical conditions, rather than lack of food, are the main contributors to malnutrition.	2.1405141545392934
Undernutrition is especially common in older persons, occuring in 5-12 % of community-dwelling older persons, in 30-61 % of hospitalized older persons, and in 40-85 % of persons in long-term care institutions.	2.2401192118922406
The multi-factorial nature of undernutrition in the elderly forces a structured differential diagnostic approach to determine underlying causes.	2.121500900761191
Heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment is imperative to prevent the sequalae of undernutrition.	2.0745777657312656
This structured approach to the differential diagnosis is essential to evaluate potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.	2.633900596589089
The number of surgical procedures performed as day surgery has significantly increased in recent years.	2.1893287410713844
Therefore, a safe and short postoperative recovery period has become increasingly important.	2.2060774775433583
The aim of the present study was to investigate perioperative cognitive and physiological function after oral premedication with low-dose midazolam (3.75 mg), especially during the postoperative period.	2.0779980536288636
Heart failure may be defined as a reduced physical per-formance frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contraction.	2.316786763026363
According to the New York Heart Association, the severity of heart failure is classified into four grades (NYHA I-IV).	2.0705794699160722
Predominantly underlying causes are coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies and valvular heart diseases.	2.189078164188741
Psychic disorders were studied with a naturalistic design in 125 consecutive patients of a medical-geriatric department in a general hospital.	2.1026112294794466
Based on the clinical examination and the values of the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (2), 51 patients were classified as unable for diagnostic procedures concerning psychic state.	2.372662173609206
The other 74 patients underwent these diagnostic procedures including clinical investigation and three screening-scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11); Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Scale (4)).	1.8787697434392407
If these examinations led to the suspicion that a patient suffered from a psychic disorder, an interview was performed by a psychotherapist with experience in gerontopsychosomatic treatment and information was collected from the medical and nursing staff.	2.2602986450015585
Dementia was detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.	2.2549963496519116
The screening instruments turned out to be reliable, so they can be recommended for further use.	2.339522528985144
Difficult to answer remains the question, how the treatment of the psychic disorders - in our sample necessary for each 5th to 6th patient - can be implemented in a medical-geriatric department.	2.275460073741687
Based on the "Trauma Registry" of the German Society of Trauma Surgery, an interclinical quality management (QM) system was implemented.	1.9814175255701647
The principles of the QM system as well as the differences in the quality of outcome and treatment are presented.	2.91495931477039
The analysis uses the data on 2,069 severely injured (ISS = 22  +/-  14) patients from 20 hospitals collected prospectively and anonymously between 2/93 and 12/97.	1.86498819397772
The Z-value of the whole series was -0.24.	2.501057819641198
The assessment of treatment quality was performed by criteria concerning both preclinical and acute clinical phases.	2.1460003117687583
Clinic C had a prolonged preclinical treatment time (90 min vs 62 min in clinic A) for severely injured (ISS > 15) patients.	1.9969040360759356
At the same time, the preclinical intubation rate for severe thoracic trauma (AIS > 3) was lower (44 %) in clinic C than in A (62 %).	2.03689916699751
With 14 min clinic A had the shortest time until basic radiological and ultrasound diagnostics were completed (X-rays of chest and pelvis and abdominal ultrasound) in cases of severe blunt trauma (ISS > 15), compared to 54 min in clinic B or 31 min in clinic C. Also, cranial computed tomography for severe traumatic brain injury (GCS < 9) was applied significantly faster in clinic A (after 36 min) than in clinic C (after 62 min).	1.8670260877984235
For invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media (CM) with excellent tolerability are available.	1.86872040359813
The governing practical factors for CM are X-ray opacity and biocompatibility.	2.3675598742367057
Tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity, osmolality, and ionic concentration.	1.9883442275459817
In Germany the nonionic CM are currently preferred.	2.1791099810428998
Because of its low thrombotic complications, the ionic CM Ioxaglat is an important alternative in high risk interventions.	2.242567180663313
In patients with known CM incompatibility, the prophylactic application of H1-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications.	1.954742634738408
In impaired renal function, hydration is the most effective prophylactic measure to be taken.	2.5973973177545937
Background: In the present study we evaluated the influence of topical miotics on intraocular pressure and the blood-aqueous barrier after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and PC-IOL implantation.	2.086407802246543
A judgement on the patient's quality of life cannot be based solely on the information about the clinical severity of a disease.	2.501207570269549
Very often there is no correlation between these parameters.	2.869584612366681
It is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question-naire since non-life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much.	2.4961802564016247
The most frequently used questionnaires are the SF-36 and the Nottingham Health Profile.	2.125679212034099
However, these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately.	1.993955412440246
Therefore specific tools such as the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) and Skindex have been established for dermatology.	2.143258775449469
Further disease-specific questionnaires have been created to mea-sure time related changes in dermatological patients.	2.056537401898181
We surgically treated twenty patients with axillary hyperhidrosis by liposuction using tumescent regional anesthesia.	1.9286532817262902
After a description of the surgical technique results are presented.	3.0324538522734454
Except for trivial hematomas, no complications were seen.	2.4078009012650714
Every patient noted a significant reduction of sweat gland activity in the follow up period.	2.467803692446288
Long-term results remain to be seen.	2.6987393505782555
The value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).	2.4473763781789932
Clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38/69 cases (55 %).	2.6779054128588733
The chromosome aberrations, especially complex changes, were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as atypias of the haematopoietic cell lines and myelosclerosis.	1.8746826284194864
Complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the MDS patients.	2.1460855464376194
Our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in supplementing the histopathological diagnoses.	2.1206792186124837
Recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non-dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis.	2.0087451152503406
In the course of 1 year, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and therefore may be very harmful in frail elderly people, was diagnosed in six patients of a geriatric clinic.	2.24282266535077
The disease is associated with antibiotic therapy, due to an overgrowth of the intestinal flora with Clostridium difficile.	2.6825098627763255
Symptoms varied from a state of asymptomatic carriage or benign diarrhea to acute stages of the disease with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and acute phase response.	2.0540427306592397
Diagnosis of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea was established when, in addition to typical clinical symptoms, a toxin-positive stool specimen was found.	2.108822974412266
Oral vancomycin was effective in all cases, leading to a stop in the diarrhea and an amelioration of systemic inflammatory parameters.	2.2540046839116696
This report analyzes 46 cases of personnel-to-patient transmissions of hepatitis B (HB), hepatitis C (HC) and HIV in health care settings.	2.0822354668575738
Similar circumstances were found for transmission of HB (40 cases, 404 infected patients), HC (4 cases, 224 infected patients) and HIV (2 cases, 7 infected patients).	2.105874167578696
Cases with the highest number of transmissions (one anesthesiologist with 217 HC transmissions, and one EEG technologist with 75 HB transmissions) were attributed to poor infection control practices.	1.8172492025850584
As long as infected health care workers (HCW) adhere to general infection control measures, a risk for transmission to patients exists only from infected surgeons who perform'xposure-prone invasive procedures'.	1.7323804589756495
Whether changes in duties of infected HCW are necessary should be decided on an individual basis.	2.0041885532490746
Often, the infected personnel were assumed to have acquired the disease occupationally.	2.1537376802086654
Medical practices and devices bearing a risk of infection should constantly be reviewed with regard to risk for patients and personnel.	2.451859862239635
The healthy newborn infant also has the right to optimal monitoring in order to detect any disturbance in postnatal adaptation as early as possible.	2.1126131328892854
The introduction of painless, simple, and yet reliable methods, e.g., pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening, has considerably improved the situation for obstetricians and midwives.	1.8814441007234806
Injuries of the spine in children rarely occur.	2.674786430105209
They amount to about 0.2 % of all fractures and dislocation and to 1.5 to 3 % of all lesions of the spine.	2.3844029030856237
The younger an injured child is, the more likely it has sustained a lesion of the upper cervical spine.	2.270094926039689
This spinal segment in comparison to adults is concerned more often and accounts for 50 % of all C-spine injuries.	2.2380440248589366
Important differences between the adult spine and the spine in the child disappear with the age of 10 years.	2.7221491969942373
Later diagnostics, classification and treatment correspond widely with the principles valid in adults.	2.0579171163120566
The knowledge of the normal shape and development of the spine are crucial in avoiding misinterpretations of X-ray films.	2.7658501964260926
Typical examples include the confusion of synchondrosis with fractures or of subluxations of the atlas and the C2/C3 segment with "true" instabilities.	1.8247361307510273
Although a variety of histologic entities were described, primary tumors of the trachea are rare findings.	2.536099200406074
Over a period of 20 years, 30 patients underwent 31 tracheal resections in two hospitals for thoracic surgery.	2.1187439108399695
Among them 4 patients had thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea.	2.2192339560726135
In these patients a strumectomy combined with tracheal resection was performed.	2.1567029202740713
One re-operation for erosion bleeding of the innominate artery on the 8th postoperative day was successfully performed.	1.9843771657726863
All patients showed excellent long-term survival.	2.79702928817638
Principles, methods and results of percutaneous therapy in acute and chronic vascular alterations of the subclavian artery and its branches.	2.317247468723026
Speculations concerning a possible association between temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and ear symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus have been made in the dental and medical literature for a long time.	1.9968017653604828
Current understanding of this association is reviewed.	2.370018058907757
An analysis of relevant studies published between 1947 and 1996 shows that a relatively high percentage of TMD patients reported the presence of ear pain and noise.	2.1127370143007367
However, a cause-effect relationship has not been established to date.	2.413012889796607
Theories that try to explain the concurrence of TMD symptoms and ear symptoms (particularly tinnitus) by a common underlying cause remain speculative.	1.966313596738779
It has to be taken into consideration that due to their high prevalence, TMDs and ear symptoms in a given patient may be present by chance alone.	2.349459292158819
A methodological weakness of most of the studies available is the fact that control groups were not considered.	2.5735244601557636
Owing to the lack of prospective, controlled, and randomized studies, statements regarding the effectiveness of certain dental measures for the treatment of otalgia and tinnitus in TMD patients are not well supported.	2.248270499658201
Our report describes a 46-year-old woman with self-inflicted oedema of the left leg and the left arm.	2.6347869315356216
She induced leg oedema by an elastic bandage tourniquet and arm oedema by holding her arm dependent and immobile.	1.8217223339143556
A preexisting disorder of the affected leg (postthrombotic syndrome) and of the affected arm (hypoesthesia subsequent to surgical injury of the plexus brachialis) delayed the diagnostic proceedings.	2.304881714601315
Our case report shows that: -  Confirmed presence of organic disease does not exclude limb oedema of self-inflicted origin.	1.9643499073314186
-  Oedema resulting from a tourniquet and "hysterical oedema" can be developed by one and the same patient.	2.0782707685942414
-  Effective care of such patients is only possible if dermatologist and psychiatrist work together all the time (liaison psychiatry).	1.962224454505068
Purpose: This study was conducted to control improvement in the high preoperative prevalence of TMJ symptoms in patients treated by long-term orthodontic therapy for class II malocclusion.	2.582079857649755
Patients and methods: A total of 57 patients were examined at least 8 years after surgery, 37 having received orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery and 20 surgery but without orthodontic treatment.	2.18294919742274
Myofunctional, disk and condylar symptoms were recorded according to the Krough-Poulsen scheme.	2.2665055901415037
Results: Both groups showed a normal maximal interincisal distance.	2.3079894263297485
The deviation during the opening movement was mainly sigmoidal in the group with orthodontic treatment and terminal in the other group.	2.2110628067005313
Muscular pain predominated in the group without orthodontic treatment.	2.503422798302589
Clicking sounds of the TMJ were registered in 70% of both groups.	2.413833300395843
Occlusal interference and a higher interocclusal distance when speaking were found more often in patients without orthodontic treatment.	2.2246375479951737
Preoperatively, clicking and crepitation sounds had been recorded in 60% of both patients groups.	2.10177562399029
Conclusion: In conclusion, a high postoperative prevalence of TMJ dysfunction symptoms was found in patients with class II malocclusion 8-10 years after orthognathic surgery with or without orthodontic treatment.	2.6086289857628455
Both groups often exhibited TMJ clicking and crepitation sounds, whereas the patients that had not received orthodontic treatment had a higher prevalence of occlusal interference and muscular pain.	1.9343414287051213
The synthesis of pS 2 protein is induced through estrogen-dependent transcription of the pS 2 gene.	2.002110083492116
The presence of the pS 2 protein in breast cancer is thought to be as valuable as receptor status, or even more so, in predicting the response to hormonal therapy.	2.1079965608688824
Furthermore, pS 2 appears to be a prognostic factor for primary breast cancer.	2.5577519690649884
In 162 cases of primary breast cancer, pS 2 was tested by immunohistochemical procedures on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues.	2.078952274760376
Staining was evaluated semiquantitatively using an immunoreactive score (IRS).	2.1826508620631446
The concentrations of pS 2 in tumor cytosol were determined using an immunoradiometric assay.	2.107055918270391
Positive staining for pS 2 (IRS >= 2) was seen in 27 % of the tumors.	2.3907075723054083
Comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection (26 % of tumors had pS 2 cytosol concentrations above the cut-off value of 26 ng/mg cell protein) revealed an 81 % concordance rate (r = 0.76; P < 0.0001).	1.7678733912167321
Univariate analysis showed no significant correlation of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection and age or menopausal status of patients, tumor size, tumor grade or nodal status.	2.1587559475127494
However, the immunohistochemical pS 2 status correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen (ER; P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor status (PR; P < 0.0001).	1.973765581062551
pS 2-positive tumors were ER-positive in 66 % of cases and PR-positive in 73 %; 89 % of pS 2-positive tumors were positive for ER and/or PR.	2.1640557660728774
The incidence of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection was 41 % in the group of steroid receptor positive carcinomas (ER- and/or PR-positive) in contrast to 7 % in steroid receptor negative tumors (ER- and PR-negative).	2.058067450834879
Patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting may develop acute myocardial infarction late after surgery.	2.3258259436233235
It is not exactly known in these patients whether acute infarction is predominantly caused by occlusion of bypass or native vessels.	2.0734944259857992
Also, there is no systematic and prospective data available with respect to an invasive, revascularizing therapeutic approach.	2.5641601652010855
Therefore, acute coronary angiograms were obtained in 21 consecutive patients with acute infarctions and remote bypass grafting to elucidate mechanisms causing myocardial infarction in these patients, and to assess results of catheter-based recanalization.	2.5076735450474983
We report the clinical and laboratory results of a family where one boy and one girl presented with a clinical picture resembling the X-linked agammaglobulinemia known as Bruton's disease.	2.282051776826714
Both children showed severe bacterial infections starting at the age of around 6 months, a lack of all immunoglobulin classes and absence of mature B-cells in the peripheral blood.	2.2444100590595046
With respect to reports from the literature these results are yet another indicator for the existence of an autosomal-recessiv disorder with the same clinical make-up as Bruton's disease.	2.0112118734159394
A deletion on chromosome 14 leading to the disorder was identified.	2.4193378598296107
Conservative treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence in females gained more and more interest.	2.241751529096436
The use of mini-devices is one of the newly developed therapeutical options however, its clinical relevance and longterm-results are still under debate.	2.150527453526298
This review article gives a critical evaluation of the available urethral plugs and regulators and new developments as well according to the longterm-follow-up studies in the literature and own experience with those devices.	2.610961384090229
The continence rates that can be obtained with the different plugs or regulators are dependent upon the degree of stress incontinence, ability to insert the plug and compliance of the patient.	2.220072543447356
Reported longterm results vary between 48 % and 100 %.	2.2615141427337955
The most frequent side effects are urinary infection, haematuria and/or handling problems with the devices.	2.322779602983277
According to the published material it is impossible to give therapeutical standards for treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with urethral mini-devices.	2.0036409263324946
Although proper Patient selection might give excellent longterm-results in patient continence rates.	2.0306968225325503
Background: In contrast to the correction of simple myopia there is no widely accepted technique for the correction of myopic astigmatism.	2.466257749449382
Currently two techniques are available: the photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) and the combination of arcuate keratotomies with standard PRK (PRK-T).	2.088259634158615
Although there are randomized data for CABG vs. medical therapy and CABG vs. PTCA in primary therapy of CAD, there is few evidence on the appropriate therapy of recurrent angina after prior CABG.	1.9516650485444316
We analyzed data from 1265 consecutive patients (PTS.)	2.321638154460818
presenting for recurrent angina after previous CABG who required either re-CABG (n=67), PTCA (n=768) or medical therapy alone (medRx) (n=430) at our institution during 1986 through 1996.	1.836331201994037
Outcome after index therapy is monitored during 45  +/-  34 months.	2.1229253763587277
The 3 therapeutic groups were similar with respect to gender (84 % male), age at therapy (60 years), prevalence of diabetes (22 %), and time to first ischemic event after primary CABG (37 months).	2.2454649486582325
Actuarial survival was significantly higher in the PTCA-group at 1, 5 and 10 years after therapy of recurrent angina, despite the freedom from subsequent re-intervention was significantly lower (1-year-survival 95 % [37 %] vs. 95 % [3] medRx vs. 79 % [4 %] re-CABG, 5-year-survival 87 % [57 %] vs 78 % [17 %] medRx vs. 50 % [4 %] re-CABG and 10-year-survival 72 % [65 %] vs. 63 % [31 %] medRx vs. 50 % [15 %] re-CABG resp., p < 0.0001, [numbers in brackets represent corresponding values for incidence of re-intervention, p < 0.0001]).	2.0961748277438454
These findings were similar after adjustment for different baseline characteristics.	2.1424342645191397
Due to advances in surgical methods, such as miniplate and lag screw osteosynthesis, there is current discussion about the adequate therapy of condylar fractures.	2.3744628165073327
Regarding the insufficient outcome of conservative treatment confirmed by refined methods of functional diagnosis, there is a trend towards surgical therapy, at least in cases of condylar displacement out of the fossa.	2.47667149417397
This trend was also prompted when surgeons learned that the condyle determines local growth but does not serve as a growth center of the mandible.	2.025619111792769
Along with increased interest in temporomandibular function and surgical therapy of internal disorders, surgical therapy of traumatic soft tissue lesions was emphasized.	2.1199932586085506
This consequently led to surgical restoration of intraarticular fractures.	2.249437454689841
Conservative treatment will nonetheless be sufficient in cases of minor displacement due to a higher ability of remodeling, even more so in children.	2.359834359722956
A case of a 37-year-old woman with symmetrical bilateral apocrine hidrocystomas at the lateral margins of the eyelids is presented.	2.305597580043627
The symmetrical, simultaneous and bilateral appearance of the lesions, the lack of association with other abnormalities and the absence of the lesion in the family history make this case remarkable.	2.5663405264902788
The situation of intensive care units (ICU) in Germany was analyzed by a national survey.	2.649751038288223
Questionnaires consisting of multiple-choice and short-answer questions were sent to ICUs of university hosptitals, hospitals with >1000 beds, 500-1000 beds, and hospitals with <500 beds separately with regard to the different disciplines (anesthesia ICUs, surgical ICUs, cardiac surgical ICUs, neurosurgical ICUs, neurological ICUs, mixed-surgical ICUs, internal ICUs, interdiscipline ICUs).	1.8011646508459265
The personality organisation and the process of therapy of drug-addicted patients are examined by the comparative analysis of 15 single cases.	2.21454965158757
The antisocial tendency is emphasised as the main clinical feature.	2.283791989526805
It is related to specific genetic traumata and the externalisation of parts of the superego.	2.221764712471359
If it is possible to continue therapy beyond this point, the patients can now enter into a process, in which new identifications and the integration of parts of the superego are involved.	2.2137449920987007
Approaching the end of the therapy, patients, again, tend to destroy the results of therapy if one does not consider specific problems of the separation process.	2.3794335845441887
Objective: The Uppsala-definition of leukoplakia has recently redefined oral leukoplakia.	2.0055429725643146
Based on this definition, the aim of our study was to reevaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with histologically proven primary oral cancer.	2.696063441017586
Design: A total of 101 inpatients in four tumor centers in Berlin were interviewed and clinically examined just prior to surgery of an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).	2.1468841464565553
Results: The prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15.8%.	2.391815089234802
Additional leukoplakias without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4% of the patients.	2.9975496801772623
There were no significant differences in age- or sex-distribution, history of tobacco habits or diet  between patients with or without leukoplakia.	2.0977958776901082
T1 carcinomas were found in 62.5% of patients with, and 24.4% of patients without associated leukoplakia, whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre-operative staging of the tumor.	2.4861645645870003
Conclusions: The prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with OSCC was low, compared to retrospective studies.	2.633319496990924
The presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor, except of tumor size.	2.359868423379319
The results emphasize that most OSCC develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa.	1.979665369825025
Cutaneous angiosarcomas mainly arise on the scalp and face of older patients.	2.170893488718777
They present with reddish nodules or plaques and tend to bleed and ulcerate.	1.9441056430982342
Angiosarcomas show an aggressive and recurrent course and have a high potential for metastasis.	2.424388968572183
We report on a 48-year-old patient with unilateral eyelid edema as the first manifestation of an angiosarcoma.	2.3247192556870195
The clinical presentation, the history of contact allergy, the presence of antinuclear antibodies, and abnormal thyroid function tests favoured a non-neoplastic disease.	2.281230500971609
However, multiple biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of a highly differentiated angiosarcoma.	2.8518947072972387
Staging of the patient revealed no metastasis.	3.10661351337552
After radical surgery including orbital exenteration and postoperative radiation therapy, no recurrence was observed with a follow up of 26 months.	2.090251024161285
This case underlines the importance of including angiosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of unilateral eyelid edema.	2.400829520432423
The Marburg Cardiomyopathy Study (MACAS) is a prospective observational study designed to determine the value of the following potential non-invasive arrhythmia risk predictors in more than 200 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) over a 5-year-follow-up period: New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation on ECG, QTc and JTc-dispersion on 12-lead ECG, abnormal time-domain analysis and spectral turbulence analysis of the signal-averaged ECG, ventricular arrhythmias and heart-rate variability on 24-hour Holter ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T wave alternans during exercise.	1.9807677130299102
Abstract   The observation of extremely variable clinical courses for patients with renal cell carcinomas of an identical pathological stage as well as a comparable histological differentiation resp.	2.4541543003495994
growth pattern strongly indicates the existence of tumors harboring different biological aggressiveness.	2.2220763129608203
Currently available histopathological classification systems do not predict the biological behaviour of renal cell cancer as sufficiently as the establishment of a therapeutical strategy adjusted to the individual patient would require.	2.2043033003698276
The need for a more refined characterization of the biological potential of the indidual tumor results from the introduction of modified operative strategies as organ-preserving surgery, for example, as well as from the recently suggested application of an adjuvant systemic therapy adapted to the individual risk for tumor recurrence resp.	2.1925069053001174
the development of progressive disease.	3.6438354640460875
Therefore, the clinically orientated basic scientist and the basic scientifically orientated clinician intensively try to determine prognostically important biological variables which would allow to better predict the biological aggressiveness of a single tumor in addition to "classical" prognostic parameters (T-stage, histological grading, growth patterns).	1.8242855350773408
In this context, several biological parameters including the identification of alterations on the DNA-, RNA- and protein level have been discussed as possible biological prognostic markers for renal cell cancer.	1.934955514026821
The present review tries to reflect currently available biological characteristics of RCC which might gain clinical importance with regard to an individualized therapy in the near future.	2.065615396166716
In contrast, the dermatologic literature estimates an incidence from 0.01 to 0.26%.	1.9395663561749363
In order to achieve effective treatment for these patients, knowledge of the characteristic symptoms is fundamental.	2.6617411202193875
The present paper describes the variety of disease possible, using three cases treated between 1992 and 1994 in the ENT Department of Cologne.	2.0859436755093688
According to the literature, females are involved in a ratio of 9:1, with the majority working in medically related professions.	2.2679296038561105
Depression and anorexia are typical symptoms.	2.437727457453609
When a factitious disease is suspected, psychiatric consultation is essential.	2.296054601097527
Confrontation of a suspect patient by the otolaryngologist is not often considered because several reports quote suicidal behavior in up to 25% of self-manipulating patients and tendencies to refuse to follow psychiatric treatment are considerable.	1.8990294642149645
Numerous different diseases lead to scarring alopecia with irreversible follicular destruction as a common ending.	2.0804797542544726
Current classifications are based on clinical, histopathological or prognostic parameters, as well as on pathogenetic criteria which allow only a rough assessment because the precise mechanisms leading to scarring alopecia are still unknown.	2.1469541512388806
Inadequacies of the established classifications are obvious when regarding special forms of scarring alopecia like lichen planopilaris or pseudopelade Brocq.	1.9109615105688051
In order to develop more satisfying classifications, recent insights into biology and pathology of the hair follicle and follicular cycling have to be considered.	2.00599274794045
The most important structures for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells which reside in the follicular bulge and the fibroblasts of the dermal papilla including the molecular communication between these two cell populations.	1.85427267539082
Research in the field of scarring alopecia should aim at defining the pathological processes on any of the above mentioned levels which will lead to an irreversible damage of the hair follicle thus allowing the development of new therapeutic agents.	2.4150316710671724
Rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis is a rare dermatologic disorder seen in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.	2.897137215396254
Clinically firm erythematous 3-5 mm papules are found mainly on the arms, the hips and the proximal thighs.	2.1778672773051295
The lesions may be pruritic leading to excoriations and crusts.	2.2087236077728143
Histology reveals a dense dermal infiltrate with neutrophilic granulocytes, while leukocytoclasia may be seen, vasculitits is not observed.	1.9131074612032004
This overview of rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis may help remind the practioner to include this uncommon disorder in the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis-related dermatoses.	2.068064738036515
Background: The rehabilitation of low vision patients is of increasing importance since the number of these patients has grown rapidly.	2.644890912113636
We wanted to evaluate the actual spectrum of patients concerning age and diagnoses and the appropriate low vision aids (LVA) in 1 year.	2.0621315644778044
It is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated electively.	2.062726558153704
Three strategies are presented: prophylactic indication on principle (A), elective operation in every second case (B), and operation in case of strangulation only (C).	2.2425623570258226
On the basis of available epidemiological data it is calculated that, for the male German population aged 65 years and over 69 954 (A), 36 292 (B), and 2630 (C) inguinal hernia repairs would be necessary annually; 167 (A), 145 (B) and 123 (C) perioperative deaths would occur, connected with 1702 (A), 1373 (B) and 1048 (C) years of life lost, respectively.	1.8463977711684543
Thus, operation of every inguinal hernia would result in a (small) reduction of life expectancy.	2.208731174199961
These data provide evidence that in elderly patients the indication for operative treatment of inguinal hernias should depend upon symptoms and suffering.	2.4065097354961513
There is no reason to operate on asymptomatic patients because of a presumed risk of strangulation.	2.2946705872055
Since first described by Kibler (1955) hyperalgetic areas of the skin in company with arthropathy or diseases of internal organs are known to be a useful sign to define the affected segment.	2.301263601634684
While seldom utilized by physicians, physiotherapists frequently make use of these special findings concerning the skin as a common part of their daily work.	2.0673994990201288
A certain problem exists in ranging correctly the corresponding segment of the spine, this mostly caused by the inaccurate idea of anatomical facts.	2.172436279196974
The actual as well as the former literature in this field shows very different views and opinions, all of them rather in contrast to the real anatomical findings.	2.4294977987940447
Aim of the study and methods: In the present study the correlation between ischemia induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials was investigated.	2.369576694609023
In 16 patients with significant coronary artery disease and survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia an electrophysiologic study (EPS) was performed.	2.333529720666815
Before EPS (t1), at every stimulation interval and after induction of a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) the lactate concentration was measured in arterial blood and in the coronary sinus for calculation of the myocardial lactate extraction.	2.100444286044047
Furthermore, before investigation, after induction of a VT/VF and after a 10 minute recovery phase an analysis of the signal averaged ECG was performed.	2.1560861994334464
Nine patients showed a so-called "lactate reversal", i.e., an increase of the lactate concentration in the coronary sinus over the concentration of the arterial blood as an expression of ischemia development, during inducibility of a VT/VF (group A).	2.3724062959306202
The control group consisted of 7 patients without ischemia related VT/VF (group B).	2.1098543463278467
Results: In group A significant changes of the three late potential criteria were found between t1 and t2 (QRS:115.61 +/- 13.86 vs. 126.06 +/- 16.74, p=0.08; RMS: 25.81 +/- 22.26 vs. 13.11 +/- 10.72, p=0.01; LAS: 37.72 +/- 19.26 vs. 50.06 +/- 10.72, p=0.01).	1.7228600118751944
In group B, no significant changes could be measured.	2.609655409409076
Furthermore, the prevalence of late potentials increased in group A from 66% (t1) to 89% (t2), whereas in group B no increase was detectable.	2.1975406860202646
Conclusions: These data suggest a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials in correlation with the inducibility of ventricular tycharrhythmias due to ischemic circumstances.	2.09814129378864
Therefore the dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials can be an expression of a modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate in arrhythmia endangered patients.	2.090503835883137
Recent studies and reviews continue to report a high mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which involves a severe inflammatory reaction within the whole lung that is frequently associated with multiple-organ failure.	2.126333472912585
Important factors contributing to the poor results in severe ARDS are the aggressive procedures required to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation, such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory pressures and high inspired oxygen concentrations (FiO2) which themselves contribute to the progression of the disease.	2.087567440984305
As no specific therapy that reduces or prevents the general inflammatory reaction is known, current therapy is limited to procedures that minimize peak inspiratory pressures and FiO2.	1.941859122429172
Therefore, pressure- and volume-limited ventilation modes with positive end-expiratory pressure, controlled hypercapnia, differential lung ventilation when appropriate, positioning (particularly prone), and aggressive dehydration are used.	1.957496369294022
Should these procedures fail to improve arterial gas exchange, the patients may be additionally treated by veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange.	2.103059852982678
From April 1989 to August 1993, 89 patients were transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of severe ARDS; 52 were treated by combining the described conventional methods without artificial gas exchange (survival rate 88%) and 37 additionally underwent artificial gas exchange (survival rate 57%).	1.9346858325385243
On the basis of these experiences, we conclude that this step-by-step approach may improve survival in patients with severe ARDS.	2.321470333384623
Cutis marmorata teleangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is a rare congenital vascular disorder of the venous system.	2.6019670617327724
In 50% of cases there are associated anomalies of other organ systems.	2.2638523055284026
Clinical improvement of the cutaneous manifestations is noted in most cases and usually occurs during the first year of life.	2.636013681618726
We present a patient with CMTC with a band-like pattern following the L3 dermatome.	2.1364623811879544
At the age of 13 years, the skin manifestations worsened, with ulcerations and intermittent claudication.	2.435945119002102
Angiographic imaging revealed stenosis of the deep femoral artery, and the circumflex femoral artery and the first perforating arteries were not visualized.	2.6725031135130886
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of CMTC with anomalies of the large arteries.	2.0951191275788696
Introduction: The efficacy of vascular surgery in the treatment of popliteal arterial aneurysms (PAA) and the justification of conservative therapy was investigated in the present study.	2.9535907032023663
Materials and methods: From January 1985 to December 1996, 87 patients were operated on for PAA.	2.2285383741337412
The clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients were categorized concerning PAA-related symptoms, vascular run-off, and material used for vascular reconstruction.	1.9078415505928266
Patients were examined, and the patency of the vascular reconstruction was checked by palpation and Doppler sonography.	2.5065428958774447
Results: The cumulative survival calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curve was 70% after 10 years.	2.004017639601296
Asymptomatic patients had the best results and patients with acute ischemia, the worst.	2.937019332493141
The outcome concerning patent vs. occluded run-off and autologous vs. heterologous bypass material was similar.	1.8619828009251584
Conclusion: Asymptomatic and uncomplicated PAA should be treated surgically.	2.3607661408541203
Only PAA with a diameter less than 2 cm, and without thrombus on the vessel walls can be treated conservatively.	2.384593873647598
Collodion baby is a clinical description for a transient condition of the newborn which is caused by various disorders of cornification.	2.385112703184663
The majority of cases are due to autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis.	2.4056424169134925
In up to 10% of cases "self-healing" of the skin occurs.	2.883485342901444
We report about a mature male baby who at birth was covered entirely with a shining, collodion-like membrane.	1.7642763574363292
There also were marked ectropion of the eyelids and eversion of the lips.	2.1157843538606533
After shedding of the membrane almost complete clearing of the skin occurred until the age of three months.	2.5036356941145734
In the case reported here skin biopsies taken on the 20th day of life showed discrete and non-specific ultrastructural changes, with no features of lamellar ichthyosis or other cornification disorders.	1.914624962115028
Past research on the phenomenon of enhanced pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia syndome (FS) revealed evidence for both a higher pain magnitude in response to nociceptive stimuli (hyperalgesia) and a general perceptual amplification of sensations (hypervigilance).	1.9113395874075292
Results were compared with those from age-matched painfree controls.	2.493964249966425
Amplitudes of middle-latency (N1) and long-latency (P2) laser evoked potentials (LEPs) were significantly higher in FS than in controls.	2.123643778632657
Furthermore, laser intensity at pain but not at sensation threshold was lower in FS than in controls.	1.8919630023681626
However, auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) did not differ between groups.	2.3720721006807515
Enhanced N1 and P2 amplitudes of LEPs suggest stronger sensory and attentional processing of nociceptive information in FS, respectively.	1.8171519805303058
The concept of hypervigilance is challenged by the failure to find differences in auditory perception among FS and control patients.	1.8848121727074965
Yet, the importance of unpleasant intensities of auditory stimulation, not applied in this study, to reveal abnormal non-nociceptive perceptual amplification in FS is discussed.	2.2360031193376826
In a prospective study, 53 fractures of the distal fifth of the tibia were stabilized by unreamed nailing.	2.358171713667741
Additional involvement of the ankle joint occurred in 18 patients.	2.745276949349555
50 patients returned for follow-up.	2.601932682868555
In 30 patients tibia and fibula were fractured at the same (distal) level; in 20 patients the fracture of the fibula was located more proximally.	2.2344053871146894
In 12 patients the fractures extended into the tibial pilon.	2.185253841637454
Severe soft tissue damage was seen in 24 fractures (18 open, 6 closed).	2.334911567195651
Ninety percent of all fractures healed uneventfully without further surgical intervention after unreamed nailing.	2.150488518132263
In two patients the unreamed nail had to be exchanged for a reamed tibial nail.	2.199057633787652
Bone grafting and secondary dynamization of the nail by removal of a proximal interlocking bolt were performed in one case each.	2.445888890717797
Thirty-one fractures healed in anatomical position.	2.206760556170957
Valgus or varus angulation of less than 5  ° occurred in 18 patients.	2.3430273336581275
One fracture healed with rotatory angulation of 15  °.	2.3261435934974943
The highest rate of complications (22 %) was seen in patients with distal fractures of the fibula without additional plating (of the fibula).	2.8329179998875937
There was no deep infection.	2.452692409050647
Tibial fractures close to the ankle joint can be managed by unreamed nailing.	2.70886617638561
Distal fractures of the fibula should be stabilized by additional plating.	2.764994758450953
Because of the unreamed technique of implantation this procedure can also be used in grade II or III open fractures.	2.2206467304833484
Complex mechanisms have evolved in mammalian cells for regulating cellular lifespan.	2.0894722616725185
Normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions.	1.9627513171365054
In contrast, tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed immortalized.	1.9603962635228942
It has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the eukaryotic chromosomes - the telomeres - is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle.	2.309932263797008
The enzyme telomerase adds TTAGGG repeats onto mammalian telomeres, preventing their shortening.	1.9261070508287903
Telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells, but detectable in tumor cells.	2.089950849552528
The activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in tumorigenesis in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become immortal.	2.300110872725049
This review describes the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase and their role in cellular senescence and human aging.	1.98714718857202
It summarizes aspects of telomerase in cancer and its function as a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker.	2.30932030882189
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases has developed into an important method in surgical pathology.	2.0748591567315273
We summarize our experience in this area based on 3500 analyses performed during the past 5 years.	2.3314996870694373
The peculiarity of material from a pathological laboratory is the risk of DNA fragmentation as a consequence of tissue fixation.	2.3442231660461177
For this reason the assays used must be adapted to this particular situation.	2.114225747882044
PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases, if performed according to appropriate quality standards, is a safe and effective technique with high sensitivity and specificity and results in an etiologically based diagnosis.	2.10349593031953
The shift of age distribution within the population of industrialized societies has led to an increased need of treating diseases in elderly patients and at the same time in a higher number of patients bearing an increased operative risk.	2.2944279203602895
Today, the development of surgical techniques and intensive care treatment enables us to carry out numerous procedures in geriatric patients.	2.5611912073840735
Innovative surgical techniques like minimal invasive surgery with minor trauma due to the surgical approach changed patient's categories, also.	2.4185185999078382
Taken together with other procedures causing less operative stress indications for patients who were not operable previously have changed.	2.1933151916579523
New developments such as organ transplantation and immunosuppression also generated totally new groups of patients with very distinct conditions for the operative procedure.	2.3142071831851307
Vanishing indications or selection of patients as in peptic ulcer disease changed the surgical approach completely: Negative selection has shifted elective operative interventions in ulcer disease to emergency procedures.	1.9334716471514573
Contrasting experiences made in most other countries and especially in the third world, in Germany economic restrictions have not been encountered as of yet.	2.3100849099937184
Economical conditions, an increase in surgical procedures in elderly patients and advances in medical science will continue to change the surgical patient's characteristics profoundly.	2.301676630796972
From the physicians viewpoint we have to actively participate in this development by personal interaction with the patient, by interdisciplinary cooperation and prompt social and political action.	2.1032547905281715
Osteoid osteomas are tumors with intense clinical symptoms and extensive reactive bone changes far exceeding the volume of the lesion itself.	2.1726017054645057
Because of their small size they can be approached by minimally invasive surgical procedures.	2.14478258787873
We treated ten symptomatic patients with osteoid osteomas (n 6 hip point, n 1 iliac bone, n 1 femoral diaphysis, n2 tibial diaphysis) by excision of the nidus with a 3-mm Harlow-Wood needle using a percutaneous CT-guided approach.	1.8884772592160388
Seven patients with residual tumor were treated with either thermocautery (n 2) or sclerosis with 1 ml of 96% ethanol (n 5).	2.1280707695301904
Six patients had instant and constant relief (3 years' observation) of their pain.	2.0304460072405877
In two patients a second transcutaneous intervention was successful.	2.3185604106347304
Only two patients needed open resection.	2.528928558365307
Compared with the invasive open resection of the tumors, sometimes even putting the stability of the femoral neck at risk, transcutaneous CT-guided enucleation of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma with additional sclerotherapy is a good alternative method, especially in the region of the femoral neck.	2.286705539594633
We live in an epoch that could be designated as the post-Gutenberg-era.	2.141152277889199
Writing is no longer the dominant sign system.	2.6142372749688896
It is replaced by electronic signs.	2.3859293993187123
We consider approximately the year 1950 as the turning-point between these two epochs, because by then, in the years after the 2nd World War the American households were saturated with televisions.	2.002536498029816
Thereby, the new sign system asserted itself.	2.3407420638661462
The topic of this article is the transformation of our sign system and thereby of our worlds of symbols, the leap from the world of written signs into the world of electronic signs, and the possibility born out of it to create electronic objects, which I prefer to call virtual objects.	1.910526451054918
These electronic signs developed quickly a life of their own.	2.3026079423889
A totally new class of objects came into being, the class of virtual objects.	1.971958956253313
These are electronically transformed, completed or wholly electronically produced objects.	1.957646052116358
This procedure is accompanied by an industrialization of object-choice and object-relationships.	2.1156886139999633
The manipulated object-choice and object-relationship is born and, moreover, a displacement of natural objects through virtual ones.	1.8131442994819096
A change of the socio-cultural understanding is also a consequence of this process.	2.3275248602901026
New patterns of socio-cultural understanding develop, that could be described as industrial feudalism.	2.149509305677403
The goal of this article is to describe the transformation of our world of signs and the connected industrialization of object relationships, and to interprete them according to our present possibilities.	2.0928210831948504
All studies examined small doses of morphine injected intraarticularly at the end of knee surgery, but not all studies did show an analgesic effect of the peripheral opioid.	2.320649396404701
Because of differing study designs a meta-analysis of the data is not possible.	2.523319477783041
Dysplastic epithelia represent potentially precancerous conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case.	2.4596945077795036
Using DNA image cytometry on restained, conventional Pap-smears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells.	1.8090255630301884
The identification of DNA aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90%.	2.0116003409972434
DNA aneuploidy qualifies squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade (H-SIL) which have to be treated whereas lack of DNA aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL) which have only to be controlled.	1.9529451818522385
The methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation.	2.061632477719775
In this brief article I attempt to sketch a few salient insights from my career as a researcher and practitioner of psychotherapy: The key to successful therapy is undoubtedly the therapist's empathic listening, coupled with a series of other positive attributes and finely honed interpersonal skills.	1.6369042703604024
On the debit side, patients' hostility frequently evokes counterhostility from the therapist which not infrequently results in a negative outcome.	1.993779103439641
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a procedure for inserting a tracheal cannula without a large incision, without extensive dissection of pretracheal tissue, and without exposure of the trachea.	1.9648050233101795
The early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare.	2.433962058404585
Although it is a simple procedure, it is not a minor operation.	3.3228969077768538
Users must be familiar with the technique, the indications and contra-indications for the procedure, as well as the complications.	2.7185540094290634
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a relatively new technique for inserting a cannula in the tracheal lumen.	2.1324669855926714
It can be done at the patients bedside with only minimal complications.	2.2659267374008922
A short history, the indications and contraindications, the early and late complications of the technique, and comparisons with other techniques as well as with conventional open tracheotomy are reviewed.	2.4202067290111042
In this study, a histologic and histomorphometric analysis of delayed and immediate-placed implants was performed.	1.953982586861352
An implantation of 16 self-cutting conical titanium screw implants was carried out in 8 beagle dogs.	2.1719123503473936
Of these implants, 8 were placed immediately after extraction of the second premolar and 8 implants were placed after 6 months of healing after extraction.	2.079461285721181
For dynamic histomorphometry, fluorochrome bone markers were injected at two different times prior to euthanasia.	1.904249192459556
The specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically 8 months after implantation.	2.2527981114647115
A histologic, dynamic, and static histomorphometry was performed with the aid of different computer programs.	2.3794725489555377
A mean surface of osseointegration of 75.7% and a mean soft tissue implant contact surface of 24.2% was seen in immediate-placed implants.	1.9904635778106161
For delayed implantation, an osseointegrated surface of 80.7% and a soft tissue covering of 19.3% was examined.	1.9429366166471107
The fibrogenic structures in the cervical implant part were more dense and there were more adhesive epithelial elements (hemidesmosomes) around delayed implants.	1.873765981357772
The result of the dynamic and static histomorphometry showed no significant differences in the two groups (P < 0.1).	2.754928122446971
In conclusion, it can be stated that a new steady-state of the soft and hard tissue around dental implants was seen 8 months after implant insertion in both groups.	2.1294218544411523
There was a pseudoankylotic healing in the osseous part.	2.1578667066023836
The lower level of osseointegration in immediate-placed implants was caused by early resorption of bone in the crestal part.	1.9436537837729586
Thus, a larger part of the implant was surrounded by soft tissue and a long epithelial attachment resulted.	2.4138867747668784
Polydactyly may be preaxial or tibial (halluxside), postaxial or ulnar (side of the little toe) and central (middle toes).	1.8418188732238772
The duplication may appear at the distal and medial phalanges or at the whole digit.	2.156741019922054
The metatarsal bone may be partwise or completely duplicated, the accessory toes may share only one metatarsal.	1.8367646342996122
Surgical intervention may be indicated in shoeproblems, for esthetic reasons or, especially in duplication of the metatarsales, because of secondary deviation of the toes and therefore shoeproblems or plantar callosities.	2.035519668750707
Preoperative analysis including x-ray is of great importance to achieve good functional and cosmetic results.	2.416102882142501
Across centers, transfusion can vary eightfold for the same mediastinal drainage after adult cardiac operations.	1.9854121084046852
Excessive blood drainage resulting in increased transfusions occurs in 29 % of patients.	2.198364624294532
Various strategies have been proposed to decrease bleeding and allogenic transfusion requirements in the perioperative period of heart surgery.	2.210088965240941
Blood conservation methods were reviewed critically.	2.5008073723049313
Avoidance of preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations, the use of autologous blood, and adherence to a strict transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogenic transfusions.	2.4171783562032982
Perioperatively, maintenance of normothermia contributes to improved hemostasis.	2.2575494290646985
Injections with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) are considered the first-line treatment for spasmodic torticollis (ST), blepharospasm (BL) and hemifacial spasm (HFS).	1.7791800979356232
Because BTX brings only temporary and partial relief, patients frequently try other additional therapies to minimize their symptoms.	1.8493776616620161
The subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with ST, BL and HFS was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire.	2.0383945499534053
Two hundred questionnaires were considered (112 TS, 54 BL, 34 HFS).	1.946376820593121
BTX was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups (median: 2=good effect).	2.1854423435007373
Despite Citalopram and physiotherapy (median: 3=average effect), all other therapies were rated with a median of >=4 (=minimal effect).	2.119158517434962
Patients with ST tried 7.7, patients with BL 2.4 and patients with HFS 2.6 different types of therapy.	2.300875336116657
In conclusion, BTX is the most effective treatment for patients with ST, BL and HFS, as rated subjectively.	2.219485813938023
Further evaluation of therapies additional to BTX injections is recommended.	2.152296225176128
The perioperative morbidity and mortality is mainly influenced by the type and duration of surgery as well as the patient's preoperative state of health.	2.8257675945421057
Anesthesia per se, however, may also result in severe perioperative (patho)physiological changes, which may be both desired (e.g.	2.205432492228104
analgesia, vasodilation in vascular surgery) or detrimental (e.g.	2.1307582224407793
hypothermia, ventilatory depression) and which may differ depending on the anesthetic technique used (e.g.	2.127265667821682
general anesthesia vs. regional anesthesia).	2.436615501862255
Yet, all anesthestic techniques have in common, that their effects are not limited to the duration of the surgical intervention, but may expand far into the postoperative period.	2.476723568337288
Therefore, many trials have been performed in the past aiming to compare the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the incidence of postoperative techniques, no significant advantage of one or the other technique has been identified up to now with respect to postoperative mortality or severe morbidity.	2.5438414182534537
This finding may be due to at least three factors.	2.7358113893643843
1) Many side-effects related to anesthesia - due to close postoperative monitoring - are detected and treated early in the postoperative phase (e.g.	2.038271196590015
in the recovery room), thereby preventing serious complications.	2.3513190921840117
2) Postoperative mortality related exclusively to anesthesia probably is so low, that huge patient numbers would be required to demonstrate any significant differences between different techniques.	2.02615633273052
3) Besides the factor 'anesthesia', may other factors contribute to the anesthesia related morbidity and mortality (e.g.	2.169092105214079
the factor 'anesthetist') which are hardly quantified.	2.251672944959181
The fact that clear advantages for a single technique have not yet been demonstrated must not, however, result in anesthetic 'nihilism'.	2.1942152899157756
Rather there may be good reasons in the individual patient (e.g.	2.40573459108611
lack of a recovery room), to prefer a certain anesthetic technique or drug over another, in order to lower the individual risk of anesthesia.	2.2842716458062395
Whether the use of a certain technique - e.g.	2.699948621274301
spinal or epidural anesthesia - may contribute to a reduction of specific postoperative surgical complications (e.g.	2.292277002766339
rate of reocclusion subsequent to peripheral vascular surgery) is presently under investigation.	2.1922889334005777
This paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose.	2.2777748467461465
We then introduce its objectives, the members of the study group, the composition of the collective and selection of cases, and the methods used for ascertainment and recording of data.	2.6022217952564026
Results are then presented with reference to the various hypotheses put forward.	2.4561854860093395
After some introductory remarks about the traumatizing experience many parents have after the birth of a very small preterm baby (<= 1500 g), a developmental risk model is presented.	1.942112802491271
This is the basis for an early beginning preventive psychotherapeutic intervention.	2.4086698521422263
In the Ulm Study the comprehensive parent-centered intervention program includes insight oriented focal individual psychotherapy, supportive group psychotherapy, a home visit and a video-based sensitivity training.	1.7765762784072388
The intervention aims to improve parental coping, the process of attachment and parent-infant interaction.	2.06905864488953
The theoretical implications, the design and the methods of this prospective randomized longitudinal study will be discussed.	2.3044674731970978
We report the case of a 55-year-old male patient who underwent transanal endoscopic microsurgery for recurrent benign rectal adenoma.	2.104548849349018
Rudolf Nissen was born in Neisse, Schlesien, 9 September 1896.	2.013681897345314
From 1921 to 1933 he was the favorite pupil of Ferdinand Sauerbruch in Munich and Berlin.	1.9417207934213594
1930 he became professor of surgery at the Charité.	2.2378744838687687
The assumption of power by the Nazi-regime forced Nissen to resign his position and end his career in Germany.	1.8117882996369
He took over the surgical chair in Istanbul, Turkey.	2.115640814325229
Emigrating in 1939 to the USA, he held surgical positions in hospitals at New York and accepted in 1952 the chair of Surgery at the University of Basel, Switzerland.	1.9185274608936318
Nissen died in Riehen/Basel on 22 January 1981.	2.08850371214217
Nissen was a critical observant clinician, an efficient and popular physician, a teacher and a speaker.	1.9729656485827318
Of historical significance are pioneering works in thoracic surgery, the first successful pneumectomy in man, the classical works about the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and hiatus hernia.	2.1529849146010163
The Nissen-Rossetti type of fundoplication has remained the standard procedure in Europe and the USA.	2.194293482786491
This study describes the approach that is necessary in outpatient surgery in order to carry out the operation safely.	2.517382466180463
The particular procedure is discussed, and the necessity of strict postoperative management is shown.	2.8847980313743697
Between 1994 and 1997, the author supervised 4588 outpatient operations, of which 3020 were arthroscopic.	2.122152664316372
The observed complications are listed and evaluated.	2.351865259024661
Overall, outpatient surgery is well accepted by the patients.	2.6887554094091386
The criteria for denying a patient surgery on an outpatient basis are laid out.	2.058288331362212
The Schering Atlas is a teaching file in CT and MRI anatomy designed for physicians and students.	2.148541628809609
It is available on CD-ROM, shows good image quality, and is easy to use in medium-price-range personal computer systems.	2.0350403517981768
Because of the amount and quality of image material, the Schering Atlas's price is appropriate for institutions, but not for private users.	2.1116948082259905
M. Linehan developed "dialectical behavioral therapy" specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients.	1.949103252117196
It rests on a biosocial model that assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress.	2.0345945738757076
The numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self-destructive behavior, inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem-solving.	1.7168388467043232
This concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them.	1.9147820385173404
A comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies.	1.9846991639961609
Parallel to development of the therapy itself, a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual's guidelines, thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation.	2.1388352166683653
An initial controlled, randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels.	2.1043816980168613
In the current endeavor to develop disorder-specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders, "dialectical behavioral therapy" is a noteworthy model.	2.370390167326723
Complications associated with the application of a halo device are not infrequent; however, osteomyelitis of the skull with a consecutive subdural abscess is a rare but severe complication.	2.4470039449677543
We present the case of a patient with a subdural abscess as a result of a local pin-track infection of the halo device, in whom pathological behavior was the primary clinical finding.	2.3094725243301424
The possible complications associated with the halo device are discussed with emphasis on associated head injuries and preexisting neurological diseases, as well as indications for the halo, clinical symptoms of pin-track infections, necessary diagnostic measurements and the appropriate treatment.	2.3338832464607946
The attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system - analogical to electronic data processing systems - as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system.	2.0009686578142585
Thereby dysfunctions can be seen as misplaced variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences.	2.0845660240372603
This leads to a failure of the corresponding software modul that results in the loss of function which is regulated through this modul.	2.4168122338360662
Especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through needling, a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function.	1.9977085095754181
With this hypothesis all phenomens of dysfunctions can be explained.	2.2661589467016716
Empirical data on costs of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany are rare.	2.2253607275110263
There is a lack of cross-sectional studies as well as of any analysis of the long-term course of mental health care costs.	2.7596110952644763
This study combines data from two cost-studies on patients with schizophrenia, conducted in the same catchment area at an interval of 15 years, to draw conclusions about the long-term course of these costs.	2.204438698061935
The direct costs of comprehensive community based mental health care had increased by 77.0% during 15 years, while the costs of a permanents stay in a long-term ward of a psychiatric hospital had increased by 78.5% in the same period.	2.148741040313304
This increase was 27 and 28.5 per cent higher than the general rise in cost of living in Germany during the interval between the two studies.	2.239461911701387
This higher-than-average increase in mental health care costs was accompanied by a much higher cost-effectiveness.	2.182633822915471
Thus, this rise of costs must be seen as a consequence of the great deficits and the resulting basic improvement of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany, which was demanded by an expert-commission of the government in the mid-seventies.	2.231587701171061
Background: The usefulness of Holter monitoring to detect rarely occuring symptoms seems to be limited.	2.2638297129862317
In adults the event recorder has already been a precise diagnostic tool in evaluating palpitations and syncopes.	2.0573747601448438
There have been few reports of the implementation of cardiac monitoring with an event recorder in children.	2.158120583661115
The immunomodulating effect of primary surgical intervention was investigated in 33 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx.	2.2422293163769047
An operation time longer than 7 h was significantly associated with a decrease in lymphocytes, CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD8+ T-lymphocytes.	2.2558287343088184
The CD4/CD8-ratio as a marker for the down-regulation of the cellular immune response was slightly decreased but was still in the normal range.	2.1407405721779655
CD4-lymphocyte counts increased 7 days after operation while CD8 lymphocytes were found elevated 4 weeks after sugery.	2.056546987958852
The in vitro stimulation of the lymphocytes was impaired for 1 to 4 weeks.	2.297134493508161
Interleukins, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor did not show any changes after surgery.	2.2515494524599116
Decreases of lymphocytes, especially CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, were significantly associated with the time of operation and the volume of blood loss.	2.502795784178202
Extensive trauma, age, different kinds of anesthesia and intensive care interventions were not associated with specific immunomodulating effects, although these factors might be responsible for suppressing cytokine responses.	2.1425005008572864
Both preclinical and clinical evidence support the usefulness of antidepressants in chronic pain treatment.	2.3773445994953364
Monoamine uptake inhibitors influence the neurotransmissions of noradrenaline (NA) and/or serotonin (5-HT); their effect on nociception is thought to take place predominantly within the spinal cord.	2.2426084343595205
Antidepressant drugs seem to differ in their properties as analgesics and as thymoleptics.	2.173300179912342
The present work is aimed at correlating the special mechanism of action of antidepressants in diminishing nocicepetion with the pharmacological profile of these drugs in clinical pain treatment.	2.0350128902831637
From a preclinical, experimental point of view, it can be expected, that mixed type uptake blockers should be superior to selective NA or 5-HT uptake inhibitors.	2.1767810170446205
The analgesic profile of antidepressants was established by a metaanalysis of clinical trials on the effect of these drugs, given alone or in combination with other analgetics, in chronic pain syndromes.	2.4465156994259543
57 Clinical trials were separated into 5 groups according to their scientific quality: [1] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with high power; [2] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with low power; [3-4] open controlled studies or studies with historical controls; [5] case reports.	1.9283833298889654
A study was positive if the tested antidepressant was more effective than placebo or the compared drug or seemed beneficial with respect to the interval of its previous absence.	2.064782589822626
The most effective antidepressants in chronic pain treatment only included unselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors in the following rank order: amitriptyline > clomipramine >= desipramine >= imipramine >= doxepin.	1.8750916308750833
A statement about the appropriate dosage of these drugs in chronic pain treatment, however, must wait for properly conducted dose finding studies which include the measurement of plasma concentrations.	2.282466161825201
Intensive care medicine for both surgical and medical patients has a common scientific and clinical basis.	2.1950693042403193
In critically ill patients the medical conditions are complex and can be managed only by specialists thoroughly trained in intensive care medicine.	2.3423518419600224
Therefore, surgeons as well as anesthesiologists must have a detailed theoretical and clinical knowledge of intensive care medicine.	2.3887460271435375
Surgical training places the emphasis on operative skills, while intraoperative management of the patient by the anesthesiologist calls for skills involved in intensive care medicine.	2.085657609722591
Interdisciplinary cooperation between specialists is essential to improve the quality of intensive care medicine further.	2.9607697326059594
The cooperation that already exists between surgeons and anesthesiologists makes closer collaboration in the future a logical step.	2.092516646536955
In this review article data of retrospective studies on the therapeutic effects of oxygen are summarized and possible indications for this therapy suggested.	2.087431223559515
Studies in infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) showed that (i) if SaO2 was kept >= 93 % via generous prescription of home oxygen, rates of sudden death were much lower than in studies where this was less generously prescribed, (ii) weight gain was significantly better with O2 therapy than without it, (iii) increasing SaO2 from 82 to 93 % by providing low-flow oxygen resulted in a 50 % reduction of pulmonary artery pressure, (iv) hypoxia could cause a significant increase in airway resistance, and (v) low-flow oxygen reduced the frequency of intermittent falls in SaO2 to < 85 % even in infants who had values of >= 90 % at rest.	1.8510389744246631
These data suggest that oxygen therapy should be considered in CLD infants if baseline SaO2 is < 93 %.	2.185543322765354
For older infants, particularly with CF, only few data are available.	2.360489831001601
Regarding the practical aspects of home oxygen therapy, provision of liquid oxygen via nasal cannulae appears to be the method of choice.	2.2655598273769764
Side effects include the risk of CO2 retention, which occurs occasionally in children with CF or sleep-related upper airway obstruction, but has not been reported for infants with CLD.	2.3161590463466757
To identify this potential side effect and to determine the exact amount of oxygen required, performance of a sleep recording of SaO2 and CO2 with and without oxygen is suggested.	2.096536221953312
In infants with CLD, home monitoring of oxygenation should also be considered.	2.2470344492516587
Fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social-economic relevance.	2.375296891663098
For treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards.	2.2357108345258254
The demand for stable osteosynthesis of A3-, B2-B3 and C1-C2-fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting, even for the elder patient.	1.7763473770759832
The isolated external fixation with K-wires represent special situation.	2.224875324030943
Supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development.	2.1998734796671546
Introduction: Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy is rare and represents a high risk for mother and fetus.	2.4712354888871184
Due to the variable clinical presentation it may be mistaken for preeclampsia.	2.2267506032580147
Case: A 34-year-old primiapara with hypertension up to 240/120 mmHg.	2.2257181187329795
After diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma its resection together with lymph node metastasis in the 17th week of gestation was performed.	2.2464486420550682
Conclusion: The definitive diagnosis is confirmed by elevation of serum catecholamines and their metabolites in a 24-h urine collection.	2.0959370960914714
Localization during pregnancy can be made by ultrasound and MRI.	2.800319351717443
The definitive treatment is surgical removal after administration of adrenergic blockers.	2.350159495324216
If discovered later in pregnancy, delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumor resection is recommended.	2.0370183302188014
Since about 10 % of pheochromocytomas are malignant, postpartum screening is required to detect and treat extraadrenal or metastatic tumors by MIBG scintigraphy, chemotherapy or surgical procedures.	1.9305344629347114
Ionizing radiation from natural or man-made sources may affect human health.	2.025424142559136
The main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer.	2.2173719830937766
To quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed.	2.050921259463953
The ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation.	2.4103166471139392
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated.	2.285242502462175
In an asymptomatic 13-year-old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the Aa.	2.281941401634389
The vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic.	2.482893885821201
Angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the Aa.	2.2490220278043815
After 13 months of low-density-lipoprotein(LDL)-apheresis angiographically there was no pregression, but even slight improvement of vascular the disease.	2.077577353358871
Discussion: Since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination, we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia.	2.0042860797712296
LDL-apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients.	2.9795442804645935
Since 1993 almost 400 patients with port wine stains have been treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	2.1204837972656976
The therapeutic effect on 61 adult patients was evaluated.	2.259145494557762
After a mean of 2.16 treatments the colour lightened by between 33% and 100% in 70% of these patients.	2.1989347575960787
The best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains.	2.6369402566131486
In this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful.	2.2169482745558167
The rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5%.	2.367218359617218
The results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions.	2.4127582326575565
The flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains.	2.5920121183897935
Most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures.	2.2242169967556946
Depending on the scope of the sutures affected, the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects.	2.2983124221674647
The etiopathology is still unclear.	2.5411016179160493
Various therapies have been developed over the past 100 years.	2.610289278880234
Numerous adjustments have since perfected this operational technique.	2.1604228919293296
At the same time, these techniques have also aided the advancements in tumor surgery and traumatology.	2.0649319142564817
Injuries of the flexor tendon are usually open injuries.	2.269944601031682
In most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons.	2.088349037941908
This is different for injuries of the extensor tendon.	2.4208452894821684
Three quarters of injuries of the extensor tendon are closed injuries.	2.388405767678991
Therefore we do go into primary and secondary reconstruction of the flexor tendon, but focus on primary and secondary reconstruction of the extensor tendon in the most common zones (1, Th I, 3, Th III).	2.2097769062872326
The Shouldice operation has evolved to become the classic procedure for open pure tissue repair for inguinal hernias.	1.9988548060101305
The operation is an important part of a surgeon's repertoire as he may need to perform the procedure at some critical time, especially when faced with strangulation, when tension-free prosthetic repairs and laparoscopic approaches fail.	2.0180118272515153
When properly done, the Shouldice repair yields results that have set standards for all other techniques to emulate.	2.005544955395982
Other particular advantages of the technique are: safety, the use of local anaesthesia, benign postoperative complications and the cost, which is the most reasonable of all surgical techniques.	2.7562673732127934
Acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge.	2.276784022252612
Acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical/surgical emergency mandating prompt diagnosis (clinical awareness, angiography) and therapy (exploratory laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction; embolectomy, thrombectomy; and/or bowel resection).	1.847646968822494
The difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from 70 % to 90 % in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from 20 % to 70 % in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins.	2.398047715841125
Improved survival from nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high-risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures (intra-arterial infusion of papaverine through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection).	2.160157676919398
For assessment of bowel viability, the clinical judgement during first- or second-look exploration is still the most reliable parameter.	2.1807509985807285
The surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes aortomesenteric grafting and transaortic endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom-free patients.	2.3661395168309296
Thirty-nine of 63 patients undergoing deep anterior rectal resection received a straight coloanal anastomosis (CAA); the remaining 24 patients additionally had a colon-j-pouch (CPA) constructed.	1.7470717049573867
After pouch-anal anastomosis, local septic complications occurred in 12.5 % of patients compared to 20.5 % after coloanal anastomosis.	2.0387123133813834
Stool frequency after pouch-anal anastomosis was 3.3 per 24 h compared to 5.2 per 24 h after straight anastomosis within the first year after ileostomy closure (P = 0.053).	1.9837821827348214
Continence was slightly better in the pouch group (n. s.), and anal manometry showed a significant postoperative decrease only in resting pressure after straight coloanal anastomosis (P < 0.001).	2.274100956481877
This study supports the construction of a colon-j-pouch after deep rectal resection, as the pouch-anal anastomosis has fewer local septic complications and seems to improve functional outcome.	1.9389936137460742
The introduction of flow-directed pulmonary artery (PA) catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology.	1.9900570834669473
There have been several developments of this equipment in recent years, including continuous monitoring of mixed-venous O2 saturation (Sv\=O2) and cardiac output (CO).	1.9618892794217109
The high purchase price, however, is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill.	2.5789618735408597
The aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to standardly used intermittent monitoring of Sv\=O2 and CO.	2.032041190861182
Purpose: Persistent hypotony with maculo-pathy is a severe complication of mitomycin C when used during filtration surgery.	1.8934343978391595
We wanted to know whether this complication can be controlled by a surgical reintervention yielding tight closure of the initial sclerostomy.	2.207549068455087
The detection of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial (i) or necrotizing (n) pancreatitis (AP).	1.8376486015739766
The increase in the level of cytokines in the blood of patients with AP may correlate with the severity of the disease.	3.065966806662141
In a prospective clinical trial from October 1992 to August 1993, 23 patients with AP were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine detection by commercially available Elisa kits and C-reactive protein (CRP) by laser nephelometry.	1.796466989803953
The peak of cytokine and CRP level in the first 3 days of hospitalization was used for calculation.	2.431868443738209
The IL-6 concentration in the blood reached up to 2600 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and dropped to almost zero in the next days, independently of the clinical course.	2.210764143140133
The differentiation of i- versus nAP, using a cutoff line of 600 pg/ml, was correct in 20 patients [87 %, sensitivity (SE): 82 %, specificity (SP): 91 %, P < 0.001].	1.9585562460392825
The blood levels of IL-8 reached a maximum of 1381 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and showed a correlation with the clinical course in the following days.	2.253247941176402
The peak of IL-8 blood levels indicated correctly the severity of AP in 18 out of 23 patients using a cutoff level of 200 pg/ml (accuracy: 78 %, SE: 82 %, SP: 75 %, P < 0.01).	1.9827442301949252
The CRP levels increased up to a maximum of 535 mg/l and indicated the course of AP correctly in 18 out of 22 patients (SE and SP 82 %, P < 0.01).	2.1084884174347085
In the blood samples of five patients with i- or nAP, no TNF- was detectable.	2.123492662321891
The blood levels of IL-6, and to a lesser extent of IL-8 and CRP, can predict the severity and early systemic complications of AP.	2.5202291055328496
The excessive rise in cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells (macrophages, lymphocytes and endothelial cells) in the course of AP, inducing early systemic complications.	2.2359407379998064
Therefore, the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters (pores < 1 µm) of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study.	2.045659033218359
The analyzed hydroxyapatites were of synthetic, bovine, and phytotroph origin.	2.0292452432395587
The tricalcium phosphates and the bioglasses included only synthetic materials.	2.079419581638345
The gas adsorption of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric N2/Kr system (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics).	1.7921453821708848
Additionally, for materials with a specific surface area (> 2 m2/g) the pore size distribution was evaluated by the BJH-method.	2.196929034846803
Two of the materials evaluated astonishingly large dimensions of the specific surface area (BioOss 79.7 m2/g, Algipore new 14.6 m2/g).	1.93948825639786
A medium surface area was found for Algipore old (4.9 m2/g) and Interpore200 (2.64 m2/g).	2.0978458918365646
All other included materials showed only small sizes of the specific surface area (Ceros80 1.8 m2/g, Ceros82 1.31 m2/g, Cerasorb 1.2 m2/g, Biobase 0.7 m2/g, Endobone 0.7 m2/g, Perioglas 0.6 m2/g, Allotropat50 0.23 m2/g, Biogran 0.2 m2/g).	1.8188998117847184
The materials with large and medium sizes of the specific surface area evaluated the following pore diameters: BioOss 2-50 nm, Algipore new 2-100 nm, Algipore old 5-50 nm, Interpore200 2-100 nm.	1.8038813345941143
Pore sizes less than 2 nm were not found in relevant numbers.	2.3895468870521688
The materials BioOss, old and new Algipore, and Interpore200 contain a large interconnecting mesopore system (diameter < 1 µm).	1.8321056656417798
For the materials Biobase, Endobone, Perioglas, Allotropat 50, and Biogran this cannot be assumed.	1.8438312066896934
The materials Ceros80, Ceros82, and Cerasorb evaluated a specific surface area between those and might include only a small part of these interconnecting pores.	1.9196060794396153
An influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested.	2.2951638693543623
The literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts.	1.7885003657463738
In the present Part 4 ten possibly useful targets for future research are formulated:...	1.9603474848959004
Radiotherapy unequivocally has to be regarded as standard therapy in stage I and IIA/B testicular seminoma.	2.461187214741576
Using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95-98 % in stage I disease and 80-95 % in stage IIA/B can be achieved.	1.9953291189014242
Disease specific survival reaches 100 %.	2.5016829483006275
Likewise, radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) in a solitary testis or in case of a double-sided TIN yielding safe eradication of the in-situ carcinoma of the testis.	2.365062063984037
Objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates.	2.1908906263634944
A forty year old healthy adult man was admitted to our out-patient department because of a highly elevanted rheumatoid factor.	2.2301296466385114
Since the person was planning an extended stay in Africa, we performed an extensive history, clinical and laboratory examination to rule out oligosymptomatic inflammatory diseases.	2.1325985953785214
We further analyzed if the person presented genetic risk factors to develop rheumatic diseases in the future or if the presence of the rheumatoid factor could be a reaction to multiple immunizations.	2.2761060094959675
Possible explanations for an elevated rheumatoid factor including the genetic risk factors are discussed.	2.18428458227001
A multifactorial etiology underlies the  majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD).	2.376071728626996
Both ill-defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease.	2.693310072127897
Allele 4 of ApoE is a genetic risk factor.	2.3946905624824684
Its presence increases the risk of developing AD.	3.012127687949217
However, presence of e4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise.	2.1314861416370006
Apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease, there are rare variants which are inherited as Mendelian traits.	2.382856391783757
To date three genes are known that can be  mutated in these rare forms of AD.	2.2147252656336986
Of these, mutations in the gene presenilin 1 on chromosome 14 are most frequent.	2.08375571946942
In addition, mutations in the gene presenilin 2 on chromosome 1 and in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP on chromosome 21) occur in autosomal dominant AD.	1.9204600986427924
This article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of AD and discusses its relevance for patients with AD and their relatives.	2.363467140873122
In recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother-daughter-relationship with the conceptions of the 'lesbian complex' (Poluda-Korte), the 'symbiotic illusion' (Halberstadt-Freud), the 'higher permeability of the ego-boundaries' (Rohde-Dachser), and the 'conflict of separation-individuation which has to be resolved again and again throughout life' (Berger).	1.8940972366905435
In the light of these conceptions it is hypothesized that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender (female-female psychoanalyses) a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre-oedipal mother-daughter-relationship are revided.	1.7219469983897022
Case vignettes and a literary example illustrate the risks as well as possible resolutions engendered by these early relationship dynamics, as these are reactivated in the here and now of the analyst's relationship towards her patient.	1.8643796736550078
There has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years.	2.8365639217743004
Over a five year period 126 patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated.	2.4210730000881853
Out of these 39 (30.9%) sustained additional peripelvic injuries and represent the study sample.	1.9613390912245143
Type B injuries according to the AO classification occurred in 16 (41%) patients, type C fractures in 23 (59%) patients.	2.3113790129312197
The spleen, liver and kidney were the most frequently injured organs (58.9%), followed by urogenital lesions (46.6%), nerve injuries (25.6%) and vascular lesions (15.3%).	2.0704547877287722
The most common extrapelvic lesions were thoracic injuries in 56.4% and severe head injuries (GCS<8) in 33.3%.	1.9208364902727189
The mean Hannover Polytraumascore was 35.6 points, the mean Injury Severity Score 27.6 points.	2.0956457747272363
Osteosnthesis was performed in 21 pelvic ring fractures (53%), eight procedures (50%) in type B fractures and 13 (56%) in type C fractures.	2.313676957474375
In type B injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases, in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case.	2.464154987518536
In type C injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients.	2.291958955515214
In four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral bars.	2.049560481188896
Three patients had their additional acetabular fracture plated through a anterior approach.	2.0033742264317476
All surviving 28 patients were followed up for an average of 18 months (range 7--59 months) after the trauma.	2.592014706036689
The patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the German Society of Trauma Surgery.	2.2937999447262007
53.4% of the type B fractures showed a good clinical outcome, 47.6% a poor outcome.	2.3759770053267824
15.4% with type C fractures presented with a good outcome, 84.6% with a poor outcome.	2.3873863516958185
80% of the type B and 23% of the type C fractures had a good radiological outcome.	2.41251886078375
20% of type B and 77% of type C injuries had a poor radiological outcome.	2.424955875272909
Five patients (12.8%) sustained persistent urological symptoms.	2.1589091743463396
Three of these had urinary dysfunction, two used permanent cystotomies due to their severe neurolgical deficit after a head injury.	1.913752648352239
Ten patients with nerve injuries at the time of trauma suffered long term neurological dysfunction of the lumbosacral plexus.	2.2712750477624226
The mortality rate was 28%.	2.629589326187671
Seven patients died in the emergency room due to uncontrollable bleeding, four in the intensive care unit from multi-organ failure.	2.1669234743573784
The management of complex pelvic trauma consists of fracture treatment and interdisciplinary treatment of the associated injury.	2.2618725573235094
Lesions of the abdominal organs or of major vessels must be addressed first if hemodynamic instability is present.	2.03293233759099
Injuries to smaller vessels can be embolized percutaneously.	2.229511057411954
Urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency, urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks .We recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression.	2.1984807173745713
If this is contraindicated due to an open fracture external fixation is the treatment of choice.	2.553275151072318
Type C fractures require posterior ring stabilization which should be postponed until four days post admission.	2.0579209957480087
Dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with two different psychopathological syndromes - impulsive aggressivity resulting form a lack of stimulation of the "behavior inhibition system" on the one hand and the manifestation of clinical depression and compulsive syndromes on the other.	1.9555575240211143
The examination of primate behavior provides a model which may reconciliate these seemingly contradictory hypotheses.	1.9702253747261689
According to primate experiments, monoaminergic depletion results in anxious and desperate behavior only if the individual has previously been exposed to social isolation stress, which in turn induces a decrease in the central serotonin turnover rate.	1.9247117522819681
Young non-human primates who experience early social separation stress are anxious and fearful, while as adults they tend to be aggressive, consume excessive amounts of alcohol and are less intoxicated by alcohol intake.	1.7520474107997452
These observation indicate the importance of social separation stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and antisocial behavior and may point to prophylactic and pharmacological treatment strategies.	2.2551251514430004
The implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses (PCL) leads to greater trauma to the eye than endocapsular PCL implantation.	1.8881939688182676
Persistent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long-term prognosis.	2.4374798115968037
Using laser-tyndallometry, we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long-term postoperative course for both surgical procedures.	2.4549886231681217
During the first 3 postoperative days, flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured PCL than in the conventional PCL group.	2.3663531106669855
Cell counts after transscleral suture fixation (27.7 +/- 18.3/0.075 mm3) decreased slightly during the first 5 postoperative days.	1.881882366868794
In contrast, the conventional PCL group regained the preoperative level (2.5 +/- 5.1) after 3 days.	1.9768310584959392
After 3 months, no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups.	2.2849009548445154
After implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses, breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional PCL implantation.	1.9262716342630406
However, the barrier function was re-established equally in both groups in the long term.	2.3294208229446736
No signs of a persistent disorder of the barrier were found.	2.629011378912684
There is clear evidence for obstructive sleep apnea as an independent cause of arterial hypertension.	2.2974095360652185
We report a case of intracranial hemorrhage with systemic hypertension resistant to antihypertensive medication, which could only be adjusted after effective treatment of coexisting sleep-disordered breathing.	2.053493881119928
The 36 year old male (body mass index 31 kg/m2) was admitted to hospital three weeks before for intracranial bleeding at the left external capsule.	2.021634803777959
Diagnosis of primary hypertension was made after extensive work-up in the acute hospital.	2.741057810137496
Blood pressure was adjusted with five-fold antihypertensive medication at the time of admission to neurological rehabilitation, but was still elevated with "non-dipping" as determined by long-term measurement despite medications above the recommended dosages.	2.1575271314832007
Polysomnography confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.	3.0778899224719765
10 days after initiation of treatment with nasal CPAP blood pressure control was easier with normal dipping at night.	2.1294853541413215
Medication could be reduced during rehabilitation with further reduction after discharge.	2.3382842295024884
Moderate obstructive sleep apnea appears to be the cause of severe hypertension resistant to pharmacological therapy in this patient.	2.66576059263573
The case underlines the impact of diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing for the secondary prevention of stroke.	2.571725860195571
This is demonstrated in a case of tuberculosis of the hip treated in the Dept.	2.841171550076461
of Trauma Surgery in collaboration with the Medical Dept.	2.3749029938697057
Microbiological and imaging examinations are essential to plan and perform a combined therapy of hip arthroplasty and concomittant medical antituberculous therapy.	2.112759012279505
In accordance to a literature review, this procedure proved successful for both eliminating the local infection and the functional outcome of the operation.	2.447882172330691
The purpose of our studies was to investigate experimentally the dose-dependent effects of extracorporeal shock waves on tendon and bone and to unveil therapeutic possibilities in tendopathies and pseudarthroses.	1.958400934341447
From January 1994 to January 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy as a result of endophthalmitis.	2.353409670868494
The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the visual outcome of surgical treatment.	2.5385769908443465
Tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long-term ventilated ICU patients.	2.830009428524498
In the last few years, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy.	2.316005512108504
Recently, there is another percutaneous technique according to Fantoni with translaryngeal airway access (TLT) available.	2.0767390199663507
Our study seeks to evaluate TLT in terms of complications and practicability.	2.4199952794240884
In 47 patients of our surgical ICU, elective TLT was performed.	2.218005286273438
Mean operative time was 9.8 +/- 10.9 (range 6-27) minutes.	2.1138817059953205
Severe complications, such as bleeding, aspiration or infection of the tracheostoma have never been noted.	2.4500761241989006
A slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in 25 patients intraoperatively, demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily.	1.9492616657342838
However, no patient became hypoxic during the procedure.Since during the procedure gas exchange may worsen, TLT should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80%.	1.9868383227389017
Despite the fact that severe complications associated with TLT have recently not yet been reported, physicians who perform TLT should be well-trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy, too.	2.1311215484142445
According to our present data, TLT seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to PDT.	2.3520475042221607
Nevertheless, for a definiteve evaluation of TLT, further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary.	2.7267034649641677
There are no direct associations between testosterone levels and sexual function in the aging male.	2.1297885764755167
A study of 169 patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions.	2.1296864145464216
In volunteers, in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of GnRH, no alteration in sexual reactions occurred.	2.2340133433968674
It is possible that other testosterone fractions are more meaningful than the total testosterone.	2.0347814070886625
However, all the known fractions correlate closely.	2.3153267687881205
The significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now.	2.2924552638918074
In an animal experiment, the intracavernous pressure, the density of -receptors, and the PDES activity depended on normal testosterone levels.	2.171357323990726
It is not known whether different testosterone levels influence the effectiveness of treatment procedures for erectile dysfunction in humans.	2.190264663630401
In a 65 years old male patient 38 cc of a 7.45% potassium chloride-solution was inadvertently infused within 3 hours into an epidural catheter on the first postoperative day.	1.9962785838995118
The epidural potassium chloride administration resulted in a paresis and painful paraesthesia of the patient's legs and a level of sensory blockade to TH 11.	2.064907542537074
Furthermore vegetative symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia were observed.	2.1724269143500368
For therapy a single bolus of 40 mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously followed by an epidural infusion of sodiumchloride 0,9% 99 cc/h for several hours.	1.9101650647125505
About 6 hours after the start of infusion all symptoms had disappeared.	2.2453126221482966
It is proposed that the use of colour-coded epidural catheter devices and coloured electrolyte solutions as well as infusion-pumps with a larger reservoir that reduce the frequency of syringe changes would be helpful in avoiding such complications.	2.2626613701775047
This paper reviews respiratory muscle/circulation interaction in congestive heart failure.	1.9638241438702795
Respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure - generating capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients.	1.975364814359211
The mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented.	2.646268265868564
Not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients, but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation, such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	2.2420374945014907
The underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed.	1.9394308295419957
Traumatic, perilunate dislocations are rare lesions, and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures.	2.519328325791038
Unfortunately, one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized, although conventional X-rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48% of cases, which can be improved by performing CT or bone scan in addition to 62% and 95%, repectively.	2.1081904879802598
Forced extension seems to be the most frequent trauma mechanism.	3.15500577173617
The treatment consists of open reduction, predominantly of the lunate bone, and internal fixation.	2.4814815372513714
Huge carpal fragments such as the scaphoid and capitatum are ideally fixed by means of compression screws, while smaller fragments can only be aligned with Kirschner wires.	2.2450105081421294
Osteochondral chips are best reinserted into the bone by means of anchoring systems.	2.4158988342728613
In cases of complex carpal instability supplementary stabilization may be achieved with an external fixator.	2.288600846019565
The best results on the Martini evaluation score were achieved in simple perilunate dislocations that were reset early by open surgical procedures and were accompanied by minimal involvement of/damage to different tissues.	1.7979508350923605
Although we had a nonunion rate of approximately 20% in our series of 11 mixed traumatized patients in all, the Martini classification of hand function seems to be a reliable score system for practical clinical follow-ups.	2.1455174429895996
Maternal anxiety in the event of a false positive result is an argument against universal hearing screening in newborns.	2.020755588459365
The aim of this study was to investigate the mothers' attitudes towards neonatal hearing screening and their anxiety in case of a positive result.	2.1848546982145294
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN-) were both administered subcutaneously (SC) in combination with intravenously (IV) applied 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma (RCC).	2.570670570580626
The therapy protocol consisted of a treatment cycle of 8 weeks, which could be carried out in an outpatient regimen.	2.5485604543780775
The IFN- was given in each of the 8 weeks (6-9 MU/m2 once to three times weekly SC) combined sequentially with IL-2 (5-20 MU/m2 three times weekly SC for 4 weeks) and 5-FU (750 mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks).	2.2457003858063023
Among the 30 consecutive patients treated, in 2 cases a complete, and in 9 cases a partial, remission was achieved in patients with mostly lung and skeletal metastases, with an overall objective response rate of 37 %.	2.371744489820444
Mean response duration was 8 months (range 3-18 months).	2.4249074775981136
A stable state of the disease lasting 3-18 months was observed in 10 cases.	3.07042483229751
The side effects were only slight and corresponded to toxicity grade I (n = 2), grade II (n = 22) and grade III (n = 6), according to the WHO classification.	2.470078122995883
In conclusion, this triple-drug biochemotherapy demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness comparable with that of an aggressive IL-2 treatment regimen (applied IV), but without its high toxicity.	2.0606980879544157
Compression therapy was employed for 4 weeks 20 patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage CVI I and CVI II according to Widmer's classification.	2.3457102472873252
Compression bandaging for 2 weeks was followed by compression stockings for 2 more weeks.	2.078610713546356
Marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after 4 weeks, along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume.	2.301957726793185
Video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and pericapillary halo diameter.	2.449802802690074
Compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation.	2.562730612970951
The efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar.	2.125482600539812
The splanchnic perfusion is reduced early in the course of any shock.	2.5375683204930852
The mucosa of the gut suffers most as it experiences a high oxygen demand even in the steady state.	2.125589726575102
The specific arrangement of the micro vessels within the villus of the mucosa exposes the tip of the villus at the highest risk for ischemia, particularly in low flow states.	1.9842845174524757
As a consequence the integrity of the mucosal layer is compromised and dysfunction of the mucosal barrier may allow bacteria and toxins to translocate from the gut lumen.	1.9411489033279943
Activation of leukocytes and stimulation of cytokine synthesis may comprise a sustained inflammatory response syndrome.	2.0828136775586112
So far there is a good body of evidence that the splanchnic region may play an important role in the pathophysiological sequence from shock to organ dysfunction.	2.3077526616754627
As pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current, the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current.	2.019765584088987
Whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow-up, was studied in 87 patients who received the VDD-single lead UniPass 425 connected to the pacemaker Unity (Sulzer Intermedics).	1.9229174575488617
The impedance changes between implantation and 6 months follow-up were assessed for each patient.	2.5857537773117483
Similar impedance values were defined, if the two measurements were within a range <= -100 to +100 .	2.290589478610718
Six-months impedance was lower or higher compared to implantation, if the difference exceeded > -100 or > +100 .	2.104767829415589
At implantation, impedance was 535  +/-  98  (range: 333-811 ) and significantly increased to 604  +/-  160  (range: 361-1150 ) after 6 months.	1.7745116916205768
Mean difference between the two measurements was 69  +/-  162  (range: -336 bis +560 ).	2.170074139447073
Similar impedance had 43 (implantation: 527  +/-  75 , 6 months: 531  +/-  87 ), lower values 11 (implantation: 660  +/-  83 , 6 months: 494  +/-  73 ) and higher values 33 patients (implantation: 503  +/-  99 , 6 months: 735  +/-  168 ).	1.7881993874365834
Compared to the patients with similar impedance patients with lower impedance had a significantly higher impedance values at implantation.	2.3622534862248097
Conclusions: Pacing impedance increased significantly within 6 months after implantation.	2.380725554592131
Pacing impedance changed > 100  in 51% of the patients.	2.594317651621417
The long-term follow-up of pacing impedance can be predicted generally, but not for the individual patient.	2.50425641452911
Endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis.	2.2869115675014418
The aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) release following a local endothelial injury during PTCA (group A) and after sustained myocardial ischemia (group B).	2.0430235764919744
Additionally, the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed.	1.9969797557679063
Since first described in the early 1990s, coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has evolved as a promising noninvasive modality for imaging of the coronary arteries and evaluation of coronary artery disease.	2.432202053867674
Despite technical limitations, coronary MRA has established value for imaging of anomalous coronary artery and assessment of bypass graft patency.	2.124689390471649
Current research focuses on the development of optimal respiratory compensation strategies, improved spatial and temporal resolution and faster acquisition of image data.	2.2621652647550903
The accurate detection of stenoses and assessment of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis is presently being evaluated with large multicenter studies.	2.4897573971185936
With further technique enhancements and more clinical experience, coronary MRA is likely to become the dominant noninvasive modality in clinical cardiology.	2.058834616105335
Which consequences can be ascribed to the intraarticular position of devices in the operative treatment of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis?	2.2504852067276544
Which steps are to define as a standard of a careful procedure?	2.633048370755058
A digitised three-dimensional (3-D) image of the face has many valuable uses.	2.816869250950151
These include accurate measurements of facial morphology, clinical documentation and objective analyses of surgical procedures.	2.0877222616568667
A new system presented here, based on stereophotogrammetric techniques, instantaneously captures digitised images using high-resolution cameras.	2.121366141240832
It has an accuracy of more than 0.5 mm RMS and creates the 3-D image from approximately 20,000 points.	2.1482928161114985
The principles of the image capturing are demonstrated and the potential uses discussed.	2.189373162089772
Surgical changes of the soft tissue in two patients following orthognathic surgery are also illustrated.	2.7854813099340077
This new capturing and measurement system provides a simple method of determining 3-D changes in soft tissue following surgery and is a useful tool for clinical purposes.	2.170761061992558
A potential impact of tricyclic antidepressants on oral anticoagulation is controversial.	2.0527555269550737
Phenprocoumon - the most commonly used anticoagulant in Germany - is rarely considered in clinical trials.	2.3452730868696774
In the present study, a potential drug-drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics, causing an alteration in prothrombinemic effects, has been investigated.	2.0010404882181856
To analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments, especially the disc, after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with AO internal fixator, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the traumatised region after implant removal.	2.1243303022686586
There were two aspects of disc degeneration (DD): (1) biochemical changes and (2) structural damage.	2.3604315691417064
MRI detects biochemical processes as one aspect of DD that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture.	2.1157575951775254
None of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus, which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability.	2.7701634590709627
We observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture-adjacent discs and alterations of discal shape more often in the upper of the two, whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree.	2.142500457284793
Our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation.	1.805363051551747
With regard to the upper disc, the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised.	2.2379262893842147
The question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone.	2.2756904174453467
Besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by MRI, a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions.	2.233784951432483
To study the frequency and clinical aspects of cold urticaria in Central Europe, patient data from a university dermatology clinic and a private dermatology office between 1984-94 were analysed and the patients reexamined if possible.	1.9897207196847506
Of the 56 patients with cold urticaria (31 women, 25 men), 49 had idiopathic cold urticaria.	1.9667094369737257
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 year, the mean duration of disease 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.	2.1984181750029523
Atopy was found in 46.5% of patients, and 23.2% of the patients suffered from other types of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced).	2.321583786946133
Laboratory examinations were only rarely abnormal.	2.524311777914012
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with generally only moderate symptomatic improvement.	2.628994264361909
Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin, 1-2 mil IU/d over 2-4 weeks, n=18, or tetracyclines, 2 g/d over 2 weeks, n=10) induced full remission in 13 patients and symptomatic improvement in 8.	2.092008806614138
During an average of 6.5 year-follow-up, 20 of 43 symptomatic patients went into spontaneous remission.	2.4428143962557067
The good therapeutic response to antibiotics in this study underlines the need for a better elucidation of the cause of cold urticaria, in view of possible infectious causes.	2.4565989800460475
Background: Since its first implantation as an eyeball replacement in the United States in 1985, hydroxyapatite has been rarely used as an orbital implant in Germany.	1.9966468932933619
The aim of the study was to collect data on long-term tolerance, postoperative complications and the cosmetic end results.	2.325736839312582
A 37-year-old woman had intensive care for 105 days and artificial ventilation for 72 days because of a lung transplantation and multiple postoperative complications.	2.190966058335396
She developed severe heterotopic ossification of both shoulders, the right elbow and both hip joints.	2.064405056921119
Owing to complete joint stiffness, she was immobilized and unable to eat or drink without help.	1.8886172500826464
Operative treatment was performed in two procedures.	2.7554611191189586
The right shoulder and right elbow were operated on first; the right hip and later the left hip were operated on after recovery from the previous surgical procedures.	2.135885769769053
After 22 months, there was a good functional result; the patient took part in all activities of daily life and was pain-free.	2.282020801821052
The present knowledge on heterotopic ossifications is summarized, as well as possible prophylactic measurements.	2.3939972054129437
Background: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is one of the most common forms of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population.	2.1978374281612383
Patients and methods: 41 children with a mean age of 9.6 (3.7-16) years with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) refractory to medical treatment (n=38) and recurrent syncope (n=3) underwent electrophysiologic (EP) study.	1.8559800816565932
In all patients dual AV-nodal physiology could be demonstrated during EP study and typical form of AVNRT (mean heart rate 220/min) could be induced by programmed atrial stimulation.	1.989709099417049
A steerable 7 F ablation catheter was placed at the inferoparaseptal region of the tricupid valve annulus close to the orifice of the coronary sinus with the intention to record a late fractionated local atrial electrogram during sinus rhythm.	2.0036424705781757
Starting at this point radiofrequency current (500 kHz) with a target temperature of 70 °C was delivered with the intention to ablate the slow pathway.	2.114558331343682
If a slowly accelerated junctional rhythm (<120/min) occurred during energy discharge, programmed atrial stimulation was repeated.	2.015656605192071
Otherwise radiofrequency current was delivered step by step up to a septal position next to the tricuspid valve annulus.	2.01354023178872
Slow pathway ablation was defined as lack of evidence of dual AV nodal pathways during repeated atrial stimulation.	2.1373152315825936
Slow pathway modulation was defined as maximal one atrial echoimpulse after ablation.	2.1635422933388866
Results: The number of energy applications ranged from 1-19 (median 6).	2.3339105168993495
In 35/41 patients slow pathway ablation could be achieved; in six patients the slow pathway was modulated.	2.1940875766309484
In none of the patients permanent high grade AV block was observed.	2.8087512487458253
During follow-up (mean 4.1 years) two patients had a recurrent episode of AVNRT after slow pathway modulation.	2.3054014264985945
All other patients are still free of AVNRT without medical treatment.	2.239130162993539
Conclusion: Selective radiofrequency current ablation/modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of AVNRT in young patients.	2.0810873197964144
Since we had the impression that there was an increase in blood loss during mammaplasties after a change in the anesthesiology department responsible, we conducted a study to compare 28 cases from each anesthesiology department.	2.257908714241027
All operations were carried out by the first author in succession using the same operative technique.	2.4398044329933377
The two groups did not differ in age, BMI, operative time, weight of resected tissue or preoperative laboratory.	2.171263158355026
Blood loss was calculated from the perioperative drop in hemoglobin and patient's blood volume.	2.1265638578803214
Blood pressure, heart rate, medication and intravenous fluid supply were obtained from the anesthetic protocols.	2.248965428314344
Results (means and standard deviations): Group I (n = 28) and [Group II (n = 28)]: total resected tissue 1862  +/-  928 g [1912  +/-  791 g]; Hb-preop.	1.819192000133467
13.6  +/-  0.9 g/dl [13.8  +/-  0.8 g/dl]; Hb-postop.	2.306183363795437
After exclusion of surgical or biological causes hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic techniques were suspected as the reason for the significant difference in blood loss.	2.3294135016761794
MAP was elevated only initially, while the heart rate was considerably elevated throughout the procedures in group II.	2.444606415344451
During anesthesia with nitrous oxide and enflurane, the dose of enflurane in group I could be limited to 0.3-0.5 % after initial i. v. administration of 60 to 100 µg sufentanil, while in group II without opioids doses of 0.5-2 % were required.	2.093845082591098
The well-known dose-dependend effect of enflurane on the peripheral vascular tone was not masked by vasoconstrictors at the operative site.	2.003508623088632
Conclusions: Blood loss during mammaplasties can be affected considerably by the anaesthetic technique - even without deliberate hypotension.	1.9852641666252155
Sufentanil can indirectly reduce the blood loss by lowering the necessary dose of enflurane.	2.2570194664161787
Blood transfusions can be avoided at mammaplasties.	2.580523317762615
Continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine with the opioid fentanyl represents an effective analgesic method in the therapy of strong postoperative pain after major surgery.	2.1978984005983975
Preparation of the required infusion solution in syringes with a volume of 50 ml immediately prior to administration is routinely performed by nursing staff in Germany.	1.8946025072059332
The effort required for the preparation is associated with logistical and pharmaceutical difficulties.	2.429562789079358
The preparation of a mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% in 250 ml infusion bags at the pharmacy of the University Hospital Mainz is described.	1.8346727897846462
To determine the physicochemical stability, the concentration of bupivacaine-HCl and fentanyl was assessed using HPLC over a period of 32 days; in addition the pH values were determined.	2.044137314409994
After 32 days 95% of the bupivacaine hydrochloride and fentanyl baseline values were recorded.	2.107752079745187
The pH baseline value had decreased from 5.48-5.52 to 0.5-0.7 units.	1.917730507287948
The measured values confirm the physicochemical stability of the mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% over a period of 32 days.	2.0327831618940975
The infusion bag can be stored for 4 weeks at room temperature.	2.2438480530631315
The programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult, especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory loudness (MAL) needs to be determined.	1.9929685681138698
Excessively high stimulation should be avoided as this can have a traumatic effect.	2.3855081985659683
The aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold (ESRT) and the postoperatively determined MAL and hearing threshold for 27 patients, each having one of three implant types.	1.7809010491064396
The question of whether the ESRT provides a practical technique to simplify, improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated.	1.798524551147556
For the monopolar stimulation mode used for the Med-El and Clarion implant systems, the average MAL and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average ESRT across all electrodes.	1.9272218082267658
For the "common ground" stimulation mode used for the Nucleus implant system, a parabolic transformation was used to relate MAL and ESRT to one another.	1.9925842778180902
These transformations between MAL values calculated from the ESRT and the actual MAL values, determined psychoacoustically, diverged considerably from one another.	1.8762400196855573
Therefore, it was not possible to determine the MAL from the ESRT with certainty.	2.658919872577235
The ESRT does, however, provide a means to estimate an approximate upper boundary for the MAL, apart from its use to control implant function.	2.088194595634541
The determination of the exact MAL will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques.	2.4425302815463428
Movements and vibrations of intraocular structures can be observed during vitrectomy with mechanical cutting systems.	2.181065677594689
We experimentally compared these intraocular motion artifacts between mechanical and erbium:YAG laser vitrectomy.	1.9227864183703478
Spontaneous rupture und false aneurysms of the non-arteriosclerotic aorta are rare.	2.343238098963058
We report on a 53-year-old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by semicircumferential aortic end-to-end anastomosis.	2.012807148939221
After 6 months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft, transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch.	1.8875878701679696
The iliac reconstruction was performed by PTFE interposition.	2.7539740164553477
There was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis.	2.385532842353553
At 1 year follow-up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms.	3.185943382614318
In this biomechanical study the implanted Unreamed Humeral Nail (UHN) has been tested concerning bending and torsional stiffnesses.	2.009402331022859
In literature other intramedullary implants have been critisized for insufficient rotatory stability especially in transverse and short oblique fractures of the humeral shaft.	2.018714937930323
This study examined, whether the implanted UHN, as well as the UHN implanted with interfragmentary compression through a specific compression device, is able to augment torsional stiffness significantly.	2.155181457738512
To evaluate bending and torsional stiffnesses, the UHN has been compared biomechanically to the Russell-Taylor humeral nail (RT) in paired mid-shaft osteotomized cadaveric humeri.	1.6725666371098389
Identic paired comparison has been performed with the UHN without and UHN with interfragmentary compression.	2.2056607103691674
In anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction stiffness under four-point-bending is significantly higher in stabilizing with the RT.	2.1095696955155083
Under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm and 8 Nm the UHN reached more than the double torsional stiffness.	1.8282951486370018
The RT, which is only dynamically interlocked, owns a high initial "play" between bolts and nail itself.	2.109126642513824
Through additional interfragmentary compression stiffness of the UHN under four-point-bending in anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction augments significantly.	1.9513012006149162
Also under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm und 8 Nm torsional stiffness increases with interfragmentary compression significantly.	1.757717725496814
In comparison to other biomechanical studies of different autorship it is clear, that this statically interlocked intramedullary nailing of the humeral shaft is superior to non-statically interlocked types of nailing concerning their stabilizing potency in torsion and serves especially for fracture types, which are critically under rotation, as transverse or short oblique humeral shaft fractures.	1.872361893861782
While the different national health systems merge structurally, cost expansion in health care is a global challenge.	1.9810275318076902
Structural reforms have been developed during recent years in the USA which can be summarized as "managed care".	2.608588204874868
They are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system, in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economical goods.	2.1919154058995542
In managed-care models, patients are deliberately directed to the most economic forms of therapy.	2.318582096235265
The spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines, which lead to a standardization of processes.	2.255833917135337
Financing and medical executive responsibilities fuse.	2.417649454727143
The autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to enforce an integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system.	2.028670151936063
Leadership is no longer primarily confined to doctors or scientists.	2.3796443249233636
It is progressively shifting to financing institutions, managing directors or insurance companies.	1.908478369911187
Structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the U. S. and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs.	1.802645325218628
Historical development, current concepts of US-managed care, its potential influence and general applicability to the German situation are discussed in an overview.	2.203413985291702
On the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy, and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis.	2.254621155680049
In the early 1980s, a peptide that caused diuresis, natriuresis, and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups.	1.84558941420568
This was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides, followed by the characterisation of the amino-acid sequences of several species.	2.181656036374456
Synthesis of the peptide, cloning of the encoding gene, identification and characterisation of specific receptors, as well as the development of antibodies and radioimmunoassays were rapidly accomplished.	2.2352082259225017
Research on the immunohistochemistry of cardiodilatin/atrial natriuretic peptide (CDD/ANP) and the regulation of CDD/ANP gene expression led to detection of the peptide in extra-atrial tissues.	2.101149307175574
Later on, two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).	2.0021309176769746
These peptides share structural features with CDD/ANP with regard to their 17-amino-acid-exhibiting loop bridged by a disulfide bond.	1.978080532678598
Another recently discovered peptide is urodilatin (URO), a renal-borne new member of A-type natriuretic peptide.	2.041766325252972
URO was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as CDD/ANP, containing the 17-amino-acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with 4 additional amino acids located at the NH2-terminus of the peptide.	1.8790229454551792
Regarding physiological actions, data strongly support a close association between URO and urinary sodium excretion.	1.9395540008314232
The application of URO in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to CDD/ANP-99-126.	1.9045991880681945
These results were encouraging for the use of URO in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure (ARF) in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of incipient ARF in patients following liver transplantation.	2.263673926966922
Summarising the results of these two studies, URO represents a new approach for not only prevention, but also for treatment of ARF following organ transplantation.	2.6923248929376533
This opens up new possibilities for the treatment of ARF of other origins in intensive care medicine.	2.372920903142448
Dermatomyositis in a 7 year old girl was diagnosed two months prior to admission to our pediatric rheumatology program.	2.1839577300648387
Serological and molecular biology methods were used to investigate the evidence for a recent coxsackie-B-virusinfection.	2.453413647207268
Objectives Wide approach to the posterior aspect of the scapula for internal fixation of unstable fractures of neck of scapula and glenoid.	2.3016169214205617
The guideline "Joint Swelling" is addressed to primary care physicians - general practitioners, internists or orthopedists without special experience in rheumatology.	1.8195855362083269
It provides a framework for interviewing patients, as well as for physical, laboratory and imaging examinations and for selection of treatment appropriate to the level of primary care.	2.3526647786942725
Situations which call for urgent evaluation and criteria for referral to rheumatologists are described.	2.058923321610051
The appendix contains comments on signs and symptoms to differentiate arthralgia from joint swelling and on the diagnostic value of a history of joint swelling without confirmation by the physician.	2.2323720456132894
Further recommendations for the evaluation of patient history and physical and technical examinations are given in a tabular form.	2.372190472205299
The significance of laboratory and imaging procedures is discussed.	2.285074484956079
Introduction: Bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy occur twice to three times more frequently than after an open procedure.	2.1333952750097525
Four different types of lesions may be differentiated by the Siewert classification: postoperative bile fistulas (type I), late strictures (type II), tangential injuries of the bile duct (type III) and defect lesions (type IV).	2.109936511062481
The diagnostic and therapeutic management is demonstrated in relation to our own experience and the literature.	2.964620799010275
Methods: Eleven patients (median age 43.8  +/-  17.2) with bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were operatively treated between November 1993 and December 1998.	1.9511351923760072
Nine patients (four type-II lesions, five type-IV lesions) were referred from another hospital; 2 defect lesions out of 410 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (0.5 %) were documented in our own patient group.	1.8614307526457745
Results: Four patients with late strictures were operatively treated with a hepaticocholedochostomy (n = 2) or hepaticojejunostomy (n = 2) after 14.3  +/-  8.4 months and were discharged from hospital after 10.6  +/-  3.8 days.	1.995385376363008
However, a retrocolic Roux-Y end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy was perfomed in all cases with a larger defect (n = 5; hospital stay 14.8  +/-  2.0 days).	2.052109354699289
The two defect lesions in our own group were detected by intraoperative cholangiography and immediately treated after conversion either with hepaticocholedocho-stomy or hepaticojejunostomy (hospital stay 11.2  +/-  0.6 days).	1.8428559916121507
Conclusions: The incidence of bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be kept down by anatomic preparation, selective intraoperative cholangiography and early consideration of conversion to open procedure.	1.9538875769914685
The clinical course after biliary tract injury can be positively influenced only by a standard diagnostic and operative procedure and by an early transfer to a specialized center.	1.9356359293210497
In the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma diagnosis increased about 15-20 %.	2.5995528181044416
The main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence.	2.554398568138272
In the present autopsy series comprising 23.801 autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1,77 % in Jena and 1,55 % in Königgrätz (200.000 inhabitants each).	1.993353108205054
Over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased.	2.615963828871274
With the advent of atypical antipsychotics, quality of life for patients with schizophrenia has improved significantly.	2.6098445638959915
The positive effects are based not only on the compliance-enhancing reduction of extrapyramidal side effects but also due to improved cognitive function and social integration, shorter duration, and overall reduction of hospital treatment.	1.924258309339045
The mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction is still high and according to recently published data amounts to 17 to 42%.	2.0133267213301154
In the seventies introduction of thrombolytic therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality of non-perioperative myocardial infarction.	2.5897578301883994
However, in the perioperative situation thrombolytic therapy remains to be problematic in most cases because of expected severe bleeding complications.	2.250959454990214
In the last 4-6 years acute-PTCA has been established in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction.	2.5330670369923163
Up to date no data are available concerning the effect of acute-PTCA on mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	2.3384759810584734
Nevertheless it can be assumed, that acute-PTCA will lead to a considerable reduction in mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	2.529938309285783
Therefore, in patients with significant perioperative myocardial infarction immediate coronary angiography and, if indicated, acute-PTCA should be performed.	2.641369239997637
In principle, thrombolytic therapy is considered to be contraindicated in the intra- or postoperative situation.	2.409818148442491
However, if coronary angiography and PTCA are not possible, thrombolysis might be taken into consideration, in particular if the expected bleeding complications are small in relation to the expected benefit of thrombolysis.	2.268691394515549
Since acute-PTCA has been shown to remarkably reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction, this group of patients should be especially considered.	2.8501113759628884
Medical theories and practices concerning illness and health in old age as well as several aspects of society that do influence the aging process are described from a historical perspective integrating classical antiquity, middle ages, and modern times.	1.9542208279709004
From the present state of research it is distinguished between "primary illnesses in old age" and chronical diseases which might principally also begin in younger ages but take a different course in old age.	1.8798853830098181
Even if the frequency of disease and multimorbidity is increasing, negative stereotypes of the aging process have to be invalidated.	2.490766176059698
Advances in medical sciences are a good pre-condition for increasing physical and mental health in old age.	1.9596844050883682
The analysis of wall motion abnormalities with dobutamine stress echocardiography is an established method for the detection of myocardial ischemia.	2.41647472431031
With ultrafast magnetic resonance tomography, the application of identical stress protocols as used for echocardiography is possible.	2.293009643225598
Transvaginal ultrasound provides an early and accurate technique to assess first trimester pregnancy.	2.14805272963642
Beginning with the demonstration of an intrauterine gestational sac, sonography enables further evaluation of normal pregnancy development, such as identification of the embryo, visualization of the yolk sac, and the presence of fetal cardiac activity as a reassurance of fetal viability.	2.284522855819443
Furthermore it allows closed sonographic monitoring of early intrauterine pregnancy and distinction between normal and abnormal development of pregnancy.	2.0131032215046476
A prediction in terms of pregnancy outcome can be made regarding pregnancy complications or specific risks like vaginal bleeding, the demonstration of intrauterine hematoma, advanced maternal age, early growth delay or fetal bradycardia.	2.019479321933185
Because of the marked heterogeneity of patient groups and the diverse causes of obstruction, surgical therapy of the small-bowel ileus is difficult to standardize.	2.330216203208978
A homogeneous strategy of intraoperative handling of the obstructed bowel (decompression, endoluminal splinting) as well as abdominal closure would be desirable.	2.1301963057775386
Adhesiolysis remains the most common procedure.	3.432565728899067
Small bowel plication is still used by a minority of surgeons with the Noble's technique replaced by the Child-Phillips' technique and its modifications.	1.9435158238414527
However, as a result of the lack of controlled studies, there is no large body of evidence available to support the use of plication, long tubes or any other specific surgical intervention.	2.5507125405924636
This is an important task for the future, especially in view of incidence and economic importance of small bowel-ileus.	2.7471530008418314
Purpose: The purpose of our study was to determine the value of MRI in monitoring laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) of cerebral neoplasms.	2.225630073486868
A 70-year-old woman with severely symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was unresponsive to drug treatment.	2.1913211508198085
She had recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and syncope and was at high risk for sudden death; a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator (DDD-ICS) was implanted.	1.9977989093727984
Her initial left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 80 mmHg and fell to 40 mmHg during dual-chamber pacing at an atrial ventricular delay of 140 ms.	1.88152430229139
In the follow-up over six months she was asymptomatic with respect to angina pectoris; ventricular tachycardias could be successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing or by shocks.	2.162244190805914
Morbihan's disease was first reported as a distinct entity in 1957 by Degos, describing a chronic persistent erythema and oedema of the upper half of the face.	2.2291220738513533
Such conditions have been noted in the literature designated as chronic lymphoedema or solid persistent facial oedema in acne or rosacea.	2.148216135195437
The characteristic features are a chronic course, a typical clinical picture, lack of specific laboratory and histological findings and refractoriness to therapeutic measures.	2.2836264182108423
Paediatric cardiac transplantation (pHTX) has gained widespread acceptance as a therapy in end-stage myocardial failure and some forms of congenital heart disease, particularly hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).	1.9469323239559597
The major problems to the anaesthesiologist in these patients are induction of anaesthesia in infants with HLHS and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the early post-bypass period.	2.657465120147401
Objective: Thirty years ago, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was primarily developed for otherwise healthy individuals who experienced sudden cardiac arrest.	2.05811392869463
Today, CPR is widely viewed as an emergency procedure that can be attempted on any person who undergoes a cessation of cardiorespiratory function.	2.065588150500894
Therefore, the appropriateness of CPR has been questioned as a matter of the outcome, the patient's preferences, and the cost.	2.6576081970470913
The objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital resuscitation.	2.1255202393854677
Arguments: CPR is bound by moral considerations that surround the use of any medical treatment.	2.2888333229193623
According to Beauchamp and Childress, the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories, principles, rules, and particular judgements and actions.	1.698720443527259
The decision to start CPR is based on the medical judgement that a person is suffering from circulatory arrest.	2.2255977415654953
The decision is justified by the moral rule that the victim of a cardiac arrest has the right to survive and to receive CPR.	1.9894267980458509
Moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles.	2.420647372807731
The principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare.	1.8968144597204806
Talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success, as many victims of pre- and in-hospital sudden death have been saved in the past.	2.081538097588251
Nevertheless, resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases, involving the principle of nonmaleficence.	2.46611028059713
There is potential harm in CPR.	2.351978608009044
Survivors may recover cardiac function, but sustain severe hypoxic brain damage, at worst surviving without awakening for months or years.	1.8457053727054453
In particular, post-traumatic CPR is associated with an extremely poor outcome, leading to the issue of futility.	2.5718625418789873
The time frame in CPR requires medical decision-making within seconds, and CPR is usually initiated without the patient's involvement.	1.904121240018326
If the patient's wish's can be ascertained later on, life-sustaining therapies might be withdrawn at that time.	2.005385729650031
Terminally ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no-CPR document, which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms, but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene.	1.8748416454092802
The decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit.	2.001675470788421
Conclusions: The standard of care remains the prompt initiation of CPR.	2.2645718448228624
However, ethical principles such as beneficene, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine.	2.1836926445363956
Physicians have to consider the therapeutic efficacy of CPR, the potential risks, and the patient's preferences.	3.081676743019461
Acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting-out.	2.476076825899454
Subtile behaviour, too, as a part of the "complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals" (Sandler) which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting-out or microacting-out (Treuniet).	1.9934706202404722
However, this delicate acting has no meaning, it is not symbolic or communicative action.	2.244311322178223
It is aimed at inducing effects and interactions.	2.324919956628524
It appears both on the side of the analyst and of the patient and is part of the unconscious communication in the therapeutic process.	2.9651160419036966
Diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated, how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way.	1.8912060155698147
The acting-reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations, by which he unintentionally demonstrates, in what a way he understands the patient.	1.8790751502503733
Background: The therapy of phimosis is circumcision.	2.4640425832241517
Since many years it has been discussed, whether phimosis is treatable with local estrogen application analogous to the treatment of labial synechia in girls.	2.250698666256319
This conservative treatment depends on the presence of estrogen receptors (er-alpha) in male prepuce-cells.	2.3455952438443894
Findings in previous investigations have indicated that contrast-enhanced colour Doppler can be used to improve the demonstration of characteristic features of neovascularization in malignancies.	2.294415497482526
However, the quantification of the increase in colour Doppler signals after Levovist in the cited study relied only on descriptive criteria defined by the investigator, resulting in a subjective scoring system.	1.9267165128350898
A computer-assisted method for quantitative analysis of colour pixel density is a novel approach for objective assessment of colour Doppler signal after contrast media administration.	1.9909698814184031
After microbubble contrast medium injection in 47 patients, carcinomas and benign lesions behaved differently regarding degree, onset and duration of Doppler enhancement.	1.9703140634398673
However, the high interindividual variability and the temporal variations of the Doppler signal still limit the value of these criteria for prospective diagnosis.	2.176956214717299
Rapid image-acquisition techniques are needed in order to apply the necessary mathematical processing before the contrast kinetics can be used for diagnostic purposes.	2.4257649364902196
Recent studies have shown that increased intraocular pressure following keratoplasty may cause progressive endothelial cell loss and thereby lead to early transplant failure.	1.9227490425125817
This study examined risk groups for development of postoperative glaucoma and thereby transplant failure.	2.0338955821316698
Dysphagia is a common complaint following surgical intervention in the oral cavity and hypopharynx, often leading to prolonged postoperative recovery.	2.2826717992626597
Videofluoroscopy allows detailed visualization of deglutition, demonstrating the morphology as well as the functional aspects.	2.4427381476665344
Therefore, videofluoroscopy provides the basis for further therapeutic management.	2.404239928019643
We discuss the pathology of deglutition in 19 patients recovering from tumor surgery of the oro- and hypopharynx.	2.192237396374673
In most cases the results demonstrated severe impairment of both the oral and pharyngeal phase of deglutition.	2.2015548581444375
Our data emphasize the importance of the oral phase of deglutition for preparation and initiation of the following phases.	2.7003070258506243
People who suffer a stroke most often experience a major crisis in their lives.	2.0337550401453846
This leads to psychological problems which are likely to influence the patient's life satisfaction, long-term rehabilitation outcome, and quality of life as much as the physical consequences caused by the stroke.	2.4470755371357704
The patient's ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential.	2.1418125689979624
This necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process, which unfolds in the same way as other experiences of vital threat, e.g.	2.0409504953021043
confrontation with one's own dying.	2.5437493207792303
Different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are nonacceptance of the facts, erupting emotions, parting with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one's future.	2.194859871249486
Whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages, but essentially on their persistence.	2.05292445963251
It is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior, stage-consistent interventions and a positive feedback.	1.8834260554126956
A failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having sufferd a stroke.	2.4021673763651523
A 63-year-old woman developed a pruritic exanthema on the extremities after one hour of work in her garden pond in Planegg, Southern Bavaria.	1.9027427375364427
As the appropriate vectors (ducks and snails) were present, we made the tentative diagnosis of cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch).	1.8526107951048905
By different serological methods (cercarial fluorescent antibody test, cercarial Hüllen reaction, circumoval precipitin test) antibodies against cercariae could be demonstrated in the serum of the patient 14 days later.	2.07253519206236
Cercarial dermatitis appears worldwide, but in Central Europe the disease is often not recognized.	2.5868924540683205
The current adjustment of cochlear implant (CI) speech processors is based on a knowledge of the lower and upper limits (T- and C-levels) for electrical stimulus currents.	2.2458433796979245
These data are usually acquired from subjective classifications of individual patients.	2.0923689139739206
In cases with non-reliable patient responses, objective methods are necessary.	2.1658377710101937
By determining the AEP of different latencies, late cortical responses can be registered almost without artifact contamination.	1.858383858071825
These patients have been examined in 20 patients provided with 22- or 8-channel CI-systems (Nucleus or Med-El implants).	2.099694807683261
In all cases, clear responses and clearly discernible threshold transitions could be detected.	2.178599434595378
By making use of acoustical stimulation in a free sound field, subjective hearing threshold and the T-levels of electrical stimulation could be verified.	1.9459719780878826
Since late responses are generated in the primary auditory cortex, their assessment permits a nearly integral functional control of the aided hearing system.	2.0035777461823763
To date, no problems have occured from maturation or attentional effects in either pediatric or adult patients.	1.8560937050589976
The applicability in very young children remains to be explored.	2.3002542524030316
Laparoscopic gastric banding has become a common procedure in bariatric surgery.	2.3561301546422393
Early as well as late complications are, in comparison to conventional techniques, rare.	3.1309778251079945
Complications arising from the operative technique are: perforation, early pouch dilatation, gastric slippage, infections of the port and the band, erosion and defects of the band tube.	2.0048811838549128
Insufficient weight loss and late pouch dilatation arise from unsatisfactory compliance on the part of the patient.	2.3574095052953945
In 7.5 % of 146 cases, reoperations were necessary.	2.205528098753633
Obstruction of the pouch stoma and a slippage resulted in total food intolerance.	2.1653145900431063
After radiologic diagnosis the band system should be deflated first and a naso-gastric tube applied.	1.9465902602142222
If this does not result in the pouch collapsing, a revision operation is needed.	2.3538338352177157
The significant legal and ecomonic ramifications of a positive drug test produce an incentive among users of illicit drugs to escape detection.	1.8028446707511625
Among these, the preferred strategy is to increase fluid intake and urine flow so as to dilute the concentration of drugs below the threshold of detection.	1.9809923165162115
To determine the extent of possible specimen dilution the urinary creatinine concentration is generally determined.	2.265201853330524
Based on data from uncontrolled and controlled fluid intake studies in the literature and physiological conditions of urinary excretion, the meaningfulness of creatinine concentration in randomly obtained urine samples is discussed.	1.9479269534729435
A low creatinine concentration not clearly proving an intentional dilution of the sample, the application of GC/MS analysis or the concentration of the urine prior to drug screening is recommended for specimens exhibiting a "suspect" urinary creatinine concentration.	1.9925721824982496
Goal: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has a key role within the neuromonitoring, although ICP does not monitor processes of the central neuron directly and only with delay.	1.9882153063851653
One of the important factors in ICP monitoring is measurement accuracy.	2.2093962735307597
For a better understanding of ICP probes and their differences, the function and principles of intracranial pressure transducers should be evaluated from a technical point of view.	2.087821662470331
The therapy for spontaneous or artificial perforation of the esophagus remains a controversial matter.	2.2839179233564044
The following case report deals with the medical history of an artificial esophageal perforation after operative treatment of cervical disc disease.	2.2693200889902285
A 68-year-old male patient underwent a C4/C5 and C5/C6 discectomy with interbody fusion of C7-T1 vertebral body, according to Smith-Robinson.	1.8899036796902118
During this operation, a 3-cm-long lesion was made in the posterior wall of the esophagus, which was treated 24 h later with a primary suture.	2.521905176018408
The clinical follow-up was complicated by mediastinitis with subsequent multiorgan failure.	2.395900946748386
After recovery from this critical condition the patient complained of severe dysphagia, which was related to a persistent lesion in the posterior esophageal wall with endoscopically demonstrated dislocation of a screw.	2.1646145360470586
After removal of the screw, the lesion was covered by means of sternocleidomastoid myoplasty.	2.7766327809043485
Moderate postoperative dysphagia was successfully treated by bougienage.	2.542188588875638
Introduction: The loss of functional capacity by peripheral nerve lesion is easy to be estimated: A certain neurologic dysfunction results in a characteristic reduction of the former individual capacity.	2.2582893882733446
In contrast, the effect of accompanying pain to every-day life and working ability is not known exactly.	2.186244009584747
In this study, we compared the results of judgement in nerve lesions under the circumstances of additional pain syndromes.	2.289291020688143
The guidelines of the International Union against Cancer are generally used to assess malignancy of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.	2.4076488664149363
Beside TNM-staging, histological grading is performed.	2.3237701652119664
An increased malignancy was found in carcinomas with the following features: clinical diameter greater than 2 cm, low degree of keratinization, high degree of cellular polymorphism, high mitotic index and high tumor thickness index (metastases only from tumor thickness 2,4 mm and subcutaneous infiltration), desmoplasia and ulceration.	1.8423629744995664
Consideration of histological tumor parameters improved prognosis assessment.	2.2678744478966517
Multivariate analyses with large case series are necessary to determine ranks of the prognostic factors.	2.207050201372957
Therefore, the data analysis of all centers that contribute to the carcinoma registry will make a precise difinition of high- and low-risk carcinomas possible and can thus influence therapy and follow-up procedures.	2.3180827036619718
Surgical closure of atrial septal defects can nowadays be performed without preoperative cardiac catheterization.	2.0983665234808364
For a transcatheter closure, however, x-ray exposure has been indispensable.	2.695576153401765
We report a closure of an atrial septal defect under transesophageal echocardiography without fluoroscopy.	2.0021946850872325
In field research, training intensity was tested during three different dances by recording the exercise heart rates.	1.9515551259989876
The subjects (twelve women from 59 to 77 years old) were tested once a week three times, over three minutes with a break of three minutes, three weeks in all.	1.8467088250267167
The sequence of the dances changed every week.	2.304144463927474
Measurement of baroreflex sensitivity is a new method to identify patients after myocardial infarction with a high risk for sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.	2.487199226844969
In this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a FINAPRES-device and correlating this with the R-R intervals of the ECG after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of Norfenefrinhydrochlorid (Novadral).	1.8276136384455375
According to other investigators a correlation of >0.7 with a significance of p<0.05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity <3 ms/mm Hg being judged as decreased.	1.7924577731551319
We investigated 302 patients (mean age 59 +/- 17 years, 224 males, 78 females).	2.0878845630848364
In 77 cases (25%) reasonable results could not be achieved.	2.5609297782799914
We found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in 18 investigations (6% of all investigations).	2.137342968349471
41 (13.1%) of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason.	2.0873417533217795
When we looked closely at these nonevaluable results, we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%), diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group.	2.397022559175493
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina.	2.1095971347621343
Only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix, where they are most commonly seen in adolescence.	2.522898409184209
Their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.	3.006783147514359
We report a case of cervical embryonal rhabdomysarcoma in IRS stage Ia in a 32-year-old female.	2.0648104810576102
After surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months.	2.5131013644192244
The case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features, and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed.	2.3890938359803484
Between 1987 and 1993, 41 grade 3B open tibial shaft fractures were treated with the unreamed tibial nail (URTN n = 22) or an external fixator (FIX n = 19).	2.0440493486840587
The method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon.	2.640156311877922
Three below the knee amputations were performed, three patients died, and three were lost to follow-up.	2.2664618817371123
In all, 32 patients were followed up to union or at least for 1 year.	2.4657448057078377
There were no significant statistical differences between the two groups (P<0.2, chi-squared, t-test) with respect to fracture type, fracture location, age, gender or accompanying injuries.	2.16839968331411
The URTN group showed significantly better results regarding time to full weight-bearing (URTN 11 +/- 4 weeks; FIX 20 +/- 11 weeks, P<0.01 M-W) Mann-Whitney Test, number of reoperations (URTN 1.04; FIX 2.89; P<0.01 M-W), isolated bone grafting (URTN 3/22; FIX 8/19; P<0.05 chi-squared), and average Karlström and Olerud score (URTN 30 +/- 4; FIX 26 +/- 5; P<0.05 M-W).	1.9149362382461814
In all, 15/17 URTN patients and only 6/15 FIX patients achieved unlimited walking distance (P<0.01 M-W).	1.8658285720976293
Time to bony union, infection, and nonunion were not significantly different between groups.	2.1821705769373194
By varying the light spectrum, impulse length, impulse sequences and fluences, the PhotoDermVL allows a large choice of individual treatment parameters.	1.8587479194202243
Superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations (essential telangiectases, port-wine stains, Poikiloderma of Civatte, hemangiomatous malformations) and cosmetically bothering hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity polychromatic pulsed light source.	1.9015404818286366
Catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.	2.3307566337319185
However, the risks of catheter ablation have to bee weight against antiarrhythmic therapy.	2.120299517206843
With catheter ablation AV-block III °, pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade (in some cases followed by death), arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described.	2.2820433855780973
Especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients.	2.3382130363159446
On the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown.	2.7370701145981204
The risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after mayocardial infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease.	2.129196038237484
It is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.	2.6581903400117626
Background: Chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea.	2.3454442378543408
The appearance of corneal changes does not seem to be related to dose and duration of treatment.	2.4463201677488735
Dermatological rehabilitation treatment can take different forms: climato-therapy, baths, phototherapy and psychosomatic treatments.	1.966527072040532
Which of these treatments is of most benefit to any one patient depends on his or her illness.	2.1475442224382033
Accordingly, a psychosomatic approach to dermatological illness is indicated mainly when a psychological disorder and a dermatological disease coincide.	1.8755113111248245
In addtion, dermatoses with psychological triggers or overlays, and also depression, pre-existing emotional disorders and special motivation for psychotherapy should be considered for psychosomatic treatment.	2.138269371139056
Finally, patients who are having trouble accepting or confronting malignant skin tumours may also benefit.	2.069516188901118
We report about the possibility of electrophysiological diagnosis and therapy in the treatment of a symptomatic left ventricular tachycardia which could not be treated effectively by oral medical therapy in a 10 year old boy with no obvious structural heart disease.	2.578393825777307
By right bundle-bloc-like QRS-complexes in the surface-ECG, the diagnosis of the ventricular origin of the tachycardia was confirmed by transesophageal-ECG.	2.3518434837465714
This was followed by the first electrophysiological examination that showed increased leftventricular vulnerability.	2.36548089977729
During this electrophysiological examination the tachycardia was terminated by stimulated singular premature beats.	1.9985559237892607
An oral medical therapy with sotalol was started.	2.369515130132045
After the phase of saturation the next ventricular stimulation was done, that showed no sufficient protection of sotalol against VT.	1.9743263440053995
So the decision was made for ventricular ablation.	2.3524872773236916
Since this intervention the patient lives without symptoms.	2.2864710155505974
The pedicles are loaded by uniplanar bending that is reflected by the arrangement of the Corticalis.	1.9507541260910783
The ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and (with exception of the lig.	2.366533652901508
longitudinale anterius) horizontal/oblique segmental ligament bundles.	2.11790568301358
In combination with the anulus fibrosus, the ligaments work as a kind of gear system.	2.121751208512659
They regulate the process of movements of adjactent vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion.	2.119708707444925
Besides maintaining the necessary amount of pretension the intervertebral disc distributes the loads uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies.	1.8671008546523
The intervertebral joints are important for guided motion, by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions.	1.9939240922982235
Because of their position, they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes.	2.0740309401619017
The integrity of the fascia thoracolumbalis warrants the protective function of the autochthonuos muscles.	2.2990216302109134
Prolonged immobilization or physical inactivity has been shown to produce increased bone resorption due to enhanced osteoclastic activity and diminished bone formation.	2.006444390897233
These skeletal changes are a typical complication in tetraplegic patients, who are at risk of developing hypocalcemia.	2.441285103755861
Hypercalciuria is the most characteristic symptom.	3.2273137333910404
Risk factors for development of malignant melanoma have been investigated in several case control studies during the last decade, with some variation in results, partly with geographical region.	2.1353659962760863
Four studies have been conducted under the auspices of the Central Malignant Melanoma Registry of the German Dermatological Society; these have yielded consistent results allowing the identification of risk factors for melanoma development.	2.027086928965556
The numbers of common melanocytic naevi, of atypical melanocytic naevi and the frequency of actinic lentigines were found by multivariate regression analysis to be the most important independent risk factors for melanoma development.	2.3577366910912727
Additional factors were hair colour, skin type and a history of naevus growth.	2.2610689132848725
A classification of relative risks was established by considering the first three risk factors mentioned, without any clear improvement of classification when further additional significant factors were taken into accout.	1.9285041729543502
For example, in individuals with more than 50 common melanocytic naevi, 5 or more atypical melanocytic naevi and simultaneous presence of actinic lentigines the risk of developing melanoma was found to be 100-fold that in persons with 10 common melanocytic naevi or fewer and without atypical melanocytic naevi or actinic lentigines.	2.0871715317008013
Early recognition of melanomas may be substantially improved if these risk factors are considered.	2.145401242056442
Furthermore, intermittent intensive sun exposure (sunburns as indicator) before the age of 20 induces the development of melanocytic naevi, and after the age of 20 it contributes to the development of actinic lentigines; both factors are associated with an increased risk of melanoma development.	2.526154505833019
Method: Children born between 1.	2.5782474682399426
1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound.	2.748998481548353
The data were analysed by SPSS/PC.	2.2873086277549306
Results: 5069 children with 10 138 hips were examined.	2.2257177486747537
85 % were mature (type I), 14 % were physiologically immature (type IIa) and 1.2 % were pathological (IIc, D, IIIa).	1.8182273822191874
A screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors (positive family history or breech position) would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time.	2.004435906236206
The interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) structures of the coronary tree and the myocardium by a clinician demands a subjective visual integration of two-dimensional (2D) images of cardiac diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy.	2.0882426021581573
Although in the conventional analysis of 2D display scintigraphic myocardial perfusion segments are arbitrarily assigned to three major coronary artery systems, the standard myocardial perfusion distribution territories correspond with the individual pathologic-anatomic coronary tree in only 50-60% of the patients.	1.8900717972219239
Hence, the mental integration ob both 2D images of coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy does not necessarily allow an accurate assignment of particular myocardial perfusion regions to the corresponding vessels.	1.862059396250126
Cause-and-effect relationships may be more obvious with 3D data fusion and may enable an easier comparison of anatomy and physiology.	1.9772594244947037
The physician's duty of professional discretion is one of the basic tenets at the heart of the doctor's profession.	2.273966406104309
It is laid down in the physicians' professional code and determined ultimately by the patient's right to self-determination, which is regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	2.1125883834221604
It is established in the ordinance governing physicians' work and has its origin in the patient's right of self-determination.	2.2566045867711013
It is also regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	2.166850522417976
An exception can be made to the duty of professional secrecy if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law.	1.9813843331158287
Some such exceptions are also specified in the German Social Code, although the physician's duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated, particularly when medical data in the strictest sense of the phrase are concerned.	1.9515425236634718
Borderline cases are described to illustrate how the rules of professional medical discretion are breached in the course of day-to-day business transacted between the statutory accident insurance firms and the physicians under contract to them, and some hints are given on how this can be avoided.	1.9639142137383003
We report on a 56-year-old renal allograft recipient receiving cyclosporin A immunosuppression.	1.9772601991305006
During this therapy he subsequently developed the following cutaneous neoplasms: squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis, sebaceous hyperplasia, a dysplastic naevus and, finally a nodular malignant melanoma.	1.8367130772748412
Adverse effects of the cyclosporin A therapy are discussed, with special reference to dermatologic effects and the implications for patient and doctor.	2.3545946887614084
With Multislice Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT), existing indications for performing CT of the chest are strengthened and new applications are emerging.	1.9657433773401591
The high speed of MSCT improves efficiency, image quality and patient comfort of "routine"- imaging of the chest.	2.1767294931577092
The ability to cover large volumes with thin slices improves the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules and allows for high-quality secondary reconstruction.	2.147050713507986
If a comprehensive diagnosis of the mediastinal structures and the pulmonary parenchyma is desired, MSCT for the first time allows reconstruction of contiguous and high- resolution (HRCT) sections from the same set of thin-collimation raw data.	2.105300040029139
This way, contiguous chest images of superior and HRCT sections of equal image quality compared to conventional CT scanning can be obtained.	1.9943428778678802
Vascular protocols greatly benefit from the high speed of MSCT: For imaging the thoracic aorta or pulmonary emboli (PE), the amount of contrast material can be substantially reduced.	2.33587482227983
Owing to thin collimation, the detection-rate of small peripheral emboli can be significantly increased.	2.127243854226054
If indicated, the entire subphrenic venous system can be evaluated during the same session, without additional contrast material.	2.1747671820932193
Abstract   Basis of the modern shoulder implants is the Neer II-system, a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with conforming radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation.	1.989657099715489
The second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the Neer II prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head- and shaft-sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation-translation-mechanism.	2.000800652948519
The third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the eccentric offset of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation.	1.9817583662977067
The latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3-dimensional modularity to independently adjust the prosthestic head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry.	1.9448931504192954
This achieves a 3-dimensional adaptability of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane.	2.367099437147884
Besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established - the replacement of the humeral head articular surface.	2.3002858122762317
A hemispheric surface prosthesis - cup arthroplasty - is cemented onto the residual humeral head, which eliminates the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal.	1.7502120662707854
Bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi-rotational head system.	2.10566371103583
Their indication is limited to pre-existing lesions of the rotator cuff and/or the glenoid surface.	2.839213638289787
The inverse total shoulder prosthesis reverses the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid.	2.390434650597421
The hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component.	1.9825720976525187
This implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences.	2.519535052292379
The role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration.	2.0482491083348293
A fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus, the centre of rotation, and the anatomical retroversion.	2.6359104661124984
Positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process.	1.9793657832454734
A failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result.	2.439808439966698
The shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented, cementless or hybrid techniques.	2.014800484901624
Today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist.	2.090989831093131
The peg-shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear-forces.	1.9109578636842715
Cementless glenoid components consist of a polyethylen inlay and a surface treated metal-back with an integrated fixation system.	1.9371213121897988
These fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self-cutting cage-screw-systems.	1.8847986665328738
The critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the PE-inlay and the metal-back because of high force development.	1.9213383213167008
The question of implanting a hemi- or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface, which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease, and the age of the patient.	2.5384750662914635
Preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work-up - X-ray, CT or MRI - to accurately assess the glenoid morphology.	2.3404777860217796
G. Walch categorised the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations.	2.0227996056723665
Looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are related to the type of prosthesis and the preoperative diagnosis.	2.7863702226752145
The Neer total shoulder prosthesis has a 15 year survival rate of 87 %, compared to 74 % of the hemi-prosthesis.	2.2300094022401162
The objective for the future has to be to further advance the development of prosthetic components, especially for primary joint replacement in acute humeral head fractures.	2.4926758628191936
Another point of interest is how to reduce the still existing high loosening rates of the glenoid components.	2.2647860955235157
The computer-assisted navigation could be of great advantage to accurately find the individual resection plane (inclination and restroversion) of the humeral head.	2.224270687374862
The use of a surgery-robot could be very helpful to reproducibly achieve the desired conformity of the articular surface when preparing the glenoid.	1.949890702230152
Two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on.	2.287601018161793
One case is well documented.	2.7761983849652854
In both cases there was very good functional adaptation, resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement.	2.055512435736352
The rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage.	2.1452715577548993
The function of the supraspinous muscle is also discussed.	2.3852978448766025
Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792-1847) is generally known as the founder of modern plastic surgery.	1.9864127338350146
One focus of his work, apart from the physiology of transplantation and operative techniques, was reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery.	2.042497031869573
This special aspect of plastic surgery as well as Dieffenbach's biography is presented in this historic article.	2.4930923559542433
When a lifeless person is found in a bath tub, the emergency physician is obliged to give medical assistance.	2.1250416563129213
If the patient is dead on arrival, the manner of death will in most cases unsettled.	2.2931336644501856
In these cases the physician should inform the police immediately.	2.1975439927418092
Any alteration of the scene of death should be avoided.	2.6407233979951488
The purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic-endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer.	1.8731359535058894
These procedures were applied to 29 patients.	2.6473609703128136
Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion-lifting method, by which a wedge resection is made while pulling up the full-thickness gastric wall, was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and greater curvature of the stomach.	2.1929043678202826
On pathological examination of resected specimens, the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients.	2.0446017038227398
The histological depth of the lesions was m (mucosal cancer) in 15 patients and sm1 (slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer) in one.	1.9669749380099117
This one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found.	2.30457174068484
Oral nutrition was resumed for a mean ( +/-  SD) of 2.9  +/-  0.8 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.3  +/-  3.4 days.	2.321603645931332
The 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection.	2.324105463926833
Laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage.	2.8383023922127846
The surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful.	2.1609779547469934
Lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2, both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region, total gastrectomy was avoided, and careful observation is continued.	2.116492680153167
Oral nutrition was resumed 4.0  +/-  1.6 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.0  +/-  3.5 days.	2.271558688067517
In addition, no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure, and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow-up period of 460 months.	2.2268018323354246
Selected properly, these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer.	2.1029594321036793
Between 1988 and 1997, tumor resection was carried out in 18 irradiated patients (group 1: 36-72 Gy, 83 implants) and 22 nonirradiated patients (group 2: 92 implants) in the mandible and floor of the mouth, and these patients subsequently underwent mandibular endosseous implant rehabilitation.	2.1116064459618413
A total of 23 patients were treated with exclusively implant-supported prostheses, and 16 with implant tissue-supported constructions.	2.3451276488035266
Between 1988 and 1991, group 1 and 2 patients received implant tissue-supported prostheses (using two to four implants).	2.235408587980738
Due to prosthesis-related pressure lesions, the strategy has now been changed.	2.126175702303225
Special criteria for the success of implant-supported maxillofacial prosthetics were drawn up.	2.612833687261301
With an average follow-up period of 37 months, 160 fixtures (91%) were clinically osseointegrated.	2.2737508748691284
Both types of restoration provided sufficient oral rehabilitation.	2.1729128203742967
However, only completely implant-supported prostheses avoided soft tissue ulcers.	2.1618359116853667
The overall success rate was about 77% after 7 years in group 1 and about 87% after 9 years in group 2.	2.1864674455897353
With regard to implants placed after strategy change, the 5-year success rate was approximately 86% (group 1) and 94% (group 2).	2.1784337952329373
In irradiated patients, an exclusively implant-supported prosthesis without any mucosal contact (thus avoiding soft tissue ulcers with a potential to develop osteoradionecrosis) should therefore be fabricated.	1.957905452233238
Implant tissue-supported restoration is also possible in nonirradiated oral cancer patients.	2.316481767978547
Extracorporal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment.	2.186979547550105
We have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method.	2.594935704997787
In a prospective nonrandomized study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of 6 months.	2.221358472643858
Following 2 cycles of ESWT with 2000 impulses/18 kV, the reevaluation was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.	2.141954044745682
A total of 27 pseudarthroses was reevaluated, in 11 one or more reosteosyntheses had been performed prior to ESWT.	2.0654806671470474
Following ESWT we found a success rate of 41 % (n = 11).	2.5506956607325075
The clinical evidence of subjective, clinical improvement was found in 5 of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within a period of 3 months.	2.515397768642369
Radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within 6 months.	2.342064543880457
ESWT appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion.	2.838299196742194
If no improvement occurs, the maximum delay of reosteosynthesis is three months.	2.0507939710449596
Over a period of 11 years a total of 140 liver resections for non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine hepatic metastases were performed in 127 patients (73 women, 54 men; median age 53 years).	2.198034537405411
Primary tumors were: breast cancer (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic cancer (n = 16), renal cell carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric cancer (n = 9), lung cancer (n = 6) and adrenal cancer (n = 6) and miscellaneous tumors (n = 14).	2.2236906523615305
Extrahepatic tumor manifestation (including synchronous primary tumors) was found in 69/140 cases (49 %); 61 of 120 patients with a first liver resection had extrahepatic tumor (51 %).	2.1876649688749947
Median survival after first liver resection was 20 months; after R0 resection a median survival of 28 months and after R1/2 resection of 8 months was achieved.	2.075867306097571
The 5-year survival rate was 16 % for the total group, 24 % in patients with R0 resection and 0 % for R1/2 resections.	2.30079207229044
After a second liver resection (n = 14) there was a median survival of 28 months (5-year-survival-rate of 21 %) for all patients and of 41 months (5-year survival rate 38 %) after R0 resection.	2.377539770521865
Morbidity and mortality after the first liver resection were 32.5 % and 5.8 %, respectively.	2.220779869679604
In patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the first liver resection a median survival of 32 months (5-year survival rate 25 %) and 7 months was achieved after R0 resection and R1/2 resection, respectively.	2.2365278983661776
In case of extrahepatic tumor the median survival was 24 months (5-year survival rate 23 %) for R0 resection compared to 8 months after R1/2 resection.	2.0602774534236636
These data suggest that not the presence of extrahepatic tumor but rather the possibility of a R0 resection is most decisive for the prognosis after liver resection.	2.3932035601397126
We conclude that patients with liver metastases of non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine tumors may benefit from liver resection.	2.3773717515302732
Similar to colorectal metastases, a second or third liver resection can be worthwhile in selected cases.	1.9747012794560768
Therefore, the indication for liver resection should be considered carefully in every single case.	2.3636906087446743
Generalizations about the outcomes of psychotherapy are essentially based on research on brief therapies with quite short follow-up.	2.0172482863842083
The present paper is a survey of some of the findings in an effectiveness study of psychoanalysis and long-term psychotherapy, typically psychoanalytically oriented, in private practice.	2.342361617622929
The design was a three-wave panel comprising more than 700 patients.	2.207571081296519
At the end of the third wave, 418 patients in different phases of treatment remained in the sample.	2.073596977892549
Across a reconstructed time scale covering roughly seven years, before, during, and after treatment, the 74 psychoanalysis cases described a very positive development, whereas the development among the 331 psychotherapy cases was moderately positive.	2.0191784631741228
The findings emphasize the importance of extended follow-up.	2.709665089227946
When therapist variables are considered, therapeutic experience had complex or mixed associations with patients outcome.	1.9649355621666746
Especially positive were high age and many years, in private practice, after licensing.	2.230400085928474
Therapeutic ideals and attitudes divided the therapist group in three subgroups, one of which was characterized by purely classical psychoanalytic views on the values of support, friendliness etc.	1.8998976772408651
Therapists in the classically psychoanalytic cluster were found to do poorly with patients in psychotherapy, in contrast to patients in psychoanalysis.	2.287030041552076
It is concluded that psychoanalysis and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy are qualitatively different.	2.0200901201187773
Experimental studies and open clinical trials have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as a potentially effective treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).	2.17887498642733
The Austrian Immunoglobulin in Multiple Sclerosis (AIMS) study tested this assumption by examining 148 patients with relapsing-remitting MS in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled fashion (75 IVIg, 73 placebo).	1.7550898421800976
Monthly administration of IVIg in a dosage of 0.15-0.20 g/kg over a period of 2 years slowed the progression of or even reversed disability as evident in a total of 24% of patients and almost halved the number of relapses in comparison to placebo treatment.	2.301387394410937
Therapeutic efficacy was noted within the first 6 months of treatment and was not correlated to the severity of disability (mild neurological sins without disability to ambulatory with assistance) at study entry.	2.1955567161306844
Overall the magnitude of treatment effects of IVIg was comparable to that reported for beta-interferon and copolymer 1.	2.141909337711237
Further ongoing studies will have to clarify the future role of IVIg in the treatment of MS, in particular in the progressive forms of the disease.	2.444001599342816
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of ischemic heart disease.	2.6462091220359465
Incidence, etiology and optimal treatment are ill-defined.	2.3866492512389956
Between July 1995 and December 1997, we prospectively identified 42 patients (36 men, six women, mean age 59 +/- 12 years) with spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 3803 consecutive angiographic examinations in which the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was established for the first time (incidence 1.1%).	2.252065387846649
In comparison to the remaining study population with stable angina pectoris (8 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 2852 patients; incidence: 0.3%), the incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was significantly higher in the patient subgroups with acute myocardial infarction (13/450; 2.9%) and with unstable angina pectoris or postinfarction angina (21/501; 4.2%).	2.140992827884731
Dissection was most frequently located in the left anterior descending coronary artery (19 cases), followed by the right coronary artery (15 cases) and the left circumflex coronary artery (8 cases).	2.730988970342697
Because of an ambiguous angiographic lesion appearance intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in 13 patients to confirm the diagnosis.	2.2548233631667944
In two cases, no obvious risk factor could be identified.	2.2721833551743926
Therapy consisted of intracoronary stenting in 24 patients (including ten patients with acute myocardial infarction), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 8 patients and balloon angioplasty (PTCA) in seven patients.	2.3308687159454906
Three patients were treated conservatively.	3.2763106772634965
Introduction: Since the introduction of laparoscopic hernioplasty the TAPP procedure (transabdominal preperitoneal approach) has become the most widely used technique.	2.3075749761956885
Many surgeons have changed to the total extraperitoneal approach (TEP), because they fear the consequences of a peritoneal lesion.	2.0948972968731177
Method: We evaluated our results with TAPP in a retrospective study, with special attention to complications caused by the approach.	2.5539934515158325
We operated on 460 hernias in 390 patients in a period of 5 years.	2.3524761081880605
Results: Complication rates and recurrence rates were similar to those after TEP.	2.4660063712008955
There was a marked learning curve with decrease of both rates during the evaluated years.	1.9809554812069987
There were no complications related to the transabdominal approach other than trocar hernias, the rate of which could be reduced by eliminating the learning curve and by using smaller trocar diameter.	2.185455322725869
Conclusion: We see no reason to change from TAPP to the TEP technique.	2.055076251180124
This article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines, automatic teller machines (ATMs) and telephone cards by the elderly in four European regions.	1.8438291893277226
The analyses are based on data from an international project entitled "Keeping the Elderly Mobile", collected in Mannheim (former West Germany; N=404 home-dwelling respondents), Chemnitz (former East Germany; N=400), Ancona (Italy; N=600), and Jyväskylä (Finland; N=618).	1.746179861190701
The random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country.	2.1124735844979208
Two generations of men and women (aged 55-74 and 75+ years, respectively) participated in the study.	2.1420803642181863
Results show that respondents generally made little use of the three technologies under investigation: in fact, the majority of respondents does not use them at all.	2.3132464802978614
The most frequently used devices were ATMs in Chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in Mannheim.	1.8554226449775133
On the basis of logistic regression analysis, age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions, i.e., the users were mostly the "young-old."	2.2234740883587474
Education was a more important variable than gender.	2.5351403871280347
In all four regions, the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier; nevertheless, ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in Mannheim.	1.8334719008863036
Interesting differences and similarities among the towns were also found.	2.23747922758303
The present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth.	1.8445943333052777
All patients were pharmacologically treated with the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin.	2.2016263462888643
The verum group (n=22) received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression.	2.723944846986164
The placebo group (n=24) was treated with acupuncture at non-specific locations and the control group (n=24) received only pharmacological treatment.	2.4845377936506923
Acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks.	2.531138417029724
Additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself.	2.247750840174898
However, we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture.	2.1441400684375442
Acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure, acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.	2.2165037143875908
While decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated.	2.097519522893363
Cardiogenic shock, however is still a therapeutic challenge.	2.5912845307526746
For therapy of cardiogenic shock positive inotropes, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use.	1.9901493202217007
If it is not possible to correct underlying diseases, mortality of cardiogenic shock is still high.	2.5559787886848846
Two years after the diagnosis of Sézary syndrome, a 50-year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet, leading to acral necrosis.	2.521818614041203
Another 59-year old patient presented with severe pain in his feet, secondary to ischemia.	2.6425134512722583
This was the first symptom of a T-cell-chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	2.489265428523369
Similar cases have only occasionally been described.	2.51025509682283
The relationship between acral ischemia and T-cell-lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article.	2.368638569657757
The clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in combina-tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast- enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma.	1.9086967784893032
We report our findings in a 57-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma.	2.2504622849287133
A large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits.	2.024127917811801
Both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate manifestationes of a lymphoma.	2.011988626387962
The development of a progressive facial palsy within 8 weeks of presentation and an atypi-cal occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma.	1.952974963467741
Such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car-dinal symptoms require further diagnostic measures.	2.1699822097637194
Manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare.	2.4963216732972557
To our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome has never been reported before.	2.4905513028448474
Cutaneous blisters on a corpse are not only of forensic interest regarding their etiology and genesis but also the time of origin, particularly the problem of vital, agonal, supravital or postmortem occurrence of cutaneous blisters could be of forensic value.	2.0292457854414923
The aim of this work was to summarize the causative spectrum of cutaneous blisters, including poisonous plants and animals, drugs and toxic substances.	1.897096542799691
The purpose of the present study was to compare two sedation regimens with either propofol (P) or methohexital (M) for elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with respect to safety, side effects, recovery, and discharge time.	2.283658467182963
Pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion.	2.3912376349016196
Nevertheless, thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications.	2.442890530710639
The most frequent complication is hemorrhage.	2.287943787952875
Of these, the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare, but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications, and they have an extremely poor prognosis.	2.004565115004209
Within 58 months 361 patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas.	2.448302534485802
In 22 patients (6.1%) the hematoma developed as a complication of systemic thrombolysis.	2.319113650470364
Two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery.	3.095340360710381
One patient died: the other survived but was severely disabled.	2.1476031246656206
The latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned.	2.100113546940694
These worrying examples stress the necessity for careful evaluation of risk factors and the natural history of the underlying disease for which systemic thrombolysis is indicated.	2.304557340478594
Local selective (or superselective) thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure, provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications.	2.0034470048956026
We report on a 61-year-old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease.	2.059642765429631
The congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of (post-endocarditic) insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life.	2.443310116063951
It was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization.	2.5254848034163206
The physiopathology of quadricuspid aortic valve will be discussed.	2.2820717939209523
Due to its high prevalence, atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice.	2.5718528947173613
The chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system.	2.0881267887333896
We describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our Department of Dermatology.	2.2042228084388724
A high degree of standardization is combined with a high measure of individual care.	2.6685894520504903
The aims of this clinic are an optimized outpatient management of atopic dermatitis, the gathering of epidemiologic data, the performance of controlled studies, and potentially the reduction of costs.	2.083564578757116
Abstract:  Traumatic cerebral aneurysms are rare in severely head-injured patients.	2.249870144528499
We present the first case of a traumatic aneurysm of the A1/A2 junction.	2.5196552926662736
Purpose: Although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago, the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear.	2.0349741450703567
Recent OCT studies have shown schisislike spaces in connection with the disc.	2.5835988956754607
None of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven.	2.20421259353924
Besides the hypothesis of exudation, the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion.	2.2465986085248018
We describe a case of macular detachment associated with optic pit that regained full vision after pars plana vitrectomy with laser coagulation and gas tamponade over a follow-up of 26 months.	1.9409515927636924
The purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits.	2.2705780711222143
Sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion, which was not recognized until a few years ago.	2.5371031033882208
As in sclerosing adenosis of the breast, a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate.	2.1305425355983827
An incidence of 2.8 % was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands.	2.0443026655005174
As demonstrated in this case report, the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	2.5646499666963667
Histological diagnosis of sclerosing adenosis based on routine HE sections is supplemented by immunohistochemical methods.	1.98905799000895
Important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation, which is demonstrated by cytokeratin 903, and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation, with expression of S-100 and/or smooth muscle actin.	2.4904152638179493
These antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	2.523832163855722
Nevertheless, in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible, even after the application of immunohistochemical methods.	2.5835641742963884
Further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	1.9714326042955197
So far, there appears to be no evidence of a direct relationship between sclerosing adenosis of the prostate and an elevated risk of carcinoma.	2.511820503988384
Benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to "malignant" complications, so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance.	2.118992039530845
Our investigation summarizes a 10-year experience after surgical treatment of 29 patients suffering from benign intracavitary cardiac tumors.	2.4892520392411694
The postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in 27 cases; in 2 cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed.	2.140172337047175
The main symptom in 19 patients was dyspnea.	2.5142792369105815
In 8 cases an embolic event occurred.	2.3412894887949407
All patients underwent extirpation of the tumor.	2.535945373990646
Early mortality was 10 %, while late mortality was 4 %.	2.327226703233625
The treatment of choice of benign intracavitary cardiac tumors is extirpation, which, due to unpredictable embolic complications, is to be carried out immediately should the tumor have a lobulated tuberous surface.	2.280455350162892
In such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance.	2.0453191978100445
We present a case of a 48 year old man who complained of progressive dyspnoe.	2.5694594986716215
Radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung.	3.290589762494923
Biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium polymorph tumor cells admixed with some histiocytes.	2.0741249971661695
Malignant melanoma of the bronchus was included in the differential diagnosis.	2.4375547240676485
A thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed.	2.4307463091912997
The lung is an uncommon localisation of angiomyolipoma with so far three reported cases.	2.1534691530805814
Lipoma, leiomyoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis have to be included in the differential diagnosis.	2.5492824655573343
The peculiarity of this case is the presence of multiple pigmented tumor cells that express HMB-45.	2.400339029464115
This has not been reported yet.	2.9263622003214076
Background: The maximum number of cell divisions of a certain cell population is genetically fixed so that aging cells become non-dividing (senescent) at least.	1.8390740913131427
This replicative life span, also known as "hayflick limit", is probably defined by a "critical" length of the telomeres.	2.1308887000924557
Telomeres are special DNA-sequences located at the four ends of the chromosomes which are shortened with each cell cycle.	2.0044698439556874
Cells of most, but not all malignant tumours have been shown to reactivate the enzyme telomerase so that telomeres can be reconstructed, "Hayflick limit" can be overcome, and unlimited cell division can be established.	1.942453600233565
This study was undertaken to elucidate whether telomerase reactivation is used by uveal melanoma cells.	1.955858153521229
Of 59 patients with acute injuries, 52 were painfree with full stability of the MP joint; 23 patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability.	2.191346105683322
Nevertheless, the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired.	2.26584971214491
The results of follow-up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective.	2.3780277033678194
The purpose of this study was to assess the role of spiral computed tomography (SCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative work-up of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, regarding local resectability and vascular involvement.	2.5036528928841824
Methods and materials: A total of 28 patients (19 men and 9 women; mean age 58 years) with known or highly suspected carcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study.	2.4376158541020674
All patients prospectively underwent MRI ( +/-  gadolinium-DTPA) and SCT (3-phase examination) as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies, and laparotomy was carried out within 7 days, irrespective of the MRI or SCT findings.	2.110856998119192
SCT and MR studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, without knowing the results of the surgical exploration.	2.536863501845672
Standardized image analysis was correlated with findings at laparatomy.	2.3219326403709966
Results: Laparotomy identified 10 patients to be suitable for surgical resection and 18 pancreatic carcinomas to be unresectable.	2.2182033347923977
In 17 of 18 non-resectable carcinomas MRI and SCT were able to obtain correct information about unresectability (sensitivity 94 %), in 7 (MRI), resp.	2.0782835557798545
8 (SCT) carcinomas were correctly considered to be resectable (sensitivity 70 % for MRI and 80 % for SCT).	2.13367841834494
The presence of vascular involvement was depicted by SCT with a sensitivity of 82-100 % and 62-100 % by MRI.	1.9985526551771207
The specificity varied between 85-100 % for SCT and 77-100 % for MRI.	2.134381250762816
Conclusion: Both MRI and SCT are good techniques for the preoperative work-up of pancreatic carcinomas in order to obtain a correct assessment of local resectability.	2.476422462159624
Pancreatic pseudocysts occur as a complication in the natural course of acute or chronic pancreatitis, with a spontaneous resolution rate of 40 % to 60 %.	2.4581092454889837
The incidence of pseudocysts in the course of chronic pancreatitis amounts to 60 %.	2.534382299690626
Pseudocysts have to be differentiated from neoplastic or congenital pancreatic cystic lesions.	2.5592591467818986
Careful diagnostic work-up including ERCP and CT scanning is mandatory in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts.	2.239386008689742
The indication for treatment depends on the development of symptoms or complications.	3.053401037226007
Pain is present in up to 90 % of all patients, and the rate of complications varies between 2 % and 55 %.	3.377845356325555
Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually an epiphenomenon of chronic pancreatitis.	2.416249083849778
Pancreatic resection therefore represents a causative treatment.	2.284436808077689
New percutaneous and endoscopic techniques for draining pseudocysts are challenging the previous hegemony of the surgeon.	1.9848076062166768
Therefore, in most symptomatic cases surgery is considered the treatment of choice.	2.5385821348149924
A 28-year-old drug addict who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis (simultaneously: hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection by delta hepatitis).	1.8489638653073548
Liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive microvesicular steatosis, compatible with a delta virus infection.	1.846111359487886
Moderate pulmonary fat embolism (grade I-II according to Falzi) was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages.	2.151150700738038
It is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing hepatocytes may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism; the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.	1.8645181177081844
Suicide on railways (either by being run over by or jumping in front of a train) is one of the 'hardest' suicide methods.	1.9529497149919255
In Austria, 617 suicides or attempted suicides on railways were registered between 1990 and 1994.	1.9189891326645983
This amounts to 5.73 % of all suicides committed in this period with women showing a higher percentage than men.	1.9467357637358278
In both men and women there was a predominance of younger age groups; the mean age was higher in women than in men (48.0 vs 40.4 years).	2.1364673896441424
There was a significant increase in suicides or attempted suicides on railways after a television report on the stress suffered by train drivers concerning possible suicides.	1.8556482967882062
Persuading the mass media to treat the subject of 'suicide' with reserve and with greater caution, even when not presenting a distinct suicide model, may be of importance in general suicide prevention.	2.016961229139641
For decades the results of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) are differently discussed, so that it is not definitely recommended at present the less so since the morbidity of this operation can't be neglected.	2.1885558857129115
Since the beginning of 1995 we practice a gamma-probe guided sentinel lymphonodectomy (SLNE) on patients with melanoma from a Breslow tumor thickness of 1 mm upward, after injecting a colloidal 99m-Tc labelled tin (II) - sulfid solution around the tumor or the scar, if the tumor has been excided before.	1.7529724727903893
By this method, that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage I or II (UICC) but even histopathologically to a stage III and who are profiting of a removal of the regional lymph nodes, the sentinel node can be exactly localised, tissue-sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity.	1.969854846911833
When finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows.	2.5008093817149843
In most cases, a deterioration of subjective well-being due to the consequences of the hip fracture could be prevented; the well-being improved in most cases.	2.609931607519835
When discharged, the subjective well-being of our patients was comparable to the well-being of similar-aged people living at home.	2.556758372662015
Antidepressants are used in demented patients for treating depressive symptoms as well as other non-cognitive symptoms including agitation, aggression and irritability.	2.245556702917734
As patients are usually elderly, a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants.	2.116527575814702
New antidepressants such as the SSRIs and the reversible MAO inhibitors should be the first-line agents in these patients, because their efficacy is not different from that of classic TCA, but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects, ease of use and safety.	2.1435271129508076
Improvement in cognitive performance, however, may not be expected from the new antidepressants.	2.7706494511709314
For the treatment of agitation, aggression and irritabiltiy, antipychotics and benzodiazepines are in frequent use, although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patiens.	1.9150320211351937
Good alternatives are the antidepressant trazodone and citalopram.	2.250965224219057
All medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples, so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously.	2.0619023027176895
The application of laser energy to joint capsular tissues resulted in the reduction of the joint capsule.	2.4752366587161387
Primary clinical results of combined laser-assisted capsular shrinkage (LACS) and multiple suture repair (Caspari) for arthroscopic stabilization procedure of anterior shoulder instability are presented.	1.9390911867682086
From July 1997 to October 1998, 18 patients (2 female, 16 male; mean age 27.9 years; range 16-42 years) with anterior instability and recurrent dislocations of the shoulder received a combined arthroscopic stabilization procedure.	2.0701545943384554
The operative technique involved the use of transglenoid sutures to repair the labrum and shift the capsule (Caspari) and LACS.	2.0156954187747664
Laser energy was applied using a Ho: YAG laser (10 W, 1 J, 10 pulses/s, total energy: 1500-2000 J).	1.8065661027804873
From June 1992 to Februrary 1996, arthroscopic suture stabilization without laser shrinkage was performed on 17 patients (2 female, 15 male; age 25.9 years/range 18-37 years).	1.8603544129445346
The average follow-up in this group was 4.5 years (range 2-5.5 years), and we found 41.2% (7/17) recurrent dislocations.	2.5857434993180686
After combined arthroscopic procedure of multiple suture repair (Caspari) and LACS, a significantly (chi-squared test, P = 0.05) lower recurrence rate was obtained.	2.081123412661457
Only in one patient (5.6%, 1/18) did we find this failure.	2.1770010048070403
No complications occurred in either group.	2.316267165215771
Although, no long-term results are available, the method seems to be suitable for associating low recurrence rates with the advantages of arthroscopic surgery.	2.651042900765515
Simple bone cysts are asymptomatic, benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph.	2.081872962185631
Etiology and treatment are controversially discussed.	2.6179411834112547
We present a case report of an intact unicameral bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma.	2.0465028791259687
Several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested.	2.311231622795087
The question whether treatment is unconditionally necessary is controversially discussed.	2.0675979484949583
It is the author's opinion, that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment.	1.9931510610983594
Facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis.	2.087585409230068
In the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated.	2.383114049399385
Twenty healthy subjects underwent four neuromyographic tests at intervals of one week.	2.1695435248888812
The study group consisted of 12 males and 8 females.	2.2735597209872225
Ages ranged from 23 to 36 years.	2.3330382640655034
The stimulation intensity required for supramaximal stimulation was 14.6 mA on average.	2.0132036255034444
The mean of the intra-individual side-to-side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32.5%.	2.123112334778352
Results of the four repeated tests ranged from no to 80% side-to-side differences in the same individual.	2.3691744767214944
The hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data.	2.0264852720313984
As with previous investigators we found significant side-to-side differences in healthy subjects.	2.2771653829448724
Furthermore, we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements.	2.1081548537313877
We conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography.	2.3520273770448936
To compare patient dose and image quality of electron-beam-CT vs. spiral-CT by means of phantom measurements.	2.2568521493835676
An EBCT scanner (C-150 XP) and a spiral-CT scanner (GE  HiSpeed Advantage) were used to scan three different phantoms.	2.138575554432183
Administered dose, high contrast (HC) resolution, low contrast (LC) lesion detectability and the width of the radiation beams were measured.	1.940426077581099
EBCT showed 25-35% lower HC resolution in comparison to spiral-CT. LC lesion detectability showed equivalent results for S/N vs. patient dose using 3 mm collimation with EBCT and spiral-CT, whereas spiral-CT was superior for 1,5 and 6 mm collimation.	1.982379093610088
Dose measurements revealed a 2 fold higher patient dose using EBCT with 1,5 mm or 6 mm collimation compared to spiral-CT using equivalent scan parameters.	2.0364062218970203
No differences were seen using 3 mm collimation.	2.305739445231271
Differences were due to insufficient beamside collimation of the EBCT.	2.2698155213520126
The use of EBCT with 6 mm collimation should be avoided, because of impaired performance.	2.4646996313811624
In an experimental study, the biomechanical qualities of the combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO) in the unstable Colles' fracture were analyzed.	2.1549743850651986
This type of pin fixation is our preferred osteosynthesis in the treatment of unstable Colles' fracture because it allows immediate functional therapy.	2.2024463650978965
It represents a modification of Kapandji's dynamic KWO, compensating for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static KWO.	2.1030471017265477
Clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results, was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined KWO and its single components should be constituted.	2.414544603163789
Simulation of the unstable Colles' fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material.	2.236539313950053
This fracture model was subsequently pinned using the different KWO types and tested by a standardized vector energy testing device regarding its stability in the four main loading directions.	1.8986456171936654
The combined KWO unifies the advantage of volar stability of the conventional KWO with the high dorsal stability of dynamic KWO.	2.243608763387508
The main functional principle of dynamic KWO with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission.	2.041558969759875
Furthermore, the experiments yielded important information about technical aspects of the surgical procedure, which helps us to avoid anatomical and functional deficiencies.	2.1710207613814916
Based on these experimental findings, the surgical technique of combined KWO was standardized.	2.377587922564878
This is demonstrated by the ongoing improvement and further development of different methods and by the fact that users of these techniques are not always satisfied.	2.4888383340129434
We present the case of a 2-year-old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive scalding of the face.	2.3425670388446087
Because of the morphological findings the medico-legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven.	2.025048227499758
During the criminal proceedings at the appeal court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico-legal expert became obvious.	1.9483470925442137
Findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and pouring of water and the influence of clothing in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment.	2.2279182529668917
The opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be refuted.	2.6534164283959685
During the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an acquittal "in dubio pro reo".	1.9569988475449476
Anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in 163 patients.	2.6811019961372877
Lesions treated were located between T4 and L3, most frequently occuring at T12/L2.	1.9793369479617997
Operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure.	2.145094072026709
2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure.	2.170622759020312
One positioning related pressure harm on the thoracodorsal nerve and one irritation of the L1 root at the entrance site were both transitory.	1.8309294834302388
Postoperative control by X-ray and CTscan showed correct positioning of the bone graft, as well as the fixation device in all patients.	2.737757443795538
Our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method.	2.517232970965946
Major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach, postoperative pain reduction, early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay.	2.235891042038355
In order to restore function and esthetics in mandibular hypoplasia, transplantation of osteochondral grafts and the distraction osteogenesis technique are used alternatively.	1.954105428898573
In a retrospective study the indication, growth and complication rate of osteochondral graft and distraction osteogenesis cases in mandibular hypoplasia were compared.	2.1306472211328495
In total, 12 patients (4-14 years old; 7 female, 5 male) with different grades of mandibular hypoplasia received osteochondral grafts (7 costochondral, 5 iliac crest; observation period 4-9 years).	2.0261854043927845
In 5 patients (10-12 years old; 1 female, 4 male), distraction osteogenesis was performed (observation period 10 months to 3 1/2 years).	2.100330437921486
In the results, according to the literature, the range of growth after osteochondral grafting varied considerably, approximate normal growth was noticed in only two cases.	2.3708451161868567
On the other hand, all patients treated by distraction osteogenesis showed a stable increase of bone length as expected.	2.2085115486544957
After osteochondral grafts, adequate growth is to be expected in the minority of cases and it does not seem predictable in individual cases.	2.292549473738206
Therefore, the indication for osteochondral grafts should be restricted to severe hypoplasia, where the local amount of bone does not allow the use of a distraction device, and to cases where support of the mandibula at the skull base is necessary.	2.2281140195785314
In all other cases of mandibular hypoplasia in children, distraction osteogenesis should be discussed as the primary option, even if in the long term a second surgical procedure should be necesssary.	2.244050629253901
To evaluate the predictive value of MRI in the early postoperative course after cruciate ligament replacement, a prospective study was performed.	2.7372742815684665
Twenty patients with reconstructed anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament were examined clinically and with contrast-enhanced MRI 2, 12, 24 weeks, 1 and 2 years postoperatively.	2.404401550148313
The clinical examinations were evaluated according to the scores by Lysholm, OAK and IKDC.	2.259807338699238
The MRI scans (SP 63, 1.5 Tesla) were evaluated regarding the quality and signal intensity of the reconstructed ligament.	2.147434499760347
During the first postoperative year a significant increase in signal intensity and inhomogeneity of the neoligament in MRI was observed in 16 patients with an average value for signal/noise of 1.1 2 weeks postoperatively up to 6.9 1 year postoperatively.	2.2085471280339206
In 12 patients the reconstructed ligament could not be evaluated in the 1-year postoperative MRI, whereas none of these patients was suspected clinically of having instability.	2.372482328171939
In the 2-year postoperative MRI, the signal intensity of the neoligament was found to be decreasing again with improvement in judgement.	2.3178987925630863
Miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today.	2.807455999994476
The treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent.	2.140380948622311
Titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures.	2.9210018245640463
Compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry.	1.9900228030610783
The titanium mesh can be adapted and screwed individually in any situation, in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates.	2.07164894660678
As a result, complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent.	2.092729505433583
Non-invasive methods to identify absent or persistent myocardial viability have gained increasing importance in the therapeutic management and risk stratification of patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	2.2854312703954855
Myocardial scintigraphy using thallium-201 and positron emission tomography with metabolic imaging of myocardial glucose metabolism, using fluorine-18 fluoro-deoxyglucose, are today the most widely used nuclear methods for the assessment of myocardial viability.	1.9002744199191282
Besides the prediction of reversible regional and global myocardial dysfunction following coronary revascularization, both methods have demonstrated the ability to identify patient subgroups who will benefit most with regard to cardiac prognosis and survival and those patients in whom coronary revascularization has a limited effect with regard to survival and cardiac events.	2.10353694986989
This short review summarizes the clinical impact of both imaging modalities on todays diagnostic approach in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	2.22042990037928
An elderly woman was found dead in her farm house lying in a pool of blood and was partially unclothed.	2.0220439486547703
The investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual murder.	2.598035571487249
The autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis.	2.2852336251002234
The woman has obviously been surprised by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage.	1.791032173780955
A similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described.	2.4628795571126543
In the ankle (talocrural) joint, the lower end of the tibia and fibula embrace the trochlea tali.	2.285118273682299
Thus, an approximately uniaxial joint is formed which permits dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot against the leg.	1.9902135456108951
Due to the geometry of the trochlea tali, conjunct lateral rotation of the fibula against the tibia occurs at the tibiofibular articulations synchronously with active dorsiflexion at the ankle joint.	1.8534971841854642
Movements at the talocrural joints are mainly limited by the opposing muscles as well as by strong collateral ligaments.	2.3676454902715083
Talus and calcaneus form a functional unit connected by posterior and anterior articulations.	2.1132173591539236
The posterior articulation is the subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint; in the anterior articulation, talar facets of the calcaneus together with the posterior surface of the navicular and the superior fibrocartilaginous surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament form a concavity for the talar head.	1.8803765333171665
Thus, the talocalcaneonavicular joint is a compound and - like the subtalar joint - a multiaxial articulation.	2.0332912808384247
On the weight-bearing foot, the distal tarsus and metatarsus are pronated and supinated against the talus in order to maintain plantigrade contact.	2.108721874988457
When the foot is off the ground, these movements are modified to eversion and inversion, also involving the calcaneocuboid joint.	1.8414704590168565
In addition, movements between the calcaneus and cuboid also occur during pronative or supinative changes between the fore- and hindfoot.	1.8591273237033605
Limitation of movements is due to leg muscles as well as strong ligaments.	2.8311146198799553
Finally, the cuneonavicular, cuboideonavicular, intercuneiform and cuneocuboid joints permit some additional alterations of the loaded foot in contact with the ground.	1.8139419583311829
A case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented.	2.0092900276512147
The tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII associated antigen) and express also histiocytic antigens (CD 68, lysozyme, Cathepsin D, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin) as well as CD 8.	1.9007278447655425
This marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with  histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of littoral cells angioma.	2.110056537328812
Despite major advances in knowledge and development of efficient techniques for pain control, many patients on surgical wards suffer from modest to severe pain following surgery or trauma.	1.9653713335507597
Therefore, in the University Hospital of Kiel, Germany, an anaesthesiology-based acute pain service (APS) was started in 1985 to improve this situation.	2.0862620096338493
The anaesthesiologist in training who manages the recovery unit serves as an APS for surgical wards and is supervised by a consultant.	1.9509967396919583
The anaesthesists on call are responsible after regular working hours.	2.1015605038404748
The activities of the APS are as follows: 1.	2.363214288247488
Induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients.	2.359176472310725
Clinical rounds on all patients receiving epidural analgesia (EA), other forms of regional analgesia, or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) every morning and throughout the day if necessary.	1.8513886625622256
Additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request.	2.3310710510986854
Assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient, quality of analgesia, and side effects.	3.2730674487569877
Writing orders for further treatment.	2.7684676615571187
Continuing consultations and informal education for ward nurses, physiotherapists, and surgical staff; formal medical training for ward nurses in postoperative pain management.	1.9844597946442903
From 1985 to 1992, 1947 patients on normal wards were treated (EA: 1736, PCA: 183).	1.8241969918105825
Epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0.175% - 0.25% infused continuously with top-ups if needed (mean 240 mg/day, range 75 - 600 mg; median duration 7 days, range 1 - 53, Table 1).	1.8050548032448175
Demand for further treatment was proved by day-to-day withdrawal.	2.538653706241937
Since the introduction of an APS, complications of EA such as hypotension (1985/1986: 5.1%; 1987/1992: 0.5%, Table 3) and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly (Table 3).	1.9082198453572603
Dermal infections were seen in 2.6% of patients, with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases (4.1%).	3.0304404629751045
Epidural opioids were used in only 46 selected cases on surgical wards.	2.3053108390694352
Nevertheless, 2 cases of marked respiratory depression occurred.	2.3862439380849323
The overall risk of complications during postoperative EA could be reduced from 1 : 11 cases in the first 2 years to 1 : 20 in the last 6 years since introducing the APS.	2.206249874387695
For other regional procedures (e.g., interpleural analgesia) no complications were recorded.	2.200583804134189
PCA was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion (Table 6).	2.0228038202206537
The loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit.	2.4455503790819852
The median duration of PCA was 4 days (range 1 - 23); the median dose of piritramide was 45 mg/day (range 3 - 226 mg).	1.96428619182269
Two cases of somnolence and respiratory depression occurred.	2.211191486142738
In this period there were 8 potential life-threatening complications due to postoperative pain therapy; 4 occurred during standard surgical pain management (3 cases of severe respiratory depression after i.m.	2.064221186681614
piritramide (unsuccessfull resuscitation), tramadol, and buprenorphine; 1 small child with multiorgan failure after paracetamol intoxication).	1.8971291862911321
In those cases the APS was not involved.	2.3750486953265004
There are insufficient data for comparison of the incidence of complications following standard management of postoperative pain relief without an APS, i.e., i.m.	2.529919161510523
injections of opioids on request, but severe and sometimes lethal complications have been reported.	2.1787768782666084
Since the majority of patients used EA or PCA for several days, it is again emphasised that these techniques should not be restricted to high-dependency areas such as intensive care or recovery units.	2.2018321429350864
The introduction of an APS is an adequate approach to more efficient and safer pain management on surgical wards.	1.939748323736418
This requires standard protocols (Table 7), standardised monitoring and trained ward nurses.	2.0138049440970898
Lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally, bilaterally or in combination with other craniosynostoses.	2.327800206523616
Using the concept of fronto-orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis.	2.330770006693686
The process involves striped transversal osteotomy, removal, remodelling and advancement of the occipital region.	1.974150179580926
It allows precise, reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments.	2.2917364584393205
Artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy.	2.6445093668423647
The remodelling leads to a well-proportioned skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume.	2.573282470295499
This article presents the operative method and the results of 14 patients.	2.649918929179283
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neoplasm of neural crest origin.	2.4797197742037165
It almost always occurs in children younger than one year of age with a predilection for the anterior maxillary ridge.	2.0764909205595052
Although it usually follows a benign course, local destruction as well as metastasis and death may result from the tumor.	2.484161940115975
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor is most commonly treated by surgery.	2.340154249177202
10-15% of the lesions recur.	3.0920259202474285
We report the case of a 2-month-old infant suffering from melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy of the premaxilla who was successfully treated with a combination of various chemotherapeutic agents in order to spare the child a mutilating operation or the late effects of radiation.	2.122036221394047
Computer-assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures.	2.1900755350646066
Several reports on clinical results of computer-aided screw insertion in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as well as the sacro-iliac joints are available.	2.225524781926686
They show a significant decrease of screw malplacement rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques.	2.467281931042879
Over the past years, antioxidants, and particularly vitamin E, have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases.	2.318334857162218
In rheumatology, interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.	2.6270369689411472
However, the concept of using antioxidant nutrients as potential remedies is not new.	2.175543896582626
As early as the sixties, first case reports have described beneficial effects of vitamin E in the therapy of osteoarthritis.	2.18677471156297
Nonetheless, most of the following studies were not conducted properly, thus, not allowing valid inferences about the efficacy of vitamin E. Newer studies with sound methodology have shown a beneficial effect in rheumatic diseases, mainly in the reduction of pain.	2.31033501800824
This paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin E in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.	2.311180553284814
Recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management.	2.100555738018851
Unreamed nailing with solid tibial nails is an accepted method of treatment for open tibial shaft fractures up to grade III and of closed tibial fractures with severe soft tissue damage.	2.0498255775855982
However, fatigue failure of the distal locking bolts is a frequent complication.	2.7707491097700747
We report a mechanical study investigating the fatigue limit of six different types of locking bolts used in solid tibial nails (Biorigid Tibial nail/aap, UTN/ace, STN/Howmedica, TLN/Howmedica, R & T Tibial nail/Smith & Nephew, AO/ASIF UTN/Synthes).	1.6298065248320348
Our results prove a direct correlation between the bolt's diameter and mechanical properties.	2.2453524200290795
Further more we found that bolts with a continuing thread were weaker than bolts of the same diameter with only a short thread and an increased diameter at the nail's aperture.	1.9483853617824196
Our results suggest that mobilization with half of the average body weight (350N) allows osseous consolidation without fatigue failure of any of the tested locking bolts.	2.0823555321626315
Some of the tested locking bolts may even withstand full weight-bearing in a physiological walking cycle, but will not withstand the stress of a running cycle.	1.844415826978462
Voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and/or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections.	2.1522280492044183
The urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders, but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction.	2.0518387878044337
In the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed.	2.273613559647669
Behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role.	2.314807063585954
Therapy is based on behavioural modification.	3.0325959712445405
We report on two patients with granulomatous rosacea and another patient with granulomatous perioral dermatitis who responded well to dapsone.	1.932394076537605
Dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug.	2.056406664096506
Before the introduction of isotretinoin, dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne.	2.489819360597183
To date, its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described.	2.455464782651685
When hematologic parameters are monitored, dapsone is considered a safe and cost-effective drug, especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available.	2.3557098128444864
However, the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study.	2.0195896513596328
Anaesthesia both for adenotomy (AT) and for tonsillectomy (TE) frequently presents a challenge.	2.020270035848166
On one hand, children scheduled for adenotomy often have upper airway infections and are thus at risk of laryngo- and bronchospasm; on the other hand the ENT surgeon and the anaesthetist have to share the "workspace" in the patient's mouth.	2.0742579871899505
Since the succinyl choline debate in the early 1990s, the question of the best muscle relaxant has gone hand in hand with that of the most appropriate means of securing the airway.	2.290850168680241
The concept of the laryngeal mask as airway was initially greeted with scepticism.	2.130078608826771
Following several years' use of the mask for this purpose in AT and TE in young children, we report our experience and summarise the literature on this topic.	2.2473957604218056
The laryngeal mask represents a safe alternative to intubation, provided there is close cooperation with the ENT surgeon.	2.21150186720949
Topical corticosteroids (CS) are frequently used to treat of allergic contact dermatitis, so that their own potential for sensitization is rarely detected.	2.2446929705455156
However, increasing numbers of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported during the last 10 years, and allergic skin reactions to over 50 particular compounds have been observed.	2.217048138598283
CS must now be regarded as a rather frequent contact allergen, the prevalence being twice as high in women as in men.	2.1270923318979325
Contact allergy to CS is clinically characterized by a chronic and persistent, corticosteroid-resistant dermatitis.	2.272485374778072
In general, hypersensitivity to CS is a type I and/or type IV mediated allergic reaction.	2.386575779475485
Cross-sensitivity between individual corticosteroid preparations has been described owing to their closely related chemical structures (e.g.	1.9266532444311988
hydrocortisone and tixocortol pivalate).	2.4797176922058384
For routine screening the use of the patient's own material and of tixocortol pivalate and budesonide as test marker substances seems appropriate.	2.241917601585751
The development of further marker substances is a target for ongoing research.	2.045400516733626
The alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process.	2.1765185806279157
The historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts, these being the implicit "standard alliance" of Freud, Zetzel's therapeutic alliance and Greenson's working alliance, are to be described.	2.0642432547654046
All alliance concepts refer to a general, essentially reality-oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain, which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work.	2.0525354354351486
Nonetheless, the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference.	2.166431228655852
The alliances are therefore not faced with the transference, but rather with the resistance.	2.213449545599913
We report on a 15-months-old girl with a history of recurrent phlegmones of the lower eyelid, dacryocystitides, conjunctivities and mucositis together with growth-retardation, chronic obstipation and anal prolaps.	1.9423389763869696
Retrospectively, neutrophil counts were between 0-500/µl from birth on.	1.9809418496610127
Bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of granulopoiesis at the stage of promyelocytes.	2.0358820999808382
Continuous therapy with 10  µg/kg/d of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) induced 12-day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts.	1.9493494264713482
There were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines.	2.1062273422446025
A mutation in the G-CSF-receptor gene was not found in this patient.	2.422859766731077
After 2 years of therapy, a reduction of rhG-CSF dose (application every 2 days) lead to a severe neutropenia.	2.3901377245715096
We report a 31-year-old renal transplant patient treated with cyclosporin A who developed an unusual sebaceous gland hyperplasia accompanied by a disseminated follicular spiny hyperkeratosis.	2.061125302603321
Those alterations were most evident on his face and limbs.	2.257214512306993
In some locations hairy hyperkeratosis with authentic hair neogenesis was found.	1.966809134890447
The histology of these alterations showed a marked hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles with formation of hair-like spikes either alone or in connection with hairs.	2.192006524616517
The presence of true hairs distinguishes our case from the morphologically similar disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and other spiny keratinization disorders.	1.75597594411816
Scanning electron microscopy helped to demonstrate the hair-like structure of these keratoses.	2.30003097749604
Some of the sebaceous glands showed cystic widening of their lumina, which were filled with abundant amorphous eosinophilic material, a finding similar to earlier observations.	1.8641783697041785
Our case demonstrates that these skin alterations should be classified as side effects of cyclosporin A and that they are apparently dose-dependent.	2.112786377726429
Background: Since increased intraoperative iris irritation can lead to increased postoperative inflammation, we are interested in postoperative reactions to several varied surgical procedures.	2.0270013121889128
We performed pupil stretching, iridotomy with iris suture, and partial sphincterectomy.	1.952462309590744
Reports of accidental alkaloid-intoxications with plants of the nightshade family, in  particular Datura-species are well known in pediatric care.	1.9994955393896456
The intentional abuse as a hallucinogenic drug in adolescents became more frequent in recent years.	2.0753041309867126
Two patients, a 14- resp.	2.5411806343914365
In the present case of a granular cell tumor an abdomino-thoracal resection of the esophagus was performed in a 41-year-old patient after preoperative diagnosis had suggested esophageal cancer.	2.417625948748745
Granular cell tumors (Abrikossoff's tumor) of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis.	2.3993577819591807
Diagnosis can be obtained by endoscopic and histological study and immunohistochemical forceps biopsy.	2.2807158012337028
Because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor, it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma.	2.504616772400343
In the guidelines for determination of the blood alcohol level for forensic purposes, a correction factor of 1.2 has been established for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol based on the relationship of the water content between serum and whole blood.	2.2041120425519893
The reliability of the determination of the blood alcohol level is dependent on the possible minimum and maximum values of this correction factor.	2.2421198101303768
In a comprehensive multicenter study consisting of 833 samples, which can be considered representative of persons involved in offences under the drinking and driving act, an average quotient of 1.16 was found with minimum and maximum values of 1.08 and 1.21 respectively.	1.8302956819256886
In 96% of the cases the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19 and the deviation of the quotient from the average value was less than 3%.	2.197245772097922
From these results it can be assumed that the determination of blood alcohol is obviously more reliable than previously presumed.	2.290040211130361
In Germany, if the dermatologist has definite proof that a patient's skin disorder is severe or chronic, work-related and requiring a change in occupation, then he or she must issue a Berufskrankheitenanzeige (loosely translated as occupational disease notification).	1.7551879133751442
The patient's consent is not required for this mandatory form, which has to be submitted even if the patient is opposed.	2.538540990493952
The patient's permission is required for this less formal document.	2.287999972942085
Bone marrow involvement is often observed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.	2.555232952255635
Sensitive immunological and molecular biological methods allow the detection of isolated transformed cells in bone marrow samples.	2.410435495090099
Like normal hematopoietic cells, tumor cells interact with bone marrow stroma through adhesion molecules.	2.0722854016262873
Since adhesion mulecules play an essential role in the invasion and proliferation of malignant cells, new therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are conceivable.	2.0667897965126434
With the development of powerful computer systems, computer-assisted medical diagnosis and therapy have become common over the last 10 years.	2.5681041512820935
Even in the surgical field, computer- and robotic-assisted techniques are becoming practical but are not yet used on a daily basis.	2.1474796128147506
In the orthopaedic field, computer and robotic assistance is used in planning and performing demanding three-dimensional osteotomies, setting pedicle screws in the spine and milling the femoral medullary canal in total hip replacement.	1.9655180110165325
This article introduces a computer- and robotic-assisted system for performing arthroplasty in total knee replacement procedures.	1.9939263823822273
The hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man's work.	2.4457087834027424
The multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality, sensibility, motor function and stability.	2.364980370828726
In severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor.	2.8157363705024725
In a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand.	2.650448902007979
The cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw.	2.0596035284031893
Basically, we recommend an extended primary repair.	2.6477157818989276
After the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures.	2.3363971229997595
We start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints.	2.4686391631704145
Thereafter, suturing of extensor and flexor tendons.	2.1724536999948225
Then, we do the microsurgical reconstructions of vessels and nerves.	2.2437830881607255
In case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap.	2.1527813250172136
In a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first.	2.3260702261831154
Our results in vitality and sensibility are listed.	2.1940511157942804
In the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important.	2.292148422877617
Therefore, it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery.	2.221757794649126
A 34-year-old women had a hen's egg-sized supernumerary mammary gland with no nipple or areola in the left anterior axillary line for the last 8 years.	1.9332489000026372
The importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma.	1.9629345955643172
Early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended.	2.2333461310521234
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent drugs that are effective in the treatment of malignant tumors.	2.612926866993812
The cytotoxic action of these drugs is not fully understood, but it appears to be mediated mainly through mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis.	2.317416328017525
Because no information is available on the antiangiogenesis action of docetaxel, the investigations were performed to determine whether inhibition of neoangiogenesis plays a role in docetaxel's antitumor efficacy.	2.168924038458279
Four different mouse tumors, two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC-IV; SCC-VII) and two adenocarcinomas (MCA-4; MCA-29) were assayed for angiogenic activity using the in vivo i.c.	1.8756822066748653
Tumor cells (5 x 105) were injected i.c.	2.258419453524293
into the skin flap over the abdominal wall, and the number of new blood vessels at the tumor cell injection site was determined 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days later.	2.61772131656574
The mice were treated with docetaxel (Taxotere - 31.3 mg/kg i.v.)	2.448290395615753
1 or 4 days after tumor cell injection.	2.5925493539555626
The number of new blood vessels increased with time.	2.3077485399482263
Docetaxel reduced the number of newly formed blood vessels in MCAs, but not in SCCs.	2.716270588555161
The reduction was associated with slower tumor growth.	2.497850152099966
In a separate set of experiments we observed that docetaxel's inhibitory effect on the two MCAs was histologically associated with massive tumor cell destruction by means of both apoptosis and necrosis.	2.0334706439709334
This was not observed for the two SCCs.	2.6507580428613076
Since no reduction in blood vessels occurred in tumors unresponsive to docetaxel, the inhibition of neoangiogenesis in docetaxel-responsive tumors was likely the result of a decrease in angiogenic stimuli due to docetaxel's destruction of tumor cells.	2.0113231268547693
A patient on long term parenteral nutrition developed acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin changes.	1.9857678807288162
Just as in the autosomal recessive disorder, acrodermatitis enteropathica, the lesions in our patient were caused by zinc deficiency.	2.2720469258584197
Replacement therapy with zinc led to rapid improvement.	2.300022014606064
A measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants.	2.048291615883801
The implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the eardrum and the inner ear.	1.9308088237331587
A defined signal within the frequency range of 0-5 kHz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is  measured by a probe microphone.	1.936395383910171
Displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of 5 nm.	2.0606814699031313
The transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal.	2.167242023280605
This system can be used to evaluate the sound-transmitting properties of different middle ear implants excepting other influences, such as surgical techniques.	2.704784284014663
This work details the measurement system and demonstrates basic influences on the sound-transmission of middle ear implants.	2.057657061607588
In acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to PTCA regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events.	2.1676496042298914
It is, however, uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting.	2.3947438469547384
We, therefore, assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary PTCA and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result (provisional stenting).	2.700923140576033
In order to perform accurate low-flow anaesthesia ventilation, it is desirable to avoid the influence of fresh gas flow (FGF) and inspiration duration (ID) on the resulting minute volume (MV).	2.2503817625689497
The Sulla 808V anaesthesia ventilator (Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) is originally not equipped with a fresh-gas decoupling (FGD) device.	1.8282306861222197
Recently, a low-cost FGD device (Carbamed, Bern-Liebefeld, Switzerland) has been developed, which can be inserted into the circle system.	2.1872516797172463
We investigated the effect of this device on MV in the Sulla 808V anaesthesia apparatus.	2.2412560429769317
Background: In a multicenter study the association of psychosocial stress and the use of psychosocial support in patients with diabetes mellitus was evaluated.	2.7074409647389133
The diagnosis Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) in the neonate is difficult because features like neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems are easily misdiagnosed as a consequence of peripartal asphyxia.	1.973038296711069
Craniofacial abnormalities like narrow bifrontal diameter, almond shaped palpebral fissures and openend downturned mouth are underdiagnosed especially if respiratory treatment is necessary.	1.741314296402282
Hypogonadism in girls and in milder expression in boys (for example cryptorchism) are common and unspecific signs at that age.	1.9420413422746037
Typical features like obesity and hyperphagia, small hands and feet and small stature are not expressed until the second year.	1.994637849381875
The clinical course of PWS in the neonate is demonstrated in two cases.	2.3938421214637216
Diagnostic criteria and therapeutic intervention are discussed.	2.456277922233908
Hydrops fetalis as a seldom feature in PWS has to be taken into consideration.	2.2527467512107595
Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are an instrument for classification of inpatient cases.	2.235599632436975
DRGs are finding ever broader implementation internationally.	2.280088474106871
Targets for using DRGs are hospital financing and budgeting, cost accounting and quality assurance.	2.0110799099268744
The present survey covering 18 countries shows that so far DRGs are most frequently used for budgeting purposes.	2.0016554589903452
In addition to DRG-based reimbursement, further quality assurance is necessary, but this is only being implemented with hesitation.	2.04819382624143
The coverage planned for all inpatient cases through DRG-based reimbursement in Germany from 2003 on is a pioneering challenge internationally.	1.8363524929105435
Background: By law, applicants for driver's licenses not only have to have sufficient vision, but also have to use this sight reliably.	2.0081813428824846
The nystagmus patient takes advantage of ocularly induced head turns and other forms of compensation.	2.010723613680185
In the approved test procedures he is deprived of such compensations.	2.0188331913717206
Sinde the introduction of the bladder drainage technique, the number of pancreas transplants performed has now reached 1000/year worldwide.	2.4426834054449325
Most of these transplants have been performed in the United States.	2.5810955301512135
In contrast, the number of pancreas transplants performed in the Eurotransplant community has remained at a low level for several years.	2.1620118457074087
The results of a consecutive series of 20 simultaneous pancreas/kidney grafts (SPK) performed between June 1994 and October 1995 demonstrate that high graft function rates of 83.5 % for pancreas and kidney grafts can be achieved.	1.7562941031392625
Therefore SPK can be recommended as a standard procedure for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease in Germany, too.	2.6136100891817007
Intubation and Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation (PEEP) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function, particularly following blunt chest trauma.	2.1991395694212623
Complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) have only gained minor popularity.	1.854228929843169
In a prospective study, 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with CPAP administered by mask.	2.5426218965698024
The regime consisted of continuous administration of CPAP by a face-mask, with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing.	1.9366660159067526
Initially a FiO2 of 0.33 (range 0,28-0,38) proved necessary.	2.137121211693527
The initial CPAP level was 7 mbar (range 5-8) with an (Assisted Spontaneous Breathing) ASB of 15 mbar (range 13-18).	1.9859757518031445
FiO2 and CPAP/ASB levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary.	1.9847483943838422
In all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen.	2.1115060798937506
The treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur.	2.102672370466053
In comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average ICU stay was dramatically reduced, principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation.	1.908277467996884
Other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery, both physical and psychological.	1.9072578267341218
We conclude that non-invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications.	2.3895518377202123
Abstract:  Clinical findings and the correct assessment of the morphology and degree of stenosis is a decidant point in the conservative and operative therapy of carotid stenosis.	2.3426301119617547
Diagnosis should be reached fast, sure and cost-effective with a high sensitivity and specifity.	2.5007162426359066
Current methods for articular cartilage repair are unpredictable with respect to clinical success.	2.4448836226725077
In the present study, we investigated the ability of cells from articular cartilage, perichondrium, and costochondral resting zone to form new cartilage when loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into calf muscle pouches of nu/nu mice.	1.7999568027446065
Prior in vitro studies showed that platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), but not transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor, or bone morphogenetic protein-2 promoted proliferation and extracellular matrix sulfation of resting zone chondrocytes without causing the cells to exhibit a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype.	2.047441831436123
TGF-1 has also been shown to stimulate chondrogenesis by multipotent chondroprogenitor cells like those in the perichondrium.	2.3175971674298252
In addition, PDGF-BB has been shown to modulate chondrogensis by resting zone cells implanted in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds.	1.8324359434130386
In the present study we examined whether the cartilage formation is dependent on state of chondrocyte maturation and whether the pretreatment of chondrocytes with growth factors has an influence on the cartilage formation.	2.0383008134659706
Scaffolds were manufactured from 80 % PLG with a 75:25 lactide:glycolide ratio and 20 % modified PLG with a 50:50 lactide:glycolide ratio (PLG-H scaffolds).	1.7857257359325243
Only resting zone cells showed the ability to form new cartilage at a heterotopic site in this study.	2.2519538887921637
There was no neocartilage found in nude mice with implants loaded with either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells.	1.8035629983771775
Pretreatment of resting zone chondrocytes for 4 h prior to implantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed cartilage after 8 weeks and suppressed chondrocyte hypertrophy.	2.2110785370863777
The amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells decreased with time, whereas the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing resting zone chondrocytes pretreated with PDGF-BB was increased.	1.8354671125051012
The results showed that resting zone cells can be successfully incorporated into biodegradable porous PLG scaffolds and can induce new cartilage formation in a non-weight-bearing site.	2.0834865748718125
Articular chondrocytes as well as perichondrial cells did not have the capacity for neochondrogenesis when implanted heterotopically in this model.	2.4055153899579156
Bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity.	2.648206819996441
In spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological resemblance to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis.	1.7552393906777521
The biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation.	2.4166089690969237
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody.	2.282195459656626
Among high-grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation (average value 30 %) was found in comparison with low-grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors.	2.4984627673647273
This approach proved to be very useful in the distinction between high-grade and low-grade osteosarcomas as well as bone-forming intraosseous tumors.	2.924593135456387
However distinguishing low-grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible, although interestingly, the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans, a purely reactive lesion, was in the range of the values determined for high-grade osteosarcoma.	2.2192011267963947
Over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee.	2.4661750777227764
Among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials, the central bone patellar tendon bone graft, a quadrupled hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.	1.859758239353918
Each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties, graft fixation and graft incorporation.	1.9814130925470033
Clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others.	2.3869200506688775
When choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered.	2.4670168749667702
For the treatment of multiple ligament injuries and for revision cases, thorough preoperative planning is necessary and modified graft selection may be required.	2.223877543611182
Myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions.	1.9619667785776478
Frequent causes are intercurrent infections, fluctuations due to the natural history of the disease and insufficient immunosuppressive treatment prior to the crisis.	2.565835940078553
Early referral to an experienced neurologist is essential.	2.3097199814526794
Specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with clucocorticoids.	1.893858103724597
Infections must be treated vigorously.	2.609078273539829
Thymectomy in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized.	2.639935195142843
In cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties, early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed.	1.9659120518173416
Adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications adversely affecting prognosis.	2.122151943710744
Whenever it can be achieved, the best therapy of myasthenic crisis is its prevention by appropriate long-term management and follow-up of patients with myasthenia gravis.	2.8100014223699303
In a retrospective analysis we evaluated 48 patients who had been arthroscopically treated for tendinitis calcarea.	2.293741549563705
The calcific deposit was removed whenever possible and all patients were treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression.	2.5135043595555193
In subjects who showed subacromial stenosis by X-ray or by intraoperative findings, an arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed.	2.1470168435257206
At follow-up all patients were evaluated according to the Constant score.	3.1395359844665767
Additionally all pre- and postoperative X-rays were reviewed.	2.646170463879167
After surgery the Constant score significantly improved.	2.3909775010377494
In all cases where acromioplasty was performed, a flattening of the bony configuration was achieved.	2.274575171404053
The X-ray analysis showed that no calcific deposit with blurred borders converted to sharp borders.	2.154501395124742
Patients with disappearance of the calcific deposit postoperatively had significantly better outcome than patients with no change in the X-ray.	2.173130250105534
An additional acromioplasty did not improve the results.	2.2734963986464845
Acromioplasty does not lead to further improvement of the result.	3.006868383944505
Preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity (H2ms (sucralfate, antacids, pirenzepine) and to normalize gastric mucosal microcirculation (sucralfate, pirenzepine).	1.8364032756418394
Thus, the most important prophylactic measure is an optimized emergency and ICU regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation.	2.175193237204746
All specific drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled studies.	2.316586129058082
Furthermore, pirenzepine has been found to be superior to H2-antagonists, at least in neurosurgical patients.	2.302488728115504
Insufficient or no data exist to support the use of prostaglandins or omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.	2.3515619115835817
The most important adverse effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis is nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric alkalinization.	1.924581874653253
This may occur in long-term ventilated patients with a gastric pH>4 and may account for up to 50% of all nosocomial pneumonias in certain groups of patients.	2.601627143372516
Mortality is not influenced by antacids or H2-antagonists, while sucralfate has been shown to reduce mortality, most probably by inhibition of bacterial translocation.	2.087340393965869
Three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy, a 66-year-old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure.	2.1513660701029527
Malignant tumor cells were discovered within extensive pleural effusion.	2.2958528768730955
Computed tomography revealed two lesions of the liver suspicious of metastases, and recurrent blood in the stools was evident.	2.199817065905043
The patient deteriorated rapidly and died 3 weeks after admission.	2.2614927207249353
High-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of plasmoblastic differentiation was diagnosed, located within the mediastinal soft tissue and infiltrating the peri- and myocardium.	1.9472635107701108
Mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged with histological verification of malignant lymphoma.	2.3939521783251934
The lymphatic tumor masses had caused considerable compression of the heart and vessels, leading to the signs of cardiac failure.	2.482377782372005
The development of metastasizing colonic carcinoma and high-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 3 years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy must be considered an unusual combination.	2.177445824376542
Malignant lymphomas following heart transplantation have been described several times.	2.5367382459676318
Infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance.	2.372244436516024
For internal control, they may only be used under the condition of homogeneous data collection and evaluation according to identical standard operating procedures during the entire investigation period.	1.9231780108601413
For inter-hospital comparison, they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable.	2.0282861320258907
A survey of the infection rates published during the last 6 years in the German traumatological literature (n = 71) indeed shows (concerning series later than 1985) similar infection rates for procedures in less and in more problematic anatomical regions and in clean and contaminated situations of about 2 - 3%, after open injuries sporadically max.	1.9603116612023266
Finally, it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general "risk of infection" based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa.	2.354433115645806
We strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection.	2.3807354690976212
For all mentioned "infection rates" it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement.	2.3755235164303476
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are useful techniques for the objective documentation of the relation between the femoral head and the acetabulum after closed or open reduction of a developmental dislocation of the hip joint.	2.239542266869855
Before the ossification nucleus of the femoral head is sufficiently developed, MRI is preferred.	2.3116610293583637
For the evaluation of reduction from the 2nd year on, MRI and CT are equivalent.	2.377819196641497
However, in older children MRI may also be indicated for the evaluation of cartilaginous structures or the diagnosis of femoral head necrosis.	2.6200339261522267
CT in older patients may also be useful for 30 analysis of bony structures, e. g. for planning complex osteotomies.	2.57214308645513
Careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures.	2.572659018179777
This is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non-unions of these carpal bones.	2.6585338484325534
Conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options.	2.304935698487733
Out of the patients who underwent surgery from January 1993 to February 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non-union were, in addition to standard X-ray examination, examined clinically and by MRI pre- and post-operatively.	2.601767629551244
Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixtion.	2.444524055704339
When there is a possibility that tissue samples have been interchanged, DNA analysis of the histological specimens can be carried out to correctly assign the specimens to a patient.	2.2891565415345854
The use of polymerase chain reaction enables results to be obtained even from degraded DNA in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples.	1.8444983304676679
A review of 110 children with Burkitt's lymphoma admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during a 7-year period revealed a preponderance of males over females (1.9 : 1) and a peak incidence at five years.	2.0157137461807078
The main sites affected initially by the tumour in order of frequency were the face and abdomen.	2.096432886977102
The spinal column, spleen, and lungs were less affected.	2.2072459691676536
It is postulated that an interaction between malarial and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition are important in the aetiology of the tumour.	2.0442330151395782
The most effective drug is cyclophosphamide.	2.374560090574766
A combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing remissions, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse.	1.9893476523121294
Follow-up of the patients revealed good survival.	3.3667318093468013
The consumption of the jet set drug Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymetamphetamine, abbreviated to MDMA) by young people is increasing markedly.	1.9124622728497365
Parallel to this developement, there is a large number of reports on severe neurological, psychiatric and medical complications following the use of Ecstasy.	2.5930855613639694
The term "mild cognitive impairment" refers to cognitive deficits which exceed normal physiological aging processes, but do not fulfill the criteria for dementia.	1.8648912674131541
The prevalence rates of four current concepts were compared in a sample of 202 healthy 60-64 year-old participants recruited from the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging (ILSE).	2.011794630577274
Furthermore, the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined.	2.0662421271937603
The following prevalence rates were determined: 13.5% for age-associated memory impairment, 6.5% for age-consistent memory impairment, 1.5% for late-life forgetfulness and 23.5% for aging-associated cognitive decline.	1.7685057307439123
Subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests.	2.3446064435739626
Significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales.	1.938247995504338
Significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status.	2.1494436227955944
Longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts.	2.27150501472667
In a retrospective study, we evaluated 180 patients treated for painful spondylolisthesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion.	2.349728261599641
Group I included 90 patients treated by anterior fusion with the transperitoneal approach.	2.2668509151920366
Group II included 90 patients operated on with a retroperitoneal approach.	2.2059855075038173
Group II showed a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis L5/S1 (4 %), tear of the common iliac vein (1 %), postsympathectomy syndrome (4 %) and reversible L4 nerve-root lesion (3 %).	2.4995780269056964
On the basis of our findings, we recommend the transperitoneal approach for anterior interbody fusion L5 to S1 or L4 to S1.	2.020258635534097
Coronary surgery is at this point of time the standard therapy of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis.	2.42768288917035
Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is performed only in bail out situations.	2.2065604819283466
The number of publications of successful percutaneous intervention in unprotected left main coronary stenosis is increasing because of increasing use of stents and ticlopidine to avoid stent-thrombosis.	1.7929225118398324
The test battery had been applied short time before, during and after the treatment with 10 ECT applied unilateral over the nondominant hemisphere.	2.1062724412405247
Comparing the test performances before and 1-2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes: a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in 30 min delayed recall of verbal items, while visual short-term memory and visual-constructive performance showed a significant improvement (in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side).	2.1332898564869645
None of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was detracted short time after the end of the ECT-treatment, instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly.	1.9164408074278805
The non-responders had in nearly all of the tests some better (but not significantly) results despite being older than the group of responders.	2.1310774570046247
In this study we assessed the drawing abilities in 37 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.	1.8098883416124656
Drawing abilities (drawing: house, flower, clock; Rey-Osterrieth figure; copying: MMST-figure; Rey-Osterrieth figure) were quantified with different rating schemes and related to other neuropsychological assessments.	1.6697313051749576
All patients underwent a positron emission tomography with 18-FDG.	2.2842449236807885
Drawing performance was highly correlated with severity of dementia - expressed in MMST scores (r=0.78; p<0.0001) - with visuo-spatial short-term memory (r=-0.69; p=0.001), and writing abilities (r=-0.77; p<0.0001).	2.0576116776456654
The summarized drawing score showed a statistically significant correlation with the rate of temporoparietal glucose metabolism measured with positron emission tomography and 18-FDG (r=0.39; p=0.017).	2.1462824276668693
In the drawings of AD patients omittings and simplifications were typical, whereas perseverations rarely occured.	1.8754440247233448
In severely demented patients closing-in phenomenons could be de- scribed, too.	1.9448654481456997
A subgroup of AD patients with visuo-constructive impairment as the leading symptom could not be identified.	2.3404314477320227
Since the first dermatological outpatient clinic was started in Dresden in 1869, it has seen the practice of dermatology in the broadest sense, with scientific research activity and innovation.	1.8875297607303752
The good working relationship between the dermatologists in private practice and those in the clinics has been the main factor in this successful development.	2.222440520116106
The traditional background of the following sectors is highlighted: outpatient clinic, X-ray and UV ligth treatment, allergology and occupational dermatology, psychosomatic dermatology, dermatosurgery, and phlebology.	2.050305721906118
A 12-year-old girl from Zaire with Aids (CDC: P2 D1) presented with a generalized molluscum contagiosum infection.	2.142252760665996
She had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis and from cryptosporidiosis several months before admission.	2.1650045850691604
While molluscum contagiosum infection is usually a self-limiting disease in immunocompetent persons, a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant mollusca occurs with advanced immunodeficiency.	1.9432115401382317
Histological and immunohistological examinations showed a severe diminution of Langerhans and T cell populations that might enhance the dissemination of the infection.	1.9449975836885272
Molluscum-like lesions of cryptococci have been described, and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	2.441927836959216
Further differential diagnoses should include American and African histoplasmosis, and the cutaneous manifestations of mycobacterial infections, of toxoplasmosis and of Pneumocystis carinii infection.	2.1811529476247635
The search for vascular structures in skin tumors by incident light microscopy has revealed a surprisingly high proportion of vascularized tumours.	1.9639754167967596
Characteristic vascular patterns, in some cases highly tumour-specific, have been defined.	2.584540755167429
The vascular structure is a valuable feature for characterization and differentiation of skin tumours, especially for amelanotic malignant melanoma.	2.1960509762546074
We propose a flowchart procedure for analysis and diagnosis of skin tumours using incident light microscopy, which appears to be valuable for advanced image analytic techniques.	2.001340469883343
Introduction: The treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily.	2.268466083548149
Current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation (OCT) and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT).	2.1000461956843157
Methods: With a prospective clinical investigation, at the time being with 2-year results, we have examined ACT in comparison to OCT in 20 patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological (histology, immunohistochemistry, RES) outcome.	2.660873990019999
Results: We found equally good results with both methods in Lysholm, Meyers and Tegner Activity Scores.	1.964194013487532
Histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after ACT showed a defect filling in all cases, mainly with fibrous cartilage, while localized areas of hyalinelike regenerative cartilage were documented near the base.We did not see any histomorphologically visible change in the transplants after OCT.	1.809256315534855
Conclusion: At the time we prefer OCT instead of ACT given the correct indication.	2.1996880975054007
We report two patients with episodic unilateral limb shaking lasting up to several minutes and which could be triggered by orthostasis, heat or physical exertion.	1.8787940205095075
Repeated EEG recordings revealed no epileptic discharges.	2.336981623601567
In both patients, duplex ultrasonography revealed an occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) contralateral to the side of the RIMs.	2.277142532703178
Blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to ICA occlusion were reduced and vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was absent.	1.9106705156864132
After elevation of blood pressure both patients became asymptomatic.	2.5240164183394023
We suggest that in patients with episodes of RIMs, Doppler sonography and tests of cerebral vascular reserve capacity should be performed to search for a hemodynamic origin of these symptoms.	2.3387342583529915
Ethylene dichloride (EDC) is used as a solvent and in the rubber, plastic, and insecticide industry.	2.241786557399073
The fatal adult dose is below 20 ml.	2.255847882598024
Poisoning can occur from inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption.	2.1970228205946176
Death is usually due to liver or central nervous failure.	2.2341676512175432
Retrospectively analyzing the history of three patients with gastrointesinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated over a period of 1 year in the surgical department of our regional hospital, we tried to answer the following questions: using the current recommendations in the literature, how are the macro- and microscopic features and clinical presentation to be interpreted?	2.1809238688361288
Which prognostic and therapeutic conclusions should we draw, giving special consideration to practice-orientated management of such cases.	2.0039672893731857
The patients were 65, 75 and 88 years old respectively, and in each case the GIST manifested as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.	2.1183043406845163
During surgical treatment four gastric tumors ranging in cross section between 2.5 and 8 cm were found.	1.917945741025575
The GIST diagnosis was established after light microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations.	2.181322435186347
Going through the current literature, a large number of structural and immunohistochemical criteria have come to light for determining its classification and potential malignancy.	2.084753961640545
On the other hand, very few subsequent recommendations concerning therapy and prognosis can be found and follow-up recomendations are almost unavailable.	2.2139721192938486
We conclude that GISTs are difficult to diagnose because of their locality and that their clinical behavior is uncertain.	2.100307420886345
The potential malignancy, on the other hand, requires a well-founded diagnostic procedure in the form of the best possible pre-therapeutic staging.	2.484095037139313
Furthermore, initially radical surgical treatment should be adopted and the follow-up should be adapted to the risk involved.	2.5696838251869694
The latter is arbitrary and further clinical studies are required.	2.2346942156950154
In animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs.	2.0209688763253713
According to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today, it could potentially be applied in infants in the future, too.	2.41183918998556
However, the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase III studies to be conducted.	1.880104846070267
Further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems.	2.061963318063729
Taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today, we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support; however, further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified.	1.9243937261198367
The role of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) in primary malignant melanoma is controversial.	2.155934286137503
Our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of ELND regarding survival and disease-free survival in malignant melanoma of the trunk and extremities.	2.5223668118921396
By matched-pair analysis, 375 patients treated by wide local excision (WLE) plus ELND were compared to 375 patients treated by WLE only.	2.0415905695326777
There was no difference in survival between the two treatment groups; however, the disease-free interval was significantly higher in the collective treated by WLE plus ELND (P<0.05).	2.2700397963435512
Increased survival rates were noted for intermediate tumor thickness of 1.51-4.0 mm for the WLE+ELND group although the difference was not significant (P=0.14), and disease-free survival was significantly improved in this group (P<0.001).	2.2855004850739764
ELND elicited a higher benefit in male patients with intermediate thickness melanoma.	2.216207241173483
Our results confirm the findings of several studies that ELND improves the outcome after primary treament of malignant melanoma of intermediate tumor thickness.	2.2422510814346874
7 patients (5 female, 2 male; age:  22-81 years; average age=58,1 J) with recurrent necrotizing ANCA-negative, non leucocytoclastic vasculitis, were enrolled into this study.	1.9025906228345237
Disease was resistant to prior conservative therapy, and therefore patients received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) - (dose: 1,0 g/kg body weight daily dose 0,25 g/kg body weight over 4 consecutive days).	1.9569834679331404
All patients responded rapidly to this therapeutic regimen.	2.269156693997546
Specifically immediate pain relief was striking.	2.6666272285055026
Complete clearance of disease was observed in 5 out of 7 patients within 6 months while receiving IVIG (0,5 g/kg body weight) every 4 weeks for one year.	2.3011932074766643
In 2 out of 5 patients ulceration and vasculitis healed completly and therapy could be stopped after 6 months.	2.049427601183352
In one patient treatment had to be discontinued due to decreasing kidney function.	2.308766160452713
The data presented demonstrate that IVIG is an  effective and valuable therapeutic modality in treatment of severe vasculitis resistant to conventional therapy.	2.248972482589676
However consideration of costs, effectiveness and possible side effects is needed for this therapeutic regime.	2.3323167579677424
After orthopedic surgery, skeletal muscle will enter the rehabilitation process in weakened condition due to the following characteristics.	2.3589361208103905
After use of a tourniquet during surgery, the muscle suffers ischemia/reperfusion damage due to oxidative stress, resulting in structural impairment.	2.2849376805435786
The resulting immobilization leads to muscular atrophy, with a loss of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress being of etiological significance.	2.090874706625373
Degeneration of muscle fibers as well as regeneration occurs in muscle while still immobilized.	2.5599359081265582
After remobilization, the muscle has impaired functional capacity and frequently shows disturbances in its innervation pattern.	1.9860371295481594
High mechanical loading should therefore be avoided, and electrical stimulation may be applied to facilitate recovery.	2.3839104635176147
Considering the role of oxygen radicals, supplementation with vitamin E appears generally recommendable.	2.1841577132557757
The timing of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy - especially if combined with chemotherapy - has been a subject of interest over the past years.	2.415569934908456
This analysis was based on a literature review of mostly retrospective publications.	2.6566354848071456
Data concerning the interval between surgery and radiotherapy were correlated with the locoregional control, incidence of distant metastases and prognosis of breast cancer, lung carcinoma, and head and neck carcinomas.	2.433147761602118
The reviewed data did not show a clear relationship of the time interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy and locoregional control.	2.2856774805393405
However, evaluation of the data was difficult, because in most publications, retrospective analyses were performed and other prognostically more relevant parameters may influence locoregional control stronger than the time interval.	2.105532403669496
In patients with head and neck carcinomas, there is a negative effect of time interval between surgery and radiotherapy on local control if unfavorable factors exist, i. e., close surgical margins, unfavorable pathohistological parameters and low radiation dose.	2.048443341571153
In patients with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy, there are inconsistent reports in the literature.	2.3252926025422207
If additional chemotherapy is necessary, the sequence surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems adequate.	2.2779512951806336
Although some data suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy due to chemotherapy may increase the risk or local recurrences, there may, on the other hand, be an increased likelihood of systemic metastases, if radiotherapy is applied before chemotherapy.	2.0183354191925953
Concerning lung cancer, only one retrospective analysis exists suggesting a better survival of patients with an interval of more than 36 days between surgery and radiotherapy as compared to patients with a shorter interval.	2.88776911527733
The treatment of severely injured patients is a challenge for preclinical and clinical treatment concepts, causing financial aspects of increasing importance for the German health care system.	2.256568688140484
A total of 32,500 polytraumatized patients (PTS III and IV) are managed in trauma center levels I-IV in Germany.	2.10264222072431
Trauma center levels I or II are by definition capable of supporting the full range of treatment for the severely injured.	2.13005254410177
With the baseline calculation of 64,000 DM per patient and 104 polytrauma treated per year in the Berlin Virchow Clinic, 6.66 million DM primary costs must be spent for treatment.	1.8270204015876796
The total annual costs of this center are nearly 24 million DM for emergency cases and 7 million DM fixed costs per year, for a trauma center level I.	1.9082541466298302
In Europe the distribution of trauma center levels I or II is sufficient and can be specified with 1 center per 1 million inhabitants.	2.1329565113424738
Nevertheless, the european air medical service could support more intensive use of these central trauma institutions.	1.9669473492982679
Less then half of these patients are treated in levels I or II trauma centers.	2.7217009371044245
The financial pressure on the health system and the rising quality must lead to better utilization of trauma centers.	2.124123614667199
The claim of the American College of Surgeons that a trauma surgeon should treat 50 severely injured patients per year would then be possible.	1.9882859354276297
This report is a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies given to adults in a private practice setting and furthermore a study of the stability of the therapeutic results achieved.	2.2451067856790616
In the spring of 1997 a total of 16 bioenergetic therapists (6 of them medical doctors and 10 psychologists), all members of the Swiss Society of Bioenergetic Therapists (SGBAT), provided upon request a number of data on 319 patients who had terminated their therapies after a minimum of 20 sessions 6 months to 6 years earlier.	1.9269724686523877
A self-evaluating questionnaire was then constructed, to be answered anonymously, and was sent to these 319 patients in late summer 1997; 290 of them could be reached and 142 (49%) returned it.	1.941619840548961
The questionnaire contained questions related to the psychic and physical condition, to interpersonal and psychosomatic problems, and to the effect of body work on physical consciousness, cognitive insights and changes of the quality of life.	2.4922650239410444
Regarding the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies, the statistical analysis of the returned questionnaires showed significant positive changes in all areas questioned.	2.2408408688180996
Bioenergetic body work was judged to be important and indispensable by about half of the patients.	2.3859785007957215
Regarding the stability of the therapeutic result, 107 patients indicated a stable or even improved condition.	2.1833977330270455
Of the 35 patients who since termination of the bioenergetic therapy had chosen to undergo further therapy, 16 opted again for a body-oriented psychotherapy.	1.9064356770117319
Purpose: In a clinical study 35 patients with intracranial aneurysms were examined using CT-angiography, MR-angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA).	2.030919613068887
The aim of the study was to establish the ability of noninvasive techniques to detect intracranial aneurysms.	2.1992707304067505
"Classic" choroidal neovascularization (CNV) has a relatively uniform appearance in fluorescein angiography.	2.0783478155272834
In contrast, indocyanine green (ICG) angiography shows variable features of well-defined CNV.	1.9750811363862741
We examined 31 classic CNV patients secondary to age-related macular degeneration using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Angiograph) in order to determine ICG characteristics of classic CNV.	1.9345843929947588
Vascular patterns (97%), a hypofluorescent rim (84%), a hyperfluorescent margin (42%), late ICG leakage (32%) and "feeder vessels" were identified in variable frequency.	2.0855198086858686
Some of the ICG characteristics may correlate with histological features of the membrane and reflect proliferative activity.	2.1420280972743035
Extrafoveal "feeder vessels" may be amenable to laser photocoagulation in the presence of subfoveal CNV.	2.266765180728502
In situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in dermatopathology.	1.9842373072904853
These techniques can combine the sensitivity of PCR with the advantage of in situ hybridization to localize specific cellular structures.	2.162657406074007
With optical control of the PCR reaction product in these techniques, false-positive results due to contamination can be minimized.	2.3220650097167264
Several working protocols have been established which allow detection of DNA and RNA sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner.	2.117484884648096
Two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product, the indirect PCR in situ hybridization (PCRisHyb), and the direct in situ PCR (is PCR).	2.305491475815571
An easy and reproducible method for PCRisHyb and isPCR in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared.	1.938508391776976
Using both isPCR and PCRisHyb, the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue.	2.0378318007129597
Indirect PCRisHyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct isPCR was the quicker, easier and less expensive method.	1.8360898791543225
In a randomized study 30 patients with chronic stationary psoriasis were treated with 3 different topical schemes.	2.6190379195421754
Group 1 (n=10) received monotherapy (dithranol (D) twice a day, D/D), group 2 (n=10) calcipotriol mornings/dithranol evenings (calcipotriol (C)/dithranol (D) C/D) and 3 (mometasone (M) mornings/dithranol (D) evenings, M/D).	1.9017730492992444
During the therapy period of 4 weeks we documented the PASI-Score as well as infiltration, erythema and desquamation weekly.	2.3126895287946696
The C/D group (PASI 10,5) show a not significantly faster reduction.	2.191629813742813
After 4 weeks of treatment and after a follow period of 6 weeks there were similar PASI-Scores in all groups.	2.2513918527050634
There were less side-effects in the M/D group than in the others.	2.5781498468495063
The beginning, more anti-psoriatic effectiveness was achieved by the mometasone/dithranol combination than the other schemes.	2.048801080131367
In the long term, the effects were similar.	2.7037523594636736
This report describes a distinctive pattern of findings in peripheral sensory-nociceptive afferent nerves after spinal injury.	1.9234070482838188
Subsequent to trauma there was segmental, multisegmental or hemilateral hypoaesthesia with refractory, intenseful painful symptoms.	1.873595288786541
None of the classical neurological causes for such hypoaesthesia were present.	2.1783798898553974
"Normal" therapy resulted in more severe symptoms.	2.5087826506339708
Depending on the distribution of the hypo- or anaesthesia, there were also efferent symptoms (coordination problems, impairments of proprioception, etc.).	1.9490213186921714
Colleagues who have made similar observations or are familiar with these symptoms are cordially invited to assist with the interpretation of this clinical picture.	2.0584328358848363
The pharynx, being part of the digestive as well as the respiratory system, is embedded in the complex spatial anatomy of the neck and, due to its function and location, represents a very sophisticated region.	2.5837830323930158
Cisatracurium (51W89, Nimbex, Glaxo-Wellcome), an intermediate-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, is a stereoisomer of atracurium.	1.8388711224338572
Histamine releasing propensities and serum tryptase level have been investigated after administration of cisatracurium (3xED95, 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) in surgical patients.	1.9009063944192062
Methods: After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to receive either 3xED95 or 5xED95 cisatracurium, or 3xED90 vecuronium as a rapid bolus.	1.7105365377621307
A prick test was done the day before by scarification of the skin in the forearm.	2.3824407587937753
After premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5-2 vol.%).	1.9539243192672417
Six minutes after thiopentone, the patients received the relaxant, and after further 6 min 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	2.0302318605356158
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	1.9833581138331442
Blood samples for histamine were withdrawn 5 min prior 3 and 5 min after each drug administration (thiopentone, relaxants).	1.8912148409331215
Plasma histamine was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 pg/ml.	2.3267783099158983
Levels for histamine >1000 pg/ml and for tryptase >2 µg/ml were considered significant.	2.2900672670822058
Cutaneous signs of histamine release were documented.	2.443701365035222
Results: Ten patients showed a positive prick-test reaction.	2.6282286858573225
Only after thiopentone some cutaneous signs (4 flush, 1 erythema) of histamine release were observed.	1.922748607520898
Analysis of the blood samples demonstrated no significant increase in the histamine level in all three groups.	2.7578852241950926
Only in 1 patient was a significant higher histamine level (1133 pg/ml) measured 5 min after 5xED95 cisatracurium.	2.454748971422547
All measurements of serum tryptase were within the physiological limits.	2.3648632927844373
Discussion: In this study, with the particular time course of drug administration, neither cisatracurium nor vecuronium increased plasma histamine levels.	2.37874360601061
Only after 5xED95 cisatracurium was 1 elevated histamine level documented after 5 min.	2.036851655929078
In several studies increased histamine levels have been described, but without clinical manifestations.	2.3470653947164903
It is known that cutaneous signs can occur without increased plasma histamine levels due to the structural heterogeneity of mast cells.	2.1569280866870892
The cutaneous reactions in this study were caused by thiopentone.	2.794241135420331
The tryptase values were within normal limits even in the patient with histamine release.	2.562670265027382
No relationship between the positive results in the prick test and the incidence of cutaneous reactions and/or histamine release for drugs used in the induction of anaesthesia was observed.	2.809517352433737
Whether cisatracurium has a potential for immunologic release is unknown.	2.263268233234594
We report on a psychosis caused by application of a transdermal scopolamine patch for over 15 days.	2.0490553583891624
In the literature there is no mention of a case in which scopolamine had such an influence nor are any cases reported in which paranoid-hallucinatory symptoms cortinued 11 days after removing the patch.	1.9457852287516186
Bone and joint tuberculosis, as all other types of tuberculosis is generally treated with antituberculotic combination chemotherapy.	1.9838749794179296
This has to be continued for a minimum of six months, or nine months in case of extensive spreading.	2.597011623226599
A two- to three-month initial phase with four or five different drugs (H, R, Z, and additionally E and/or S) is followed by a four- to six-month therapy with H and R alone, provided the pathogen is fully susceptible to a standard regimen.	1.8981484404199267
The main side effects are hepatotoxic or allergic reactions.	2.3456324588923123
A frequent contra-indication is existing, often toxicity-induced, liver damage.	1.990167185311776
The main local complications requiring surgery are spinal instability or neurologic deficiencies.	2.0614246360122
This report concerns the case of a patient who had suffered a massive pulmonary embolus and for whom, despite immediately administered thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA it became necessary to initiate reanimation procedures.	2.1226545478806145
The patient was subsequently admitted to our cardiac surgery clinic for the purpose of operative intervention.	2.222511873714423
During the course of a 3-hour period of extracorporal circulation, the initially significantly elevated pulmonary pressures were able to be reduced to moderate levels.	2.4628518379528797
Correspondingly, right ventricular recovery could be echocardiographically determined.	2.20006371459653
As a consequence of this development, and after preclusion the presence of any large thrombotic masses which might have been situated in the pulmonary trunk, it was possible to forego thoracotomy and embolectomy.	2.2523178827349772
This procedure allowed, on the one hand, the avoidance of imminent right ventricular failure through the use of the heart-lung machine.	2.6470775968342104
On the other, due to the lessening of the degree of surgical intervention, the risk of grave hemorrhaging as a result of concurrent thrombolytic therapy could be minimalized.	2.6370085880259184
After an uneventful course, the patient was able to be transferred on the second postoperative day with normal pulmonary pressure values.	2.5397123083585074
Objectives Correction of bone deformities at metaphyseo-epiphyseal level of long bones through a corticotomy and gradual distraction.	1.8968587862353499
Restoration of shape and function of lower limb.	2.4925046785481775
Septic abortion remains one of the most serious threats to the health and life of women throughout the world.	2.3120976188911833
Morbidity and mortality are infrequent in countries where induced abortion is legal and medically well organized, but widespread in many developing countries where it is either illegal or inaccessible.	1.7929578101414156
We observed two patients with stone formation in the renal pelvis two and five years after pyeloplasty.	2.334036253864144
In both cases there was no obstruction of the pyeloureteral junction detectable.	2.4427662292411783
We consider the use of Polyglactin (Vicryl) for the pelvis suture as reason for the stone formation.	2.497505029552014
Aim of the study: The aim was to determine the efficiency of a secure control of ventilation in emergency medicine by using capnometry.	2.494189223871514
This question was of special interest for mechanically ventilated patients with cerebral diseases, because here hyperventilation as well as hypoventilation can result in severe consequences.	2.419665695177789
The advent of the excimer laser has brought about the potential for improved vision in many individuals with myopia and astigmatism.	2.0355323591005923
However, photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) remains a matter of controversy.	1.9997079156168736
The purpose of our study was to determine the predictability of VISX 20/20 excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy in the treatment of myopic astigmatism.	2.145539183852344
In Germany, insect allergies cause about 10-40 death per year.	2.0290954473945964
Starting a specific immunotherapy (SIT) and its maintenance may be lifesaving for the allergic patients.	2.0047838128887197
Performing a prospective study, we exactly documented effects and side effects during the induction phase of SIT using a purified aqueous yellow jacket venom preparation in 20 patients allergic to yellow jacket venom (clinical degree II-IV).	2.040602188442404
Indication for the therapy was defined individually for each patient and was based on a score incorporating the following criteria: a) clinical symptoms, b) in-vivo- and in-vitro testing, c) risk of re-sting.	2.2713487407912267
SIT was started under inpatient conditions following a standardized 8 day protocol.	2.1037013593229412
At the end of the induction phase all patients tolerated the maintenance dose of 100 µg of yellow jacket venom without complications even though all showed local side effects (threshold doses 0.01-10 µg, median value 0.2 µg).	1.8416846731036354
40% of all patients showed subjective side effects (median value of threshold dose 30 µg, range 0.2-60 µg) and 30% showed objective side effects (median value of threshold dose 55 µg, range 20-80 µg); however, all side effects were clinically mild.	1.9698898313436546
When objective systemic side effects were seen, the cumulative daily dose was 39-210 µg (median value 135 µg), exceeding 100 µg in 83% of patients.	1.9726143493754296
Our prospective study confirmed that the chosen protocol for SIT is effective in inducing tolerance to the venom preparation.	2.0053156067060955
A 76 year old patient with actinic reticuloid was treated with Cyclosporin A.	2.5869254192718705
11 months after beginning the immunosuppressive therapy, he developed lymphoedema and livid nodular skin lesions of the right leg, which histologically showed Kaposi's sarcoma.	2.2966507312253155
After stopping the Cyclosporin A and intralesional therapy with Interferon alpha, no regression of the Kaposi sarcoma could be seen.	1.9476068886224622
The characteristics of Kaposi sarcoma arising during immunosuppressive therapy and the differences in incidence, risk groups and distribution pattern compared to the classic sporadic and the AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma will be described.	2.080376845576663
The development of Kaposi sarcoma during immunosuppressive therapy for actinic reticuloid has not been previously described.	2.1809061351258676
This analysis was undertaken to review the outcome and toxicity of postoperative adjuvant therapy for Stage II and III rectal cancer.	2.1902085993159903
We reviewed 112 patients treated with radiotherapy (44 patients) and radiochemotherapy (68 patients) after potentially curative (R0) surgery for rectal cancer (UICC Stages II and III), between 1983 and 1994 at the University Clinic of Würzburg.	2.023953902059637
Median radiation dose was 56 Gy (range: 45 to 66 Gy).	2.0731264160693557
Chemotherapy consisted of 4 to 6 courses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (420 mg/m2/d) and leucovorin (200 mg/m2/d).	2.3144944259149067
Median follow-up was 37 months.	3.23739664890613
The overall survival was 84% for patients with UICC Stage II and 45% for patients with UICC Stage III disease (p = 0.0045).	2.2494601310438918
There were no statistically significant differences between patients treated with radiochemotherapy vs radiotherapy in terms of 5-year survival (63% after radiochemotherapy vs 53% after radiotherapy, p = 0.16), relapse-free survival (52% vs 50%) and locoregional control (69% vs 67%).	2.163581576883504
UICC Stage III disease was associated with high failure rates (40% pelvic recurrences and 53% distant metastases).	2.178850478883318
There was a statistically significant difference in terms of the incidence of distant metastases between the 2 treatment modalities for patients with Stage III disease (49% 5-year probability for developing distant metastases after radiochemotherapy vs 66% after radiotherapy, p = 0.047).	2.3464849796238134
In a multivariate analysis, the addition of chemotherapy, lymph node stage and grading were independent prognostic factors for survival.	2.1866547632998015
Severe late toxicity was documented in 5% of treated patients.	2.40973321806094
Prognosis of patients with UICC Stage III rectal cancer remains poor after "standard" surgery followed by postoperative adjuvant treatment (pelvic radiotherapy and bolus intravenous injection of 5-FU and leucovorin).	2.1218168758604006
Major efforts should be made in order to improve prognosis for these patients, including optimization of surgical treatment and systemic treatment.	2.9248001536648394
More effective multimodality treatment strategies should be investigated in prospective randomized trials.	2.3620041491105157
Andy Warhol underwent dermabrasion in 1957 because of a nasal skin lesion, which is best diagnosed as a rhinophyma on the basis of the available biographical literature.	2.464357515187789
Throughout his creative life, the artist worked on different aspects of plastic surgery especially in the nasal area.	2.229506891739621
As one of the founders of Pop-Art, Warhol left essential marks on the modern society and influenced our standards of aesthetic shapes.	1.9007812190136169
Objective: The clinical activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not reliably reflected by laboratory measures.	2.228156179672751
Proteolytic enzymes involved in the cascade of joint destruction are potentially useful parameters to monitor the extent of joint inflammation in RA.	2.3415504555727815
This study compares the validity of two classes of proteolytic enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsin B, H, and L) as well as their respective inhibitors to serve as parameters of RA disease activity.	1.8809131072254666
Only cerebrospinal fluid pheresis, administered as final alternative, lead to definite improvement and cure.	1.9745924372368897
Invasive selective coronary angiography as a clinical method is about 40 years old.	2.2859081291319763
This article surveying this period, written by an R&D engineer, deals with four parts: first the situation before 1965 is touched upon.	1.7485568577777084
For the time after 1965 the second and third parts describe the development of the procedure and of the technique with special reference to the work of Prof. Dr. K. Bachmann and to the facility, which in 1967 was designed together with him and further developed.	2.295642463391711
K. Bachmann had already taken up the method of invasive coronary angiography around 1965, which makes him one of the group of pioneering users who developed the fundamentals of the procedure and led coronary angiography to its self-evident use today.	2.1416584629440676
The first clinical application of high resolution image intensifiers with the input screen produced from evaporated cesium iodide in 1971 appears as one of the highlights of the continuous improvements of the facility.	1.8961369737553009
The fourth part of the article sketches the status of today and, considering the new methods using MRI, EBCT as well as CT, it predicts that the invasive coronary angiography will remain an indispensable method at least for the medium-term future.	2.134347651772621
Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole) have revolutionized the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention.	2.1372064511414326
These substances inhibit the H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of H2-receptor-antagonists.	1.954894167976441
The first proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has been introduced ten years ago.	2.289516679243328
Since then, sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated.	2.3675904374013155
Omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older.	2.2504009638793834
A new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients.	2.0591540841120204
The main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies.	2.1841803159830655
In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics.	2.5136684494791783
The recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0,7-1,4 mg/kg bodyweight and day.	2.486069199608314
However, some children with ulcerative esophagitis may need daily doses up to 3.5 mg/kg.	2.1168798925638526
Healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy.	2.3747938043579793
After remission, doses can often be reduced for maintenance therapy.	2.159181659317928
Side effects are rare and do not seem to increase with higher doses.	2.593402140483407
Possibly interactions with other medications, i.e.	2.294318861154585
antiepileptic drugs, may occur.	2.6814132319303727
A long-term therapy lasting more than 6 months in a child should be monitored by an experienced pediatric gastroenterologist.	2.385499720015895
Nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTI) are frequent complications after transurethral prostatectomy.	2.264552954902311
The resection itself, postoperative catheterization and the prostate are possible causes of these infections.	2.217928437458363
In this prospective study we investigated the influence of bacterial prostatic colonization on the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections and inflammatory complications.	2.5243154322103134
In 78 patients we observed in 42 cases (53,8%) a bacterial prostatitis.	2.1959448115434017
In 14 patients (17,9%) we found nosocomial UTI's and in 12 patients (15,4%) inflammatory complications.	2.3760436686669597
The incidence of postoperative UTI's increase significantly in patients with positive prostate-cultures.	2.659682112088176
On the other hand we only found corresponding prostate- and postoperative urine-cultures in less than 50%.	2.129565951337956
The presented data are not sufficient to conclude the kind of relevance of bacterial prostatic colonization for postoperative UTI's in transurethral prostatectomy.	2.0253233495155922
Under consideration of the significant increase of nosocomial UTI's in patients with positive prostate cultures a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be required in general.	2.603810157990455
Apnea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care.	2.0564758829654424
The prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment, however, are controversial.	2.4755635495603747
The universal aim, in order to prevent traumatization of the lung, is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible.	2.18663118898586
Therefore drugs such as theophylline, aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal CPAP have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit.	1.978945949989415
In these studies we developed a treatment algorithm.	2.485948203894159
In two clinically controlled studies performed successively we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline.	1.8100493061920326
As aminophylline has more side effects, sodium acetate theophylline is preferable.	2.3131517864566815
Bradycardia, apnea and desaturation were registered from the print-out of the monitoring system's trend analysis and in a polysomnographic study during steady-state conditions.	2.0435010285761592
In a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration.	2.317839203520814
We demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline; however, doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first 3 days of treatment.	2.25472165055084
In a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal CPAP as the third level of treatment.	2.4576323041454935
The rate of bradycardia, apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during CPAP and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved.	2.0021626587218977
The algorithm developed established theophylline with 5 mg/ kg as bolus infusion over 20 min, followed by 3 mg/kg BID as the first line of treatment.	2.2530711600930515
Only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice (indication >=4 bradycardias below 80/min, 4 desaturations below 80% or 2 apneas of >=20 s over 2 h).	1.8317324024765442
After 48 h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe >=3 apneas, 15 bradycardias or 15 desaturations over this period.	1.7657297641722591
Nasal CPAP was introduced as the third line of treatment.	2.339105699222989
With this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from 4.9 to 3.4 days (P<0.01).	2.0772096625574012
An evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi-institutional studies is indicated.	2.053516413689723
Background: Associations between back pain, the quality of sleep and the quality of matresses have not yet been investigated systematically.	2.7371604123945734
Methods: At check-out we asked 265 consecutive guests of a trade fair hotel about the subjective quality of sleep in the previous night.	1.88522409514482
Nine rooms had been equipped with new mattresses of three different qualities and prices, but this was kept blind to the hotel staff and the guests.	1.9459824791801439
Sleep quality was assessed on an analog scale between 1 (very good) and 5 (very bad) and was analyzed in comparison to the remaining 8-year old mattresses of the hotel, but also with respect to social (e.g.	2.3136736085023624
previous experience with low back and sleep complaints) characteristics of the guests.	2.368935647717672
Results: The three qualities of the mattresses correlated significantly and positively with the perceived quality of sleep, but the difference to the "old" mattresses was most pronounced for those guests who were staying overnight for professional reasons, or who frequently were suffering from low back pain or sleep disturbances.	1.8399698203496628
Conclusion: At least for chronic sufferers from back pain and sleep problems, the association between sleep quality and quality of the mattress is significant.	2.2901612948880246
Body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in-patient and out-patient settings, individually or in groups, alone or combined with other methods.	2.0298763880085624
These methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are restricted in their emotions, or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character.	2.0436969031396783
Short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays, reference is made to other procedures.	2.0405786735825377
The connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter alia and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological consequences are mentioned as active factors.	1.8688419184515659
In later development, the body and certain parts of the body acquire a symbolical meaning too, which is important for the therapy.	2.6246760151773576
The relationship of body oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy and especially to psychoanalysis shall also be discussed.	1.9651153224467297
Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.	2.343644999814969
Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases that occur in relation to cancer.	2.497506340166213
Supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune mechanism, specific antineuronal antibodies have sometimes been detected.	2.125681299451358
The current possibilities for treatment are limited.	2.5328176913057114
A female patient, aged 57, suffering from a breast cancer, developed a severe paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and limbic encephalitis within a few weeks.	2.173621046376185
It is possible that the impressive partial remission that occurred during the ensuing 6 months was not due to therapy.	2.032544028165597
Although the patient was still bound to a wheelchair, discharge from hospital was possible because she was still able to perform daily tasks by herself.	2.0311575328658242
The outcome in 163 patients treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the department for vascular and thoracic surgery since its institution 5 years ago is investigated.	2.038738364539186
Some 142 patients underwent operative aneurysm repair; 21 (13%) were excluded from operation.	2.1601854668479956
In 108 (66%) an elective procedure was performed, an emergency operation for rupture 34 times (21%).	2.09143944551993
In 16% of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted.	2.0334462953444503
For further analysis the patients were split in three groups: elective group 1, symptomatic group 2, ruptured group 3.	2.2233749634623106
Significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter, distribution of gender (128 M, 14 F), renal artery involvement, or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and the presence of multiple risk factors.	2.308236271747141
Group 1 had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2; whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group 3 than in the other two groups.	2.268637727165924
Sixty-four percent of patients had no, 11% had more than one complication.	2.3186611082507946
Mortality was 0 in groups 1 and 2, but 35.3% in group 3.	2.2962922730598216
The most frequent complication in groups 1 and 2 was pneumonia (13.9%) followed by cardiac complications (4.6%), and renal insufficiency (3.7%).	2.1749568326076814
In group 3 respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence (23.5%), followed by renal insufficiency (21%) and pneumonia (17.6%).	2.127027286913467
No patient of the nonoperated group suffered an aneurysm rupture; aneurysm diameters, except one, did not increase during the follow-up period.	2.043510953347663
Of the 130 operated and discharged patients 31 died; in no case was death related to the operative procedure.	2.1757664951382267
No important complications were observed during the follow-up of 37.2 +/- 17.9 months.	2.5554169486870033
Furthermore, the results are compared with those of the literature.	2.921105933902637
Based on their observations the authors conclude that this retrospective quality check was rather awkward and involved giving partly incomplete data for lack of a prospective evaluation.	1.8814623968629318
Nevertheless, the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory.	2.852610698563929
We report on a 32-year-old male patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who had severe candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract.	2.0486127218963572
After oral intake of fluconazole over 5 months itraconazole 200 mg/day was given for 1 month.	2.1842521996943227
However, fungal infection still persisted.	2.356402740336003
The antifungal activity of fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole against Candida albicans was evaluated by means of the microdilution test by determining the 90% inhibitory concentrations of each drugs.	2.0514668646385545
A high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was detected for fluconazole (50 µg/ml) revealing fluconazole resistance.	2.0196935128821356
The susceptibility to itraconazole was borderline (MIC 0.125 µg/ml) and that to ketoconazole was markedly lowered (MIC 0.25 µg/ml).	1.9949820701424068
Plasma levels of itraconazole were also found to be lowered.	2.8911495653982056
Therefore, the clinical resistance of Candida albicans to itraconazole can be explained by reduced susceptibility after azole therapy and also by the decreased absorption of the drug in HIV patients.	2.103861162666492
Patients suffering from soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may sometimes require vascular reconstruction to remove the tumor with adequate margins of clearance.	2.026579009380608
Besides this, recurrent lymph node metastases are often affixed to neighboring vessels.	2.220569472555775
MRI and angiography represent the adequate diagnostic procedures.	2.4378262570766944
Vessel-invasive sarcoma can hardly be treated by surgical resection with curative intent alone.	2.237504094046457
If there is doubt about invasion of arteries and veins, the vessels should be resected and replaced by autologous vein graft.	1.9621848607058994
Soft tissue coverage is of major importance, particularly if prosthetic grafts are used or the resection is within an area of irradiated tissue.	1.9615624208638665
After radical resection and combined modality therapy, one can expect local recurrence rates similar to those without vessel invasion.	2.08753670446772
To achieve this goal, surgical oncologists, vascular surgeons and plastic surgeons must work together.	1.973574373573964
Today, amputation can hardly be justified even in vessel-invasive soft tissue tumors.	2.1209735543545873
The study aimed to evaluate whether superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) is a useful tool in intensive care medicine to ventilate patients with pulmonary insufficiency.	2.419955811962524
Surgery on the lacrimal system in 296 children was performed at the Münster University Eye Hospital from 1987 to 1992.	2.0759936910955687
The dermatology clinic in Krefeld has treated a wide range of patients since its founding in 1845.	2.048247320779049
Nowadays the spectrum consists of allergology, occupational dermatology, phototherapy, dermatosurgery, phlebology and proctology as well as special clinics for andrology, sexually transmitted diseases and patients with HIV-infection.	2.007292551196951
Background: Dapiprazole hydrochloride is an alpha-1-adrenergic inhibitor that anticipates the mydriatic effect of phenylephrine in dilator muscle receptors in a competitive way.	1.8455503973654934
The aim of this study was to determine for which indications for mydriasis pupil dilation by phenylephrine alone is sufficient and if the reversal by dapiprazole is convenient and the practical.	1.7367363813324455
The Quality Assurance programmes of the social security insurance authorities are presented from the point of view of psychosomatic rehabilitation.	2.287206408963321
This presentation attempts to introduce aspects of both Quality Assurance and Quality Management into the field of medical rehabilitation.	2.076739027287602
The consequences of the programme for political order are emphasized.	2.1678038653284033
The special features of the individual programme objectives are elaborated.	2.7477546641236956
In addition, the importance of each of these objectives for psychosomatic rehabilitation is examined.	2.271158361503615
This field will inevitably have to adopt concepts of time and resource optimization.	2.107905181883458
For many years the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome has been on the top of medical articles about the intensive care patient.	2.212785244017938
Most of the published systems have been created by a panel of experts, giving to each dysfunction a number of points, usually 1 to 4, according to the severity.	2.360446309225655
Only 2 systems are different: the MODS of Marshall et al.	2.017176073977683
and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction LOD system of Le Gall et al., both published recently (1995 and 1996).	2.0203562086873386
They differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review (MDOS) or from a logistic regression (LOD), and secondly, because neither takes into account the therapy.	2.0648411325033913
Besides, the LOD system, when used on the 1st ICU day, has statistical qualities which are very promising.	2.0541980082658693
The LOD system is now used each consecutive day on septic patients in an European multicenter study.	1.9777521142325714
The relationsship between the growth of tumors and the expression of the protooncogen Bcl-2 could be shown in epithelial tumors.	2.403705904207532
A bcl-2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis.	2.4867995034239074
The potential meaning of bcl-2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown.	2.0176526146180978
The fact, that the heterogenous group of osteosarkoma is not sufficiently characterized at present, suggested to investigate the bcl-2 expression in osteosarcoma.	2.1664008135325514
Thus, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 47 specimens of different osteosarcomas of 36 patients.	2.2961052003548725
Sixteen cases (46 %) showed a strong expression of bcl-2 and 13 cases (35 %) were moderately positiv for bcl-2.	2.2791394517840975
Seven cases (19 %) were negative for bcl-2.	2.3967220752453375
The heterogenous, negative up to strong expression of bcl-2 yield clues, that the Bcl-2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics.	2.0536678393850876
Additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the monoklonal antibody MIB 1, directed against the Ki-67 epitop.	1.96841321040123
The data of bcl-2 expression and cellular proliferationrate lead to a classification correlating with the histological classification.	2.2903904291784882
To verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether Bcl-2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma, further investigations will be needed.	2.2704020487909937
During a period of two weeks in hot dry midsummer 3 patients presented in our pediatric outpatient clinic after a bath in a small lake.	2.062807404781999
They had an extremely itching, elevated exanthema mainly on their legs.	2.115345759665941
The single efflorescence had a diameter of about 1-3 cm.	2.5123880920191133
There were no signs of infection or fever.	2.423524503081564
Intussusception of the appendix vermiformis in adults is an uncommon event.	2.47261133959164
The combination of a mucinous cystadenoma with an intussuscepted appendix is extremely rare.	2.071419817455206
Clinical symptoms are nonspecific; in most cases the correct diagnosis is not made before surgical exploration.	2.4797030500923114
With the radiologic and endoscopic presentation of a polypoid lesion of the caecum, a neoplasm is often considered.	2.085471654539095
Endoscopic appendectomy or disinvagination by enema have been described.	2.20471628219028
Thus the definitive therapy is surgery and depends on the histological diagnosis.	2.6144620440029134
There are some case reports about excessive heat production in the absorbent canister when sevoflurane or enflurane are washed into a circle containing dried soda lime.	1.7527219237145257
This observation was often made in the DRÄGER ISO 8 circle system with the gas inlet upstream of the soda lime canister with the gas-flow from bottom to top.	1.8564393291767038
Abstract:  MR-imaging of the spinal column using Turbo-Spin-Echo-Sequences (TSE) often shows flow-void structures resembling intraspinal vessels.	1.822754039079639
Due to misinterpretation of those phenomenons invasive diagnostic procedures may be performed to diagnose an arteriovenous malformation (myelography, spinal angiography).	1.965083514702694
Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of spiral CT versus conventional CT in the preoperative assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies.	2.3043786760993688
Surgery is still the primary therapeutic approach in treatment of tumors in the head and neck area, dating back to the early nineteenth century.	2.400030637346306
More than 150 years ago, hemimaxillectomies and mandibular resections as well as hemiglossectomies were already performed by leading surgeons.	2.2677226611947345
The block principle we are now following dates back to Crile, who also established the principle of cervical lymph node dissection.	2.1843497762351602
Ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery, rendering radical surgical interventions possible without disfiguring patients.	1.8627976331978473
The development of facial reconstructive surgery proceeded in stages, in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps.	2.2312621133358865
The change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via arterialized skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer.	2.0522671064325793
Free bone grafting, inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting, has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites.	2.081540338499762
Although the five-year-survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past 30 years, distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded.	2.5550716704306975
This is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques.	2.194423049961268
The DÖSAK has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery.	2.040715586407768
Surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections.	1.9310838967172526
For this reason, midfacial degloving offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors, especially from an aesthetic point of view.	1.8683753810518144
Tumors situated deep behind the viscerocranium at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a transmandibular, transmaxillar, or transfacial approach with minimal morbidity.	1.7691459792688076
Concerning the concept of neck dissection, radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure.	2.3592669588653705
Actual inquiries concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in "No-neck" or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification.	1.8782721030812464
Laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years.	2.25686005560712
Due to its physical properties, the CO2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and ablating tissue.	2.0859031510345836
The high absorption of its wavelength in water (=10600 nm) is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue.	1.9022831902566961
Shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects, such as carbonization and coagulation.	2.562961123441396
This effect can be lessened with the SilkTouch scanner, since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating mirrors.	1.9446280923112107
This enables a controlled and reliable removal of various dermal lesions.	2.178532561619927
Particularly well-suited for treatment hypertrophic scars, post-acne scarring, perioral and periorbital wrinkles, rhinophymas and benign neoplasms including verruca vulgaris.	1.7616591352692856
Cosmetically favorable reepithelialization of the treated skin surfaces occurs within a very short time after treatment.	2.1372717201427966
Periorbital resurfacing and correction of a rhinophyma are used as examples of dermal treatment with the CO2 laser and the SilkTouch scanner.	2.1976580231407286
Acute spinal cord injury affects more than 3000 individuals per year with predominantly young people between 15 and 20 years of age being involved.	1.9498305147844033
Analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care.	2.292198983335184
Therefore, there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed.	2.1864164251740035
The first hours after the accident are decisive, because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later.	2.339547628500243
Besides the fate of the individual patient, the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care, long lasting rehabilitation, as well as post rehabilitative care.	2.6184059006698304
Chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons, expecially in hippocampus, by which the degree of damage differs in various species.	2.0065302490534362
Sapolski has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration, disturbed feed-back reaction, and hypersecretion of glucocorticoids.	2.041740211534251
The aim of this study was to investigate if the signal transmission via glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the brain of male wistar rats of two age groups (5-6 and 17-24 months, respectively) is changed in aging and which cytoplasmic factors/modulators participate in this process.	1.989370067505443
Introduction: The treatment of soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle region remains a challenge, because special anatomical and physiological properties have to be considered.	2.3073449966608623
Patients and methods: The data of 52 patients, who were treated between 1994 and 1998, were analyzed.	2.5099936839899377
48 % were posttraumatic defects and were located in the weight bearing zone in 37 %.	2.2883883034496297
Results: Fifty-nine procedures were used, including skin transplantation in 16 patients, local flaps in 3 cases, regional flaps in 14 cases, and microvascular procedures in 17 cases.	2.108615685749352
The overall success rate was 92 %.	2.4600830036700954
Complications occurred in 18 patients.	2.551149666467316
Conclusions: Using these data and evaluation of the actual literature lead to the development of an algorithm for the treatment of defects in this area.	2.934972804936778
The modern armamentarium of plastic surgery offers the possible different treatment modalities.	2.178001149741513
The conventional multichannel electroencephalogram is quite inconvenient for long-term monitoring in the operating theatre or intensive care unit.	2.2597948535727324
Recording of the EEG would be easier if a small number of channels was sufficient.	2.201137549674747
Aiming at reduction of channels, leads from different regions of the scalp were analysed visually and with regard to their spectral content.	2.2333702581958454
APC resistance was first discovered in 1993.	2.4891077480764845
It is the most frequent cause of thrombophilia in Europe and North America.	2.4752275675531714
In more than 90% of cases, the underlying cause of APC resistance is a single point mutation in the factor V gene.	2.3631512710540723
Heterozygous patients have a between five- and ten-fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis, while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50- and 100-fold.	2.209350384055712
Where there is a previous history of thrombosis, a careful investigation of the coagulation system, in particular a determination of the APC ratio, is recommended prior to surgery.	2.5088428638274145
In patients with APC resistance, a body-weight-specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended.	2.0990903833957204
Heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present, while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time.	1.9212630164646125
Primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications.	2.2388409010762946
Pyomyositis is an acute bacterial infection with abscess formation in the skeletal muscles mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus.	2.1204648678317324
The disease is found more often in males.	2.4233309464424
Since the patients symptoms and the clinical and laboratory findings are relatively unspecific, the clinical diagnosis of pyomyositis can present difficulties.	2.636470187167161
Furthermore, cases of pyomyositis are rare in non-tropical countries and some physicians may not be familiar with it.	2.2800566076698554
If not diagnosed and treated properly, pyomyositis can lead to sepsis and death.	2.256628536005933
Although the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been clarified, some predisposing factors of forensic interest are well known: (trivial) trauma or vigorous exercise of the affected skeletal muscles, small potentially "septic" foci in other tissues or internal organs and a preexisting immunodeficiency, e. g. in diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug abusers or individuals suffering from HIV.	2.0223524226635363
Three cases of "non-tropical" pyomyositis with fatal outcome are presented and the literature on the subject is reviewed with special reference to epidemiological and etiological factors, taking forensic aspects, histomorphologic findings and the problems of post-mortem diagnosis of pyomyositis into consideration.	2.2061908733038726
Aim of the study: The etiology of persistent crying during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated.	2.1127658274815353
Based upon recent data from the "Munich Interdisciplinary Research and Intervention Program (MIRIP)", this paper shall discuss and challenge well known explanatory models.	1.849404883670872
In addition, novel approaches of intervention shall be presented.	2.0556651437836644
Because tumour cell invasion is a three-dimensional process involving tumour cells as well as stromal cells, tumour invasion models should include equivalents of both compartments in a spatially defined organisation.	2.188123632615261
Aims: Evaluation of differentiation and invasive potential in relation to basement membrane (BM) formation of new human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines under the influence of fibromatosis fibroblasts in a 3D co-culture system (collagen type I/fibroblast-containing matrix).	1.891719747722209
Material and methods: OSCC cell lines were established and cultured on collagen type I matrix with and without the inclusion of fibro-/myofibroblasts derived from nodular palmar fibromatosis).	1.8714342910505266
Evaluation of invasion was done by conventional H & E staining after paraffin embedding; immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratins (MNF 116), involucrin (Sy5), vimentin (V9), collagen type IV (CIV22), laminin (1-chain, 4C7), and Ki-67 (MIB1); and electron microscopy followed.	1.8556979025076012
Results: The OSCC cell lines PE/CA-PJ15, PE/CA-PJ34, PE/CA-PJ41 were invasive exclusively on gels containing fibroblasts with stratification of the multilayerd OSCC cell coat and polarised expression of cytokeratin and involucrin.	1.611704832351224
There was no evidence for BM, either by immunohistochemistry or by electron microscopy, although OSCC are immunohistochemically positive for collagen type IV and laminin in the 2D cell culture.	1.871407955157776
There were no differences in proliferative activity of the gels with and without fibroblasts.	2.2459137825498954
The absence of a BM does not, per se, imply an invasive tumour growth.	2.0716154904755637
Moreover, stratification and terminanl differentiation of epithelial tumour cells occur independently of a structural BM.	1.926399837022729
Interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing.	2.622037160011573
Limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability.	2.3909352140132065
Although larger movements still promote callus formation, the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered.	2.3899100123117547
Fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large.	2.3760982003039253
A combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non-union.	2.761593037494295
Therefore, having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach, one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis.	2.174159260736839
Dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap, stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process.	2.063496272861853
External mechanical stimulation, however, has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load-bearing patients.	2.5346570616282817
Although ketamine has been in clinical use for 3 decades, the neuropharmacological basis of its analgesic, anaesthetic, sympathomimetic, and psychotomimetic effects is still a subject of controversial discussion and intensive investigational efforts.	1.9660252004723726
In recent years, however, new experimental approaches to its effects on the cellular and molecular level and the availability of pure ketamine enantiomers contributed substantially to the understanding of its complex neuropharmacology.	2.2041550935651597
This article reviews the current knowledge of ketamine effects on ligand-operated and voltage-operated transmembrane ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors, transmitter uptake, and the NO-cGMP system in neurons.	1.892705605955087
With regard to its potential clinical relevance and supposed relative role among the complex mechanisms involved in pain perception, analgesia, anaesthesia, and psychotomimesis, the contributions of recent experimental and clinical findings to the identification of major target sites of ketamine are summarised.	1.9377753597458258
In contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the potential role of opioid receptors, there is now considerable evidence that NMDA antagonism is a central mechanism that contributes to the amnesic, analgesic, anaesthetic, and psychotomimetic as well as the neuroprotective actions of ketamine.	2.0280930314824848
Moreover, the involvement of non-NMDA glutamate receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic transmission, interactions with 5-HT receptors, and L-Type Ca2+ channels may account for some of its anaesthetic and neuroprotective properties.	1.9027216996809635
There is undoubtedly a need for a safe disinfection method of optical instruments used by ENT specialists.	2.1993911337193564
So far, a standard method that sufficiently covers the risk of infection for patients and medical staff alike while serving the need of practicability in daily routine has not been established.	2.301181806274939
Therefore, in the ENT departments of the hospitals of Mannheim, Kaiserslautern, and Tübingen, studies on the disinfection of rigid optical instruments without working channel were performed between February 1999 and May 1999.	1.9192395030284086
Instruments were wiped either with an aldehyde or alcohol (ethanol 80%) and germs were detected by quantitative swab cultures.	1.9042773583207258
As discussed in the article, disinfection with ethanol proved to be at least equally efficient if not better than disinfection with aldehyde.	2.071149116734947
Therefore, it fully serves the requirements of a safe method for disinfection optical instruments without working channels.	2.019366417491744
White piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals, caused by the widespread Trichosporon fungi.	2.516742473381591
The infection is characterized clinically by whitish, soft and easily removable coating of the hair shafts; however, the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points.	1.8944386290463144
While all body hair may be affected, the pubic hair is most frequently affected.	2.173917587406306
This paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34-year-old Central European man.	2.322012524508569
Only 2 men, aged 42 and 53 years, do not fall in this range.	2.008028857268721
Recently, a major African study disclosed this disease in women for the first time.	2.1514836098330137
In moderate latitudes, however, this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men.	2.363572765315235
In open fractures the rate of infected non-union defects has in recent years decreased due to the increased primary application of external fixation.	2.6232678149208657
In spite of this positive state of affairs the condition is still encountered often enough to warrant specific treatment strategies and techniques.	1.8619769141408629
In the treatment of infected pseudarthroses the general principles of osteitis treatment are applied.	2.345345777384119
This includes radical excision of infected pseudarthrotic bone and of the diseased surrounding soft tissue, provides mechanical stability in the non-union area and requires effective local treatment of the infection in combination with systemic, target-specific and temporary well-defined antibiotic therapy as well as procedures to improve local circulation.	2.35959140562898
The incorporation of autogenous bone transplants in defects appears to depend on close contact between the transplant and the vascularized receiving site and on the quantity of the transplanted osseous material.	2.018073113284091
A promising alternative method of dealing with extensive bone defects is osteogenesis produced by callus distraction; therefore special attention is given to Ilizarov's ring fixation system.	1.8683351314457892
Aim of the study: Using phantom studies, a dedicated low-field MR system with 0.2 T and a whole-body MR-scanner with 1.0 T were compared.	1.9412743280622091
Many different mechanisms contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the so-called diabetic foot syndrome.	2.492426595787873
Among chronic complications, the diabetic foot syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization.	2.4089019888508445
The relative risk of diabetic patients requiring an amputation is up to 45 times greater than in normal subjects.	1.9350710903553467
Sensory neuropathy, ischemia, and infection are the principal pathogenetic factors in the diabetic foot syndrome.	2.1187690411994002
In most cases, a painless trauma is the initial condition that leads to an ulcer.	2.18412853751208
In this article, an overview of the different causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment options for a multidisciplinary team are discussed.	2.2561944347941094
Lung resection offers the best prospect of long-term survival in patients with nonmetastatic pulmonary neoplasia.	2.7167046930557657
In view of the dismal prognosis of unresected bronchial cancer, surgical resection should be encouraged even in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function.	2.3674275313367588
Accurate estimation of the postoperative cardiopulmonary function is therefore desirable to avoid (a) refusal of potentially curative treatment and (b) severe postoperative disability.	2.0775672010636104
The origins of postresection morbidity and mortality are multifactorial.	2.597190009598607
Thus, no single pulmonary function test or hemodynamic measurement can accurately and reliably predict postoperative cardiorespiratory complications.	1.8716889303578679
Criteria of functional operability should be based on percent of predicted value, so that patient's age, sex, and height will be taken into consideration.	2.1106130847346654
Exercise testing offers the advantage that both pulmonary and cardiac risk can be evaluated simultaneously.	2.2076639346010527
The high predictive value of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in assessing postoperative morbidity and mortality is established.	2.354775527977507
The calculation of predicted postoperative lung function (ppo) is of importance.	2.1731891206090337
The postoperative values for the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1-ppo), the transfer factor (TL,CO-ppo), and VO2max-ppo can be predicted by using the same formula.	2.274563136661187
Patients with nearly normal lung function (FEV1, TL,CO > 75 % predicted) and no concomitant cardiac disease can undergo lung resection right up to pneumonectomy without further diagnostic procedures.	1.856808663384343
In the others, FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo should be estimated first by taking into account the number of segments to be resected.	2.0793121458217305
Patients with values < 30 % predicted are usually regarded as being inoperable, whereas values > 40 % predicted qualify for resection without the need for further diagnostics.	1.9711660040364252
VO2max < 10 ml/kg/min or < 40 % predicted are prohibitive for surgery.	2.223210752939574
If VO2max is > 20 ml/kg/min or > 75 % predicted, functional operability without limitation is given.	2.063980586193793
For those cases where diagnostic uncertainty still remains, FEV1-ppo, TL,CO-ppo, and VO2max-ppo can be calculated by means of quantitative lung scans.	2.013178642587615
Patients with either FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo < 30 % predicted or VO2max-ppo < 8 ml/kg/min or < 35 % predicted are deemed inoperable.	1.7985087261943833
The treatment of acute of Achilles tendon rupture experienced a dynamic development in the last ten years.	2.2366999342908422
Decisive for this development was the application of MRI and above all the ultrasonography in the diagnostics of the pathological changes and injuries of tendons.	2.3092051371913023
The question of ruptue morphology as well as different courses of healing could be now evaluated objectively.	2.238248160222375
These advances led consequently to new modalities in treatment concepts and rehabilitation protocols.	2.0943577126806865
The decisive input for improvements of the outcome results and particularly the shortening of the rehabilitation period came with introduction of the early functional treatment in contrast to immobilizing plaster treatment.	2.21400142065461
In a prospective randomized study (1987-1989) at the Trauma Dept.	2.253641953365194
of the Hannover Medical School could show no statistical differences comparing functional non-operative with functional operative therapy with a special therapy boot (Variostabil/Adidas).	1.9416571167230186
The crucial criteria for therapy selection results from the sonografically measured position of the tendon stumps in plantar flexion (20  °).	2.210501977849544
With complete adaptation of the tendons' ends surgical treatment does not achieve better results than non-operative functional treatment in term of tendon healing and functional outcome.	1.9597867923267118
Regarding the current therapeutic standards each method has is advantages and disadvantages.	2.2094296300805785
Both, the operative and non-operative functional treatment enable a stable tendon healing with a low risk of rerupture (1-2 %).	2.487708364372796
Meanwhile there is consensus for early functional aftertreatment of the operated Achilles' tendons.	2.0862291607413184
There seems to be a trend towards non-operative functional treatment in cases of adaquate sonografical findings, or to minimal invasive surgical techniques.	2.5487946636429673
Based on a case report, we offer brief guidelines on the perioperative management of patients with Sleep-Apnea-Syndrome (SAS) who present with a high incidence of a difficult airway and a high risk of respiratory depression during the perioperative period.	2.3624839421423065
A 39 year old male patient with a body mass index of 34,22 kg/m2 and receiving continuous-positive-airway-pressure- (CPAP) therapy for known SAS was scheduled for elective plastic surgery.	2.0040352665689345
After induction of anaesthesia and direct laryngoscopy no adequate airway could be established and the patient became hypoxic, hypercapnic and developed hypotension and bradycardia.	2.1301741399536334
With the use of a laryngeal mask airway the patient was stabilized and did not show neurologic sequale after immediate awakening.	2.6061185095087356
The following fiberoptic intubation of the awake patient, still showing tendency of upper airway obstruction, confirmed the difficult anatomical structures.	1.9834198342369875
The subsequent general anesthesia was uneventful.	2.453237863291151
The patient received CPAP therapy and was monitored during the first postoperative night in the Intensive Care Unit.	2.1824054938722464
He made an uneventful recovery.	2.5391647112880897
He was advised to have regional anaesthesia or planned fiberoptic intubation, where possible, in the case of further anesthetic intervention.	2.270603528508189
SAS has major implications for the anaesthesiologist and whenever patients exhibiting the high risk factors (obesity, male sex, history of intense snoring, impaired daytime performance, nonrefreshing daytime naps) are presented for surgery this condition should be considered.	1.9412591834606971
Elective surgery should be postponed until after adequate examination and treatment when necessary.	2.3197386153245088
Patients with SAS should always be suspected of having cardiopulmonary dysfunctions such as hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia or cor pulmonale.	1.9088209380774757
It is most important to avoid sedative premedication, to initiate CPAP therapy preoperatively, to encourage regional anaesthesia if possible and to ensure close monitoring over the complete perioperative period.	1.8759667708959717
Planned fiberoptic intubation, preferably with surgical personnel available for an emergency airway, is a safe method for the induction of anaesthesia.	2.4594747411270226
Postoperatively, patients are at high risk from respiratory depression, even in the awake state.	2.8000790203253807
Postoperative opioid analgesia, no matter what route, should only be given under close monitoring.	2.1558828482504144
Independently of regional or general anaesthesia there is an increased risk of respiratory depression in the middle of the first postoperative week, suspected to be caused by the catching up on lost REM-sleep, due to shifts in the normal sleep pattern during the first postoperative days.	2.4867380639072962
Life style measures (weight reduction and control, reduction of total fat calories to <30% of total calories, modification of fat intake to increased monounsaturated vegetable fat, increased intake of dietary fibers, increased physical activity, controlled stress relaxation) are the basis of longterm therapy of coronary heart disease.	1.9501422534759112
For transformation to daily life both patient and doctor need motivation, information, patience, and realistic aimes.	1.9251208785121154
For realization the 10 rules of medical information should be followed.	2.289269697080438
The patient must be informed that the "new lifestyle" is not punishing but means a new quality of life.	1.9876903299287811
With respect to the most important metabolic syndrome with hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance, weight reduction is the most important measure for preventing complications of atherosclerosis.	2.401388781547287
The patient should use a diary for weight control and blood pressure selfmeasurement.	2.1292035763206094
IOL implantation in childhood is still controversial.	2.6461816440105945
Background: Increases in serum calcium are often detected by chance.	2.200549794991744
They warrant a prompt diagnostic work-up to identify the underlying cause.	2.661687965491873
In the present review we describe our experience with debridement in necrotizing pancreatitis, with particular emphasis on the indications for surgery and the outcome in patients with infected and sterile necrosis.	2.446716512579092
Within 7 years 64 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis underwent surgery with a median preoperative APACHE II score of 9.	2.1859844607497725
The indications for surgery were either proven infection or persistence of symptoms.	2.261923759921528
Thirty-six patients were found to have infected necrosis, while 28 patients had sterile necrosis.	2.257367667592727
There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding pre- and postoperative parameters.	2.348344910421349
The surgical technique involved a blunt necrosectomy followed by closed packing with Penrose drains.	1.8975504321613552
This technique produced the lowest reported mortality of 6.2 % with a reoperation rate of only 17 %, demonstrating that even with sterile necrosis surgical management can be carried out safely.	1.9657387960145019
The incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) is proportional to the incidence of myocardial ischaemic episodes.	2.389270538502615
Therefore, the prevention of such episodes is of great clinical importance.	2.4448865592315503
The absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid is a major problem in transurethral prostatic surgery (TUR-P).	2.090028925293297
Various indicators have been tested to monitor fluid absorption with regard to continuous registration and sufficient accuracy.	2.286286604783884
The volumetric fluid balance is not suitable as a routine method because of its inaccuracy.	2.385402944754528
Easily accessible parameters are unspecific because of surgical bleeding (haematocrit [Hct]), or are interfered with by physiological counter-regulatory actions (serum sodium [Na] concentration).	1.7473149851016303
In 1986 Hulten et al.	2.3569711126427944
suggested adding 2% ethanol to the irrigation fluid as a marker and investigated it intermittently in the expired air with an alcohol-test appliance.	1.9474577540065905
In a prospective clinical study of 17 patients undergoing TUR-P under spinal anaesthesia, expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid (2% ethanol in Purisole, Fresenius, Bad Homburg) were monitored.	1.879685310685558
Gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified diverting anaesthetic gas monitor (Normac, Datex, Helsinki) that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use.	1.9579225998258643
In addition, at intervals of 10 minutes we measured blood alcohol, endtidal alcohol (Alcotest 7110, Drauml;ger, Lübeck), haematocrit, serum Na concentration, and blood gases.	1.7916545408546662
Sixty-eight measurements were obtained from the 17 patients.	2.438016163656966
As shown in other studies, serum Na (r2 = 0.68) and Hct (r2 = 0.39) correlated poorly with the irrigation fluid as determined by serum alcohol levels.	1.8763797671708768
In contrast, the expiratory alcohol measurements with the alcotest 7110 (r2 = 0.93) and Normac devices (r2 = 0.85) were closely related.	1.7686606206697646
Continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a Normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentrations, and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during TUR-P.	1.926190333044069
Between 1986 and 1996, 21 patients had a tibiocalcanear arthrodesis.	2.610760498476238
Indications for surgery were in all cases either osteomyelitis or avascular necrosis of the talus.	2.5093573864154908
External stabilisation was used in 17 patients due to severe soft tissue damage or extensive infection of the talus, internal screw fixation was used in four patients.	2.670907378288796
There were eight complications in seven patients, one patient had a below the knee amputation.	2.352982931382998
The leg length discrepancies after resection of the talus was equalised in four cases with callus distraction using an Ilisarov ring fixator.	2.455269209222993
Follow up evaluation was available in 18 patients after an average of 38 months (12-86 mo.).	2.231291525600242
There were no infectious recurrenies during the follow up period and a solid fusion was achieved in all patients that were followed.	2.5421203958629626
According to a modified Kitaoka score, results were excellent and good in 12 of the 18patients.	2.347106175461973
External stabilisation, especially the Ilisarov ring fixator is the primary method of treatment in cases with severe infection or soft tissue damage.	2.6141468289016117
Intraoperative autotransfusion (MAT), preoperative autologous blood donation, and preoperative normovolaemic haemodilution are three different methods to avoid homologous blood transfusion during surgical procedures.	1.8466825406042524
The controversial use of MAT via cell saver in tumour surgery as well as contamination of the operative field with urine illustrate the particular difficulties of autologous blood transfusion in connection with radical prostatectomy.	2.205927953100875
We investigated changes in the osmotic resistance of the retransfused red blood cells (RBC), bacterial contamination, changes in coagulation parameters, and the presence of tumour cells.	2.456452569626748
Between 1995 and 1998, 12 patients with pseudotumor orbitae were treated in the ENT Department of the University of Saarland.	2.5241922357817206
Histopathological examination showed granulomatous type of pseudotumor in six, lymphoid in three, and sclerosing in three patients.	2.014939717240314
In seven cases the pseudotumor orbitae were medially located and in four cases laterally.	2.034575722672355
In one patient nearly all orbital structures were infiltrated.	2.126439286063445
A number of different mapping systems have been published for the lymph-node staging in lung cancer.	2.413398765875978
The use of a reproducible map is an essential prerequisite for correct determination of the TNM status and comparing the surgical results.	2.2934053047360496
In order to evaluate the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymph-node dissection in Germany, we performed a mail survey involving 90 hospitals performing operations for lung cancer.	2.193203285210416
Responses were obtained from 61 (67.7 %) hospitals.	2.323466642220759
Currently, the majority of the departments (43 %) use the German staging system (according to the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Thorax-, Herz- und Gefäßchirurgie/Pneumologie), 23 % lymph-node mapping according to Naruke, and 25 % an individual description of the resected lymph nodes.	2.0833679015873576
Mediastinal lymph-node sampling guided by the intraoperative aspect of lymph nodes is performed in 59 % of the departments.	2.499323509101792
A systematic mediastinal "en-bloc" resection is accomplished in 41 %.	2.1259894706486473
The results of this survey represent the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymphadenectomy in lung cancer in Germany and might be useful for the development of a uniform staging system.	2.253361767393123
In a 4-year period two right-sided empyemas occurred following a total of 39 pneumonectomies for lung cancer.	2.484644352360266
In another case pneumonectomy was performed for left-sided lung cancer with concomitant empyema as an emergency procedure in a patient referred from an outside hospital.	2.1686097970223384
Empyema was treated with repeated thoracoscopic debridements and intermittent lavage with polyvinylpyrrolidine-iodine solution and streptocinase/streptodornase.	1.9547811934833692
Three to seven thoracoscopies were required to sterilize the pleural cavity.	2.0565159263214765
After a median follow-up of 14 months all three patients are well and without any evidence of infection.	2.326609356128592
VATS is suitable for definitive treatment of postpneumonectomy empyema and is associated with excellent functional and cosmetic results.	2.377700425109861
Injuries to the spine and the spinal cord are an important problem.	2.674219581582588
In the present paper the application of external transpedicular fixation of the spinal column for surgical treatment of patients in the acute phase of spinal cord injuries is described.	2.8265235321435283
The results of treatment obtained in 54 patients in the acute phase are presented.	2.412666538533823
Decompression of the spinal cord can be accomplished by way of a dorsal approach.	2.452764535365511
In this way it is possible to remove the compressing factor in stages.	2.391747114414587
Positive results were achieved in the late phase in 84.22% of patients with acute spinal and spinal cord injuries.	2.6723640966865823
Objectives: Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) show retarded growth.	1.9589239536644745
The question arose as to whether proportionate catch-up growth follows.	2.1358739785252436
Background: The fundus autofluorescence imaging technique has been modified allowing improved image resolution (768 x 572 pixel).	1.8216233711846315
We present results of fundus autofluorescence studies using this technique.	2.14356532351174
Certain intra-articular fractures of the knee can be managed by arthroscopically assisted reduction and  fixation.	2.5179238836979776
The known benefits of arthroscopy include better visualization of the entire joint, limited dissection, and thorough irrigation.	2.125830709521766
The purpose of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of certain intra-articular fractures of the knee.	2.2353927641502462
From May 1995 to November 1997, 34 patients with intra-articular fractures of the knee were treated by arthroscopic reduction and fixation.	2.449137717396269
We treated 11 patients with tibial plateau fracture type I, II and III (according to J. Schatzker classification), 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (intercondylar eminence) type II, III and IV (according to Meyers, McKeever and Zariczny classification), two patients with completely dislocated osteochondral flake fractures of the femoral condyle, and one patient with a minimally displaced fracture of the patella.	2.2637496641884143
Postoperatively they were all allowed passive motion exercises.	2.2718498575138195
Patients with avulsion fractures of the ACL and the patient with fracture of the patella were allowed immediate weight bearing, while patients with tibial plateau fractures and osteochondral fractures were allowed weight bearing only after 12 weeks.	2.3215020105321367
Results: Of the 11 tibial plateau fractures, 8 were anatomically reduced, and in 2 the dislocation was less than 2 mm.	2.416291786020572
No further dislocation of the fragment followed.	2.82040796035721
All patients but one reported stable knees and they all had a full range of motion at follow-up.	2.0971969433845956
Of the 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament, 19 were anatomically reduced.	2.422971622808363
Except in one patient, functional results were excellent (KT1000 was 1.3 mm, average loss of flexion was 2.5 °, loss of extension was 1.3 °).	2.0463292128911243
In two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle, reduction was anatomical.	2.664046446898229
The fractures healed, the patients were free of pain and had full ROM at the follow-up.	2.5644421686417918
The fracture of the patella healed in 4 weeks with full ROM of the knee.	2.4446035282556178
There was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications.	2.3291370155431736
Conclusions: Arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra-articular fractures of the knee.	2.349741129250664
Provided indications are good, results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy.	2.140250828582869
There is less postoperative morbidity, and hospitalization and total rehabilitation times are shorter.	2.151129118899454
Some technical hints are presented.	2.5177974096419224
A healthy 38-year-old woman suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days after a vaginal hysterectomy.	2.3443313713182525
Although standard cardiac life support (CPR) was instituted immediately after the event, it was not possible to re-establish a spontaneous circulation for about 40 min.	2.179557259489249
Systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with slow injection of 1.5 million IU urokinase was performed as a final life-maintaining measure because of the high probability that the underlying cause was a pulmonary embolus; 10 min later (after 60 min of ongoing CPR) the patient regained a stable circulation.	2.0504095624406338
She survived without neurological deficit in spite of the long duration of CPR.	2.5942445733097133
In 348 patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between 1985 and 1994 we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection, its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging.	2.7354228227261723
The same histopathological work-up was carried out in all cases.	2.9545549040589476
Whether resections or extirpations were performed, the number of dissected lymph nodes increased from 5.3 and (1985/1986) to 16.7 and 17.3 (1991/1992) and to 15.8 and 17.3 (1993/1994) respectively.	1.9541650458504536
Neither the type of operation nor the surgeon's experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected.	2.5142984067136185
The increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation, the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk.	2.7432783951631783
We found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases (P = 0.02) and between an increase in UICC stage III (P = 0.005) and pN2 tumors (P = 0.000) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected.	2.515630114962359
Central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases.	2.5925012601203536
With the institution of the Protection against infection Act, case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of notifiable infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in Germany for the first time.	1.7670283009079464
Case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease.	2.3856599409145964
The abstraction thereby required leads to the creation of nosological entities.	2.203168458001284
The case definitions, which were developed by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to the Protection against infection Act, enable the local health departments to assess and categorise reported cases, deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the RKI via the state health institutions.The quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved, as each reported case/infection will fulfil defined criteria, thereby enabling unclear cases/diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed.	1.7240134578111959
Furthermore, implants offer good chances for prosthetic rehabilitation in the insufficient bone site, if the extremely atrophic jaw is to be reconstructed by grafting procedures with avascular and vascular grafts, by guided bone regeneration, by distraction osteogenesis, by bone substitutes and in the future by osteoinductive proteins in order to prepare the conditions for implant insertion.	2.032991552935488
Those reconstruction procedures combined with implants become often necessary, if  complicated hard and soft tissue defects of the skull have to be reconstructed to create the prerequisites for the stabilisation of epitheses or to insert implant-supported devices.	2.117151409623919
A 58-year-old woman was initially externally diagnosed in 1983 with a presacral mass, which was subsequently treated as an abcess.	2.2339377311672033
Thereafter, the patient experienced recurrent perianal fistulas.	2.884465945304062
Further diagnostic studies revealed a cystic tumor, considered to be an epidermoid cyst, which was located in the inferior pelvis and was consequently removed.	2.5396903642732225
Histologically, cystic scar tissue was found with a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma which measured 4 cm.	2.1749891752991677
Later on, the patient again experienced perianal fistulas originating from a renewed presacral mass.	2.311517317736763
As a result, an abdominal-perianal rectum extirpation and a partial resection of the sacrum with placement of a descendostomy were done.	2.0542131917407187
One year following her operation, the patient is free from any complaints and relapses.	2.5456440234443947
The tail-gut cyst is a very rare entity which arises from the inadequate involution of the tail-gut during embryonal development.	1.9653870510347664
A malignant transformation occurs in 10 % of the cases.	2.6983977199440514
In the case of recurrent perianal fistulas and cystic masses between the rectum and os sacrum or os coccygeum, a tail-gut cyst should be taken into consideration, the goal being its complete removal.	1.8744130046119594
The German Social Law has required quality assurance (QA) procedures since 1989.	1.911498931603317
The measures must be suitable to allow "comparing investigations".	2.30006561304406
In 1992 the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine published recommendations for QA in anaesthesia: most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner, and thus, a list of 63 pitfalls, events, and complications (PECs) and five degrees of severity were defined.	1.898833139131099
The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of PECs in anaesthesia and to correlate PECs with procedures and preoperative health status.	2.1798747496167286
Using the diary method, the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed.	2.0600242301852325
Positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood.	2.2337802625608054
Duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities.	2.221211848818966
A total of 55 elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least 50 days.	2.0359262738262704
The data were analyzed interindividually (using regression analyses) and intraindividually (using time series analyses).	1.8725366137606978
While positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter- and intraindividual perspective, there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective.	2.2027320722593613
Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.	2.9670210334419775
Purpose: Regional hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.	2.2113962123593733
The purpose of the project is the optimization of the therapy using non-invasive, three-dimensional imaging of tissue changes or of the temperature distribution during regional hyperthermia.	2.237481846578778
In order to reach this goal, the law regulates the essential reqirements for the adequate collection of blood and blood constituents, as well for safe usage of blood products.	2.087985906902648
Moreover it lays down rules for look-back procedures, prescribes the collection of data on the epidemiology in donor populations, creates a legal basis for the advisory group 'Arbeitskreis Blut', and fosters the self sufficiency with blood and plasma by several prescriptions.	1.7262864244159137
In the last decades back pain has reached dramatic proportions in industrialized countries.	2.0264437479736856
Disorders of the back are nowadays the leading cause of direct and indirect health care costs.	1.9972791459585293
Accurate prevalence estimates are needed to serve as a basis for health care evaluations.	2.583082409321239
A review of epidemiologic studies in the general population reveals that back pain has reached a prevalence of 40 % for current pain.	2.0615189394564926
7 to 18 % are "frequently", "often", "daily" or "constantly" affected.	2.2089738668706818
75 % of the adult population suffers from back pain during the last year.	2.622689046909092
80 to 90 % of the adult population in industrialized countries experience back pain ever.	2.459381130186901
Gender specific differences are only present in severe, chronic forms which are more often experienced by women.	2.1111750549409516
Back pain has a prevalence maximum at 50 to 64 years.	2.177132156336635
Older persons display lower prevalence estimates.	2.399011857225666
The prevalence maximum in men is one decade earlier than in women.	2.0934070650265992
There are several potential explanations for this prevalence pattern that are discussed in the article.	2.1944236818337273
Back pain can be classified by location, temporal characteristics, pain intensity and pain history.	2.182512054297908
Currently, for none of these dimensions generally accepted, uniformly employed and validated definitions are available.	2.007744311167663
In most of the industrialized countries back pain is one of the most expensive symptoms.	2.611333964289931
75-90 % of the direct and indirect health care costs were caused by those 5-10 % of patients who are disabled.	2.601822960951743
As predictors of back pain a history of back pain and job satisfaction play by far a more important role than the extensively studied mechanical factors.	2.090083047506401
For a first episode of back pain the prognosis is favorable.	2.4049591983455465
If the pain persist for more than three months the prognosis is unfavorable.	2.434489234971936
After six months of absenteeism because of back pain more than half of the afflicted never return to work.	2.2961471439291956
Rarely back pain is present as a single symptom.	2.6578740788558766
In more than 80 % back pain is associated with pain in at least one joint.	2.854170346662194
It remains to be studied if back pain may be viewed as an entity or as part of a more complex pain syndrome.	2.25663448168849
Chronic low back pain can be considered to be one of the most frequently treated and most costly diseases in modern industrial societies.	2.52581863101303
Dysfunctions and imbalances of the spine-supporting muscles increase the risk of low back pain.	2.577522705915008
Consequently preventive treatment and rehabilitation have to aim at preserving and restoring the full capacity of the spine-supporting muscles as well as training coordination and spine-friendly behaviour.	2.1268495855197234
In addition to various measures of pain therapy, physiotherapeutic treatment including neuro-physiotherapy, physical treatment (eg electrotherapy), balneotherapy and supportive behavioural training, medical rehabilitation therapy (MRT) ranks among the most effective ways of treating low back pain.	1.8703267391714542
MRT applies guidelines and methods of exercise methodology within medically indicated programmes of preventive treatment and rehabilitation.	1.9776122842600365
Various objectives of MRT are outlined with special regard to the stages of MRT treatment, emphasizing positive adaptation of the neuro-muscular system in the course of rehabilitation.	2.1647246615917943
Physicians are responsible for MRT diagnosis and control.	2.581837303924851
Taking into account the base disorder and the progress of therapy physiotherapists and the physicians in charge determine MRT objectives and treatment strategies.	2.0226277556292933
A 39-year-old female patient presented with an intense allergic reaction and shock after ingesting sunflower seeds and simultaneously acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).	2.0303373556222426
Skin tests and CAP specific.	2.5259175679931407
IgE demonstrated an IgE-mediated sensibilization to sunflower seeds.	2.189731995964063
When sunflower seeds were eaten alone, only discrete paresthesias of the oral mucosa occurred.	2.1645698492928886
Surprisingly, an oral challenge with ASA was well tolerated.	2.3259140876951605
The supplementary centribution of ASA to the allergic reaction was done-dependent.	2.109881968443376
The quantity of the allergen also modified the intensity of the symptoms.	2.320564491469872
This surprising effect of ASA may be attributed to increased gastric resorption of the allergens.	2.136340518479718
During the course of this reaction, eosinophil-cationic-protein was released.	2.207283743617987
Axillary lymph node dissection for node sampling is one of the most important staging procedures when mammary carcinoma is treated surgically.	2.3854113334246483
Periprosthetic femoral fractures present the problem of fracture treatment and prosthetic stability.	2.4021271919588045
Various treatment options are recommended for managing these fractures.	2.4585132495177398
We treated 51 patients with 54 periprosthetic fractures between 1985 and 1995.	2.1113801329226862
Of these, 42 (78 %) fractures were treated with a plate, eight (14 %), with a revision prosthesis, two (4 %), with retrograde nailing, and two (4 %), conservatively due to poor medical condition.	2.307958572141979
The choice of fracture management was dependent on the type and location of the fracture and on the stability of the prosthesis.	2.7855024280625087
A total of 50 fractures healed primarily.	2.3877115566607197
Complications included three cases of plate loosening, one further fracture, one deep infection, one broken bolt and one varus deformity.	1.9648396980730631
Four patients died in the postoperative period, an additional 19 were dead at the time of the evaluation.	2.5149288473364715
Fractures with a stable implant can be treated with plate fixation.	2.66544433625749
Cases of a loose implant require revision.	2.3300828476913655
Distal fractures are stabilized with a plate or with a retrograde nail.	2.3177182930958335
A young patient who underwent renewed aortic valve replacement after already open blasting of the aortic valve and following valve replacement with enlargement of the ascending thoracic aorty by using a pericardium patch had taken place is reported.	2.035481409519354
In the area of this enlargement by the pericardium patch, the development of an aneurysm was seen and was resected in the same setting without any difficulties.	2.4379355897663664
The particular items with special regard to the postoperative course are delineated in the following report.	2.5430591072156323
The situation of oncological surgery in Germany was evaluated by sending a questionnaire in January 1998 to 1979 registered surgical clinics.	2.0626673073040913
A total of 938 responded and stated that they are involved in that field.	2.205761104084677
In 72 % of the departments oncological surgery adds up to 10-30 % of their overall work.	2.277616713873538
The proportion of oncological surgery correlated to hospital size and is highest in university clinics.	2.1073591305223607
Colorectal surgery is 93 % and is the leading topographical field in oncological surgery.	2.264002396135735
73 % of the hospitals regularly perform gastric tumor surgery.	2.460877420078645
The proportion of hospitals with breast surgery is surprisingly high (45 %).	2.072907656902558
Together with adjuvant therapy this rate amounts to 85.2 %.	2.1527802021388567
The diagnostic spectrum of the hospitals involved in the inquiry is statisfactory.	2.499145123181768
However, the modern possibilities of network and telecommunication are not sufficiently used.	2.025848019454841
A second opinion is required predominantly in their own department or clinic, but not between centers.	2.26723929528519
The surgeon's position concerning the speciality "surgical oncology" is ambivalent: only 35.3 % of the department chiefs support this speciality - and over 90 % of the departments reject the structural independence of "surgical oncology" from "visceral surgery".	1.807413078171107
Cryosurgery is a widely accepted modality for the treatment of capillary hemangiomas of the newborn.	2.729565711171389
However, no studies clearly supporting its effectivity are available.	2.0897922847996777
A considerable number of patients with cardiovascular diseases suffer from advanced heart failure.	2.4333400150977194
Actuarial 6-12 month survival of such patients is reduced to 50-75%.	2.424780902118046
Since introduction of triple immunosuppression including cyclosporine, azathioprine and corticosteroids heart transplantation has been established as treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment.	2.3083801232602967
However, the increasing imbalance between demand and supply of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients for this therapeutic option and requires a more restrictive listing of patients for heart transplantation.	2.1124641063270713
During the last few years promising new conservativ and alternativ surgical therapies have been developed.	2.111742874470704
The conservativ medical therapy was improved by application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive betablockers.	2.0534481128553947
Alternativ surgical therapies of advanced heart failure include high risk bypass surgery, high risk valve surgery, mechanical assist devices, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, partial left ventriculectomy, cardiomyoplasty and multisite-pacing.	1.7793738935078922
They serve as bridge to transplantation or medium- and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.	2.3148144627208738
The therapeutic success is determined by adequate selection of patients for the respective therapy.	2.472321602269883
This requires the implementation of risk scores on the basis of national and international registries of patients with advanced heart failure.	2.642792578309228
Motion analysis of the cervical spine is a sensitive tool in the fields of preventive and clinical biomechanics of whiplash.	2.5152390175762744
In the field of preventive biomechanics motion analysis contributes to validation and optimisation of dummy based crash test experiments and simulations.	1.8125749544877516
In the clinical field motion analysis up to now is of restricted value.	2.228802837238858
Data exist about restrictions and pathologies of movement and motion of the cervical spine, coordinative disturbances, postural control, TMJ-function and oculomotor disturbances after whiplash.	1.876040377618459
The standardisation of technical and clinical set-ups is necessary to establish a well proven biomechnical model of whiplash and whiplash related biomechanical dysfunction.	2.0989014984259002
Without this model the value of motion analysis for clinical use will be restricted due to lack of comparable data on sensitivity and specificity although motion analysis of the cervical spine is neither cost- nor time consuming and free of adverse effects.	2.1631975201529463
Within a prospective series of 28 patients (14 m/ 14 f) with a follow-up to six weeks we were lucky to describe numerically two different types of reaction to low energy (v < 20 km/h) rear end collision: Type I with disturbances in complex movements only, Type II with overall restriction of movement.	1.9810092301201767
Control of angular velocity during cyclic movements of the head was disturbed by oscillations of higher frequency in all patients.	2.1099456546271087
Recovery from whiplash within 6 weeks could be monitored.	2.3411718082575788
Diagnosis of parasomnias in the sleep laboratory is difficult since the nocturnal behavior reported by the patients often does not show up in the laboratory.	2.1015052529831566
To test the efficacy of sleep deprivation as a tool to provoke somnambulism we investigated ten patients (three women and seven men, mean age 27 +/- 3.4) with somnambulism.	2.111798642209658
Their standard polysomnographies and videomonitored nocturnal behavior was compared to that of sex- and age-matched controls and to polysomnography and behavior after sleep deprivation.	2.0573564378118814
Patients with parasomnias and controls did not show significant differences in sleep parameters with the exception of longer arousal duration in controls, which was nonsignificant.	2.327476605497825
In magnetic resonance tomography, patients with parasomnias did not reveal abnormality of the brain that might explain release of nocturnal behavior.	2.4530718885807756
Sleep deprivation led to significantly reduced number of arousals, reduced arousal index, significantly prolonged arousal duration and more stage shifts from all sleep stages (nonsignificant).	1.78913659678206
Complex behavior during sleep increased under sleep deprivation, whereas sleepwalking did not increase.	2.188154015857859
The majority of complex behavior during sleep is triggered by stage shifts and not by arousal in the sense of the arousal definition of the American Sleep Disorder Society.	1.9901970555024278
Complex behavior in sleep is stereotypical and nonviolent.	2.237206140470498
Its complexity seems to depend on the duration and intensity of arousals.	2.5362972861245296
Sleep deprivation can be recommended as an efficacious method of increasing complex behavior in sleep, which is a preliminary stage of sleepwalking.	2.3236309261030748
Concerning the underlying pathology it seems to be important to register the quality and duration of stimuli that trigger arousals instead of focusing the number of arousals alone.	2.5475763291356404
Introduction: In order to investigate whether operative technique determines the 5-year recurrence and survival rates, we analysed the results obtained by two surgical departments using two different operative techniques.	2.377889846435318
Department A: Removal of the tumour and a number of lymph nodes; department B: En-bloc resection in accordance with the requirements of standardised tumour surgery.	2.4310257833627835
Patients and methods: The surgical results obtained with all patients with colorectal carcinoma operated on between 1984 and 1988 (department A: 152 colon and 53 rectal carcinomas; department B: 124 colon and 177 rectal carcinomas).	1.8713884692192664
Results: The local recurrence rate achieved by department A was signicantly higher (colon carcinoma: department A 25 %; department B 10 %; rectal carcinoma: department A 54 %; department B 16 %).	1.8024600142816176
The 5-year survival rate for colon carcinoma was 65 % in department A, and 66 % in department B, the corresponding figures for rectal carcinoma being 49 % and 72 %, respectively.	1.8111993350717261
Conclusion: The results indicate that carcinoma of the colorectum should be operated on only at an institution that complies with the standards required for surgery of colorectal carcinoma.	2.1058121927450757
Definition of the problem: Ethics consultation is one of the most important ways in which clinical ethicists can support both health-care providers and patients and their relatives in coping with ethical and existential challenges.	1.9737984419594328
The practice of ethics consultation, as performed at the Freiburg University Hospital is described and illustrated by a case report about the problem of treatment termination.	2.284276310666578
The range of subject matters that come up in ethics consultations is analyzed.	1.9558770593820192
A research program in clinical ethics is summarized that has been undertaken to pave the way for a specific and interdisciplinary analysis of needs; from there on, the investigation aims at further developing clinical ethics support services.	1.851489496636111
Suggestions for criteria of competence for ethics consultants are formulated on the basis of both the author's and international work.	2.2615552820631284
Finally, the issues of structural conditions for establishing clinical ethics in the German-speaking world are raised and the long-term prospect of ethics consultation as an instrument for learning and teaching ethics in the health-care system is highlighted.	2.0921965605663244
Objectives Bridging of an extensive bone defect with a long stem revision prosthesis anchored in the diaphysis to restore a pain free function of the limb.	2.1063159809852428
A total of 205 patients suffering from stage I and stage II melanoma were investigated with reference to psychosocial stress, social support and attitude to offers of psychotherapeutic support.	2.1124894233568345
Additional counselling by their dermatologist was considered helpful by 59% of the patients, and interviews with a psychotherapist, by 20%.	2.3408695157231394
Patients who where more anxious about a progression of the cancer and thought they had not been given sufficient information about their illness preferred to seek help from the dermatologist.	1.9201294319554192
Patients who appreciated additional counselling by a psychotherapist were usually those with a poorer prognosis for their melanoma and those on whom psychosocial distress weighed especially heavily and who had less social support.	1.7998896579106476
The original structure of the synovial membrane is completely destroyed in the rheumatoid synovium and is characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration, synoviocyte proliferation, neo-vascularization, and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins.	1.9960432393259577
Adhesion molecules play an important role in the development of these pathologic changes.	2.883236835270305
In this review we discuss the role of the adhesion receptors of the selectin, integrin and immunglobulin families and of the CD44 molecule in the cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory changes in rheumatoid arthritis.	2.0415414519280666
During the last five years several authors have reported largely satisfactory results, using the steroid intravenous anaesthetic eltanolone (pregnanolone) for induction of anaesthesia after administering a bolus dose.	1.8957553211630465
Until now, however, no investigations have been undertaken, dealing with the infusion pharmacokinetics of eltanolone after arterial blood sampling and using slow induction to quantify the concentration-effect relationship.	1.9759085775457017
Secondary objectives were to assess the haemodynamic and respiratory effects.	2.694160712388403
Background: Intraoperative measurements of local intracapillary hemoglobin oxygenation of the human cochlea via the round window membrane have been shown to be possible using the Erlangen microlight-guided spectrophotometer.	2.0787966433843463
The aim of the present study was to develop a new microlight guide suitable for measurements in the round window niche and to evaluate electrophysiologically the possible impact of the procedure on the cochlea.	2.1376179960383523
High-dose UVA1 therapy is an effective treatment of patients with acute atopic dermatitis.	3.0201190721290296
However, some patients do not respond well to this new therapy.	2.193442420149495
We attempted to further characterize the non-responder population in a retrospective study.	2.4176544797237707
Two closely matched groups of responders (n=20) and non-responders (n=20) were compared.	2.4431558368749378
No significant differences were observed between both groups with respect to the following parameters: skin type, minimal erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, and peripheral blood eosinophils.	2.107415233739123
However, non-responders were characterized by a highly elevated atopic score, and by high levels of total IgE and of specific IgE.	2.466148985596993
Furthermore, colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus occured at higher densities, and intestinal growth of Candida albicans was more frequently observed.	2.2028152217472305
These data indicate that high-dose UVA1 irradiation is not effective in all patients suffering from atopic dermatitis.	2.7549944486616043
We conclude that non-responders with complicating infections might benefit from the combination of high-dose UVA1 therapy and antibiotic or antimycotic treatment.	2.209782839866751
The objective of our study was to demonstrate the current position of doctors in general practice all over Austria who prescribe prescriptions.	2.1154671643635026
We report a woman with erythema palmare hereditarium, an anomaly not documented so far in the German literature.	1.9098595547526995
It is characterized by a bright erythema of the palms, usually persistent since birth.	2.1179454633402575
It is transmitted in an autosomal-recessive mode and has a benign course.	2.3886140736894648
In our patient it was possible to trace the palmar erythema over three generations.	2.1207801834728084
The decline of STD in the region of Rostock, Germany, since 1945 is explained by a decreasing incidence of gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis.	2.0878564291741433
On the other hand chlamydial and candidal infections have increased.	2.07517807418745
Genital candidal infections were to be found in 23%.	2.6705881274480596
Mycoplasmas were identified in 15%, usually combined with other pathogens except in some cases of vaginitis.	2.4445159308199784
The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has changed considerably in the last few decades.	2.572829316939961
Clinical observation of mainly unicentric pathogenesis with continuous expansion and subclinical involvement of adjoining regions of lymph nodes has resulted in the introduction of a large-field technique with total nodal irradiation (TNI) or total lymphatic irradiation (TLI).	1.9574471103606499
The introduction of polychemotherapy has led to further improvement in the cure rate and in considerations concerning using both methods and adapting them to the stage and risk.	2.0627354512777263
Today the combination of radiation and chemotherapy leads to a reduction in the amount of radiation required in the affected regions (involved field irradiation = IFI).	2.4207767507760534
The German Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was founded by Martin Waßmund in 1951.	2.0071576649026373
One of the main reasons was the need for scientific representation in the council at a medical convention.	2.295447211908422
The Society, originally composed of 52 members, was first called "The German Society of Maxillofacial Surgery".	2.023172907810308
In 1972, it extended its title to include the term "oral" ("Mund") and currently comprises 620 members.	1.8405533818642676
A scientific conference is held annually on a specific topic.	2.1481176528314885
The lectures given there have been published since 1954 in "Fortschritte der Kiefer- und Gesichts-Chirurgie" (Progress in Maxillofacial Surgery) by Thieme Verlag; since 1997, they have appeared as a Springer-Verlag supplement.	1.812514014454948
Topics of choice are published in "Mund,- Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie" ("Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery"), originally by Hanser in Munich and now by Springer-Verlag in Heidelberg.	1.8261676665354292
In this manner, it was possible to completely document the scientific activities and progress in this specialty.	2.163968357831568
Each year since 1957, a prize named after M. Waßmund, has been given for outstanding scientific accomplishment.	1.9921573644770905
The presidents, convention locations, topics, and prizewinners are listed in a table.	1.9172661761267216
Since the founding of the Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, close cooperation has existed with the National Association of German Oral and Maxillary-Facial Surgeons (Bundesverband der Deutschen Ärzte für Mund-Kiefer-Gesichts-Chirurgie).	1.6274284648483337
In order to intertwine scientific and political interests, a fusion of these two organizations is planned for the year 2000.	2.051833323523547
The hepatorenal syndrome is defined as the development of renal failure in patients with severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable cause of renal functional impairment.	2.9075559413052363
The pathogenesis of this obviously functional renal failure is complex and not completely understood.	2.0428938229575877
Of importance seems to be a peripheral and systemic vasodilatation with redistribution of blood volume.	2.459273856203149
Nitric oxide seems to play a major role as a possible primary mediator.	2.478246620132307
As a consequence changes in several different pathophysiological mechanisms (sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin, endothelin, prostanoids, natriuretic peptides) lead to a functional renal impairment which is characterized by renal cortical vasoconstriction.	1.8899659629920187
Supportive treatment and intensive monitoring of the cardiovascular circulation is the main goal in the care of these patients.	2.6237627694554346
The mortality is still high exceeding 90%.	2.4837282552136357
Renal extracorporeal support should be initiated using a continuous method when recovery of liver function is expected (acute liver failure, waiting for liver transplantation).	1.9263651555522194
A 16 year old patient with the typical clinical signs of Albright's hereditary dystrophia developed series of epileptic seizures with loss of consciousness, tonic muscle contractions and bite of the tongue.	2.17502512503743
After termination of the seizures there was coma without focal neurological signs.	2.141810005047929
CT scan revealed diffuse brain edema.	2.5514873045498825
Electroencephalographic studies showed generalized slowing.	2.5793470270050354
In laboratory tests the only abnormalities were marked hypocalcemia (1.15 mmol/l) and hyperphosphatemia.	2.0675825381168846
Blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) was elevated.	2.3628094229101597
PTH-Test confirmed the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism.	2.9354625148761477
After few days the severe encephalopathy, CT and electroencephalographic changes were completely reversible.	2.143464384177739
Hereditary disturbances of the parathyroid hormone metabolism are rare diseases.	2.6224834208332486
Hypocalcemia must be included into the differential diagnosis of seizures and brain edema to avoid invasive diagnostic and irrational treatment.	2.237585439521302
An adequate increase of uterine blood flow throughout gestation is essential for uterine, placental and fetal growth.	2.070108097975746
Maternal cardiovascular adaptation has to provide the uterine perfusion that is necessary to meet the requirements of the developing and growing fetus by providing transport of nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and the fetus.	2.0863868403958072
Reductions of uterine blood flow can occur under acute or chronic conditions or in a combination of both.	2.401629408215964
Chronic restrictions in uterine blood flow will elicit a placental and fetal response in the form of growth adaptation to the reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients to the conceptus.	1.981378827880902
If compensatory growth restriction reaches its limits intrauterine fetal distress can ensue.	2.000998070901152
In view of a possible Stent implantation, 20 infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated.	1.9380886649903653
Measurements were performed according to toporegional criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters.	2.24376742103426
Then we correlated the extent of the proximal and distal necks to the aneurysmal lengths and diameters, respectively.	2.2860781552725777
The following results were obtained: 1.	2.6009989348776026
Depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm, there is an inproportional shortening of the proximal and distal neck.	2.7045209474266603
Up to an aneurysmal length of 4 cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases.	2.0453548444002987
With lengths of more than 4 cm according to the morphological results, the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple Tube-Stent.	2.260831270699598
The proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of 10 cm.	2.3131919500386124
For longer aneurysms, only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation.	2.6059554368956475
In all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall-adherent thrombi of up to three centimeter thickness in the aneurysmal and para-aneurysmal regions.	1.8100200982180052
These findings have to be considered, with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta.	2.6944811002850457
We report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48-year-old man.	2.298020892092955
These slow-growing, mostly benign and encapsulated intradural-extramedullar tumours are clinically characterized by lumbago, paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as occasi-onally by incontinence.	1.9513665833117853
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina show monomorphous (main) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern, demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so-called sustentacular cells; some tumours show focal ganglionic differentiation.	1.7027004104979642
Because of their morphological similarity to the more common ependymomas, paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated.	2.005174125246206
Immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides (main cells) and S-100 protein (sustentacular cells) while widely lacking reactivity for GFAP.	1.9627430737796934
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity, of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature.	2.320970148255748
Because they only occur sporadically, they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina.	2.57729862442215
Approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence.	2.379969721382142
The treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence, the type of primary therapy administered and the patient's general condition.	2.2806710134811845
The limit conditions for the application of the established forms of therapy available - surgical operation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy - are complex and seldom documented by randomized studies.	2.199800764496262
In general, empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned.	1.9043864558112615
The main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences.	2.5991383971049644
Post-traumatic pyogenic liver abscess is a rare disease.	2.499759449847465
We present the case of a 38-year-old man with multilocular liver abscess and pleural empyema following blunt abdominal trauma.	2.1836013451363105
The patient had a prodrome lasting 3 months before presenting in our department.	2.175500769882583
The therapy included partial hepatectomy and pleural drainage.	2.1637243701992204
Clinical signs, diagnosis and possible therapy are discussed in this case report.	3.0370175692464896
The dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his/her facility: admission, diagnosis, treatment, transfer, and discharge of patients.	2.0144876266373566
As a result it is nearly impossible to transfer medical information from one system to another without a loss of data.	1.9417167582137564
One cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years.	2.0972583347165736
Therefore we present a concept which, based on existing tools, allows communication between medical information systems.	2.0795989002056157
Shave excision of nevi is a technique still under debate.	2.185507334339679
Speed, simplicity, and the fact that it provides excised material for histologic examination are contrasted with the lack of excision margins and a higher rate of nevus recurrences.	2.3635548860413116
In this study, the pros and cons of shave excision were evaluated.	2.007997642385743
The congenital dyserythropoietic anemias represent a group of rare inborn errors with ineffective erythropoiesis as the predominant mechanism of anemia.	1.962727716575642
They are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy.	2.2440876685532656
There are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity, cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane.	2.057804167262953
In addition, patients with apparent CDA of heterogenous phenotype are observed, that cannot be attributed to any of the three types.	2.382021941311872
Recently variant genes have been localized to different regions on chromosome 15 or 22.	2.085512564339527
Cases of CDA were reported from many ethnics, in particular in families of meditarranean origin.	2.1384248980261393
Many patients load iron necessitating iron depletion.	2.2069842973642366
Gallstones are a frequent complication and are observed in childhood or adolescence.	2.4751823829441095
Therapeutic measures such as splenectomy, treatment by Interferon  or allogeneic bome marrow transplantation depend on the type and the severity of clinical expression, which shows large variations both within and between affected kindreds.	2.0238288665737008
Sarcopenia is a constant in aging.	2.560736161259432
Observed over long periods, it can reach 1% per year.	2.421614717717984
But it is such a tenuous phenomenon that it cannot be observed over short periods at steady state.	1.9455767241306818
The aging phenomenon mainly hits fibers, Type II but on aged muscle thin, normal, and hypertrophic fibers cohabit with sclerosis and fat increases.	1.7524267328100502
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterised by stage-dependent microangiopathy.	2.3210668815707622
With increasing severity there is a decrease in the number of skin capillaries and the oxygen partial pressure.	2.7432974745889958
The cutaneous vascular reserve, which is measured by laser-doppler fluxmetry, is reduced.	2.396837375092307
Cutaneous microangiopathy is one of the main causes of the trophic disturbances associated with CVI.	2.4193986571437107
Low frequency pulsed current improves cutaneous microcirculation and thus nutrition as well as accelerating the formation of granulation tissue.	2.368038687397964
In a open prospective pilot study, 15 patients suffering from CVI with persistent leg ulcers were treated with low frequency pulsed current (Dermapulse), which is thought to improve particularly the tissue microcirculation.	2.384406072033142
The average age of the patients was 70.3 years and the average duration of ulceration was 79.1 months.	2.4317632430699563
The patients were treated over a period of 38 days.	2.8633192411949713
With this treatmen, 2 ulcers healed completely and 13 showed a reduction of size of on average 63%.	2.066955796733287
Capillary density increased by 43.5%, while transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure increased by 82.4%.	2.048158225773717
Electrostimulation is a treatment with few or no side effects.	2.4393148551395356
From 1986 to 1996, we implanted a total of 92 hip arthroplasties (86 cementless, 4 hybrid and 2 cemented) in 65 patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	2.0093716573749143
Of the 89 uncemented cups, 59 were threaded cups (Hofer-Imhof n = 45, Zweymüller n = 7, Mecring n = 5, PM n = 2) and 30 were hemispherical cups of the Harris Galante type I and II.	1.7609734614805006
87 stems were implanted without cement (Zweymüller SL n = 58, Uni n = 16, Schenker n = 9, Zweymüller I n = 4) and 5 with cement.	1.9311095882290827
To date, one cup of each threaded type had to be revised because of loosening (revision rate approx.	2.0184996948146767
6.8 %); Up to now, three of 87 (approx.	2.418815333666326
3.4 %) stem revisions (1 x Zweymüller I, 1 x Schenker, 1 x Zweymüller SL) have been undertaken.	2.184268618533312
Ten patients with twelve hip arthroplasties did not return for follow-up; some of them had a poor general health status.	2.3287656070155642
The clinical and radiological results of the arthroplasties of 52 patients showed a Harris Hip Score averaging 72 after an average of 54 months (min.	2.4870769933145978
Ten patients had minor complaints in the hip region.	2.37641654101132
79 % of the uncemented implants (70 out of 89 cups, 69 out of 87 stems) were assessed radiologically.	1.9435169901539817
This subsided markedly after filling with cancellous bone and recentering of the hip joint.	2.14908163071341
Homogeneous incorporation of the bone grafting und thus remodelling of the medial wall was achieved, with the bone graft exhibiting marked reduction.	2.527366827793036
At final follow-up, approx.	3.073580159901354
75 % of the cementless cups had complete bone ingrowth without any evidence of radiolucency (type I), approx.	2.041747125915533
19 % had near-complete bone ingrowth with minimal radiolucencies in one zone or in a maximum of 50 % of the bone contact area (type II) and approx.	2.110027734179985
6 % had radiolucencies in more than 50 % of the bone contact area (type III).	2.3279599389635184
The radiographic evaluation of the most frequently used stem (Zweymüller SL) showed approx.	2.884029724597301
47 % with only slight remodelling of the calcar (type I), approx.	2.110901359127665
33 % with moderate loss of femoral density (type II) and approx.	2.1673318935127073
20 % with severe bone loss and thinning of cortical bone (type III).	2.101400873941352
Abstract   The 5th edition of the TNM classification entails a number of changes concerning head and neck tumors.	2.2499985479239815
The division of stage IV tumors into three subcategories marks a significant expansion of the stage grouping procedure.	1.9785956791386452
Methods: In a retrospective study the clinical course of 3247 patients with head and neck carcinomas were comparatively evaluated according to the 4th and 5th editions of the new TNM classification.	2.3040745280347115
In particular it was the aim of the study to test the prognostic relevance of the subdivision of stage IV especially in mucosal cancer.	2.3260701189089334
Results: In classifying the primary tumor the most extensive changes were noted for supraglottic and salivary gland tumors.	2.093668550955575
On the basis of the 4th edition of the TNM classification the following recurrence-free 5-year survival rates for 3033 cases of mucosal cancer were calculated: stage I 91,0%, stage II 78,6%, stage III 61,4%, stage IV 31,0%.	1.8746610126087566
The calculations based on the 5th edition yielded: stage I 91,0%, stage II 77,2%, stage III 61,2%, stage IVA 32,4%, stage IVB 25,3%, stage IVC 3,6%.	2.091631044745142
Conclusions: The adequacy of the revised stage classification in establishing a prognostic hierarchy was confirmed.	1.9661252631316057
However, a significant prognostic distinction between N2- (stage IVA) and N3-metastasis (stage IVB) could not be found.	2.048451069612625
The microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue, and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell.	2.174703663193802
Modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high-resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer-assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock-out gene technology.	2.2209409501931145
These advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, and transplantation.	1.7810056239313408
Legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Germany.	2.2208511225225105
This article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against PGD.	2.117359625455264
In the autor's view neither the fact that PGD is not a well established technique nor the danger that single-cell-analysis may lead to misdiagnosis convincingly demonstrates that PGD is morally inacceptable.	2.2227347120271856
Inconsistencies in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept PGD are highlighted.	1.9751758565282012
The use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing PGD is criticised.	2.0055995165231817
Extensive counselling prior to PGD should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision.	2.202546318042903
The SOFA score, a new system for patients with sepsis-related diseases, was introduced in 1994 by the "Working Group on Sepsis-Related Problems of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine."	2.0489704592566467
The purpose of this study was to compare the new SOFA score with the APACHE II and MOD scores.	1.943991436900116
The data on 874 patients from a surgical intensive care unit in an university hospital were analyzed using commercially available software (SPSS for Windows, Version 7.5.2 and MS Excel '97).	1.8045677738461012
To compare the different scores, receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) - analyses were applied.	1.996728862379052
The study demonstrated a clear correlation between an elevated SOFA score and the mortality of the patients during their ICU stay (score 0 -> mortality 0 %, 1 -> 3.6 %, 2 -> 22.5 %, 3 -> 86,7 %, respectively r = 0.445; P = 0,01).	2.1256934670789938
The ROC analyses of the APACHE II, the MOD and the SOFA scores were comparable (area under the curve: APACHE II 0.73, MOD 0.77, SOFA 0.71).	1.7976193779207863
In conclusion, the SOFA score is reliable and might be useful in the daily routine of an intensive care unit.	2.1032451996052526
In individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome.	2.1288346630721278
For the first time we investigated a total of 100 HNSCC by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis.	2.215971903713018
Patients were followed for at latest 4 but at least 2 years after surgery or until death.	2.272980683580292
During this observation period twenty-nine of them died because of cancer disease.	2.2472579221942386
The Kaplan-Meier method was used plotting survival curves for every single chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico-pathological parameter.	2.194471369958222
Significance of particular prognostic parameters was then evaluated by the Cox regression model.	2.184415277416473
The overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly lower in patients who's tumors showed amplifications of the chromosomal region 11q13 (p=0.0008 for LR and p=0.0024 for B).	1.982890715193393
The survival time of the patients was also lower if the carcinomas carried overrepresentations of chromosome 3q (p=0.0299 for LR and p=0.0546 for B).	2.119447337497253
Multivariate analysis (Cox's proportional hazards model) revealed both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in HNSCC.	1.9522378502118212
None of the conventional clinico-pathological parameters (pT-, pN-status, UICC stage, grading) achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model.	1.8352572127206777
We report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient.	2.1422772006751796
The foamy cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed S-100 and Vimentin.	2.157603248811799
HMB45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma.	2.513011718567702
Detection of HMB45 in some of the nevus-associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation.	2.2487235496985183
We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a malignant, primary plaque-type blue naevus in a 61-year-old male.	2.516155621912794
Two biopsy specimens had been examined within 13 years, and revealed a common and cellular blue variant as a precursor.	2.159340945415212
Locally invasive growth and regional lymph node swelling were present, but these alone could not confirm malignancy before evaluation of all clinical and histopathological features, as they are known to occur with benign cellular blue naevi.	2.166999428892612
The recent literature and our case indicate that there is a malignant potential in every histological and clinical variant of blue naevus.	2.2027586204126477
It is difficult to provide valid data with regard to changes in incidence and prevalence of acute pancreatitis in Germany.	2.4109592219251677
The lack of information is due to strict legal regulations to protect personal data, a certain lack of interest in epidemiological research and the lack of exact statistics of diseases treated in hospitals.	2.068963718449355
The incidence of acute pancreatitis in other industrialized Western countries is about 10 new cases per year and 100,000 inhabitants.	2.010824266534047
The increase of alcohol consumption over the last 30 years is associated with an increase of ethanol-induced pancreatitis.	2.536763430666628
One may speculate that due to improved diagnostic possibilities, such as CT scan, cases where acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at autopsy are rare.	2.136812350122811
Due to the increase in alcohol consumption it can be assume that the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis have increased in Germany similar to well-documented data from Denmark.	2.280322387517274
Since alcohol consumption is slightly decreasing in Germany it is likely that the present incidence of about 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis per 100,000 inhabitants will also decrease.	2.072229093303238
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, estecming, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapie.	1.4903250078662917
This form of treatment is scientifically validated (Grawe 1997).	2.3002308365382436
Its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	1.8039264967615223
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	1.541800531021673
This second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks.	2.5070124992673986
At last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed, and available outcome data is summarized.	2.140458274910979
The human arterial blood pressure shows not only exogenic alterations, but also spontaneous fluctuations.	2.4115082892774544
This blood pressure variability has both scientific and clinical relevance.	2.446936698789036
A well-known phenomenon is the so-called "white coat hyptertension" which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension.	2.4010952140152515
Furthermore, several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end-organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the circardian blood pressure variability.	2.3895181376383556
Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration.	2.6334672784982667
The faeces sign is a recently described computed tomography (CT) feature of small-bowel obstruction and is seen as a mottled, faeces-like content within the lumen of the dilated loops above the level of the obstacle.	2.0057776350952783
To evaluate its prevalence, significance, and diagnostic value we retrospectively reviewed 94 consecutive cases of small-intestine obstruction studied with CT in the last 6 years.	2.1000684789618007
The faeces sign was recognizable in 7 cases (7.4 %) and was localized within ileal loops in all these subjects.	2.0248211354066217
In 6 of the 7 cases there was a simple and progressive obstruction, while there was a sudden onset with intestinal strangulation in only 1.	2.278489281670768
The faeces sign is due to the intraluminal stagnation of enteric material and is generally recognizable in subjects with subacute obstruction.	2.1223539866913033
In our experience it is relatively uncommon.	2.244623897199817
Nevertheless, it seems to be rather specific and may be a valuable accessory feature in the CT study of small-bowel obstruction.	2.561305896895663
A case report is presented to illustrate the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythaemia.	2.2176837760418913
Treatment may prevent severe haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications.	2.2217997089853334
Erythromelalgia is causally related to thrombocythaemia; prompt relief of painful symptoms after treatment with aspirin is typical.	2.092713935592497
Surgical treatment of proximal aortic disease traditionally consists of composite replacement of valve and aorta.	1.948651654068172
Recent reconstructive procedures on the aortic root allow for treatment of aortic dilatation and concomitant aortic valve regurgitation without the associated disadvanteages of mechanical heart valves.	2.000488843016451
Two psychotic patients developed hyperglycaemia several weeks after starting olanzapine.	2.1540314802375664
In one case the elevated glucose concentrations returned to normal soon after withdrawal of olanzapine.	1.912241482597027
Profilometry is a novel procedure allowing precise analysis of skin surface structure.	2.218018035398623
With the help of a synthetic material a negative image of a defined area of the skin is taken.	2.4806458351981484
During the subsequent analytical procedure the roughness is determined by means of a profilometer.	2.419163957358731
A commercially available statistics software program is used for statistical analysis of the results.	2.579522012131819
This procedure was applied to check for to evaluate positive effects of oestrogen creams on the structure of the skin surface on the face.	2.4232498814824197
This article describes the historic roots of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) from the first experiments at 1800 until the introduction into the pharmaceutical market in 1899.	1.7987419406830865
In 1869, Hermann Kolbe enlightened the chemical structure of salicylic acid, which was used at that time as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	1.9753000612979918
Because of the side effects, for example the irritation of the stomach, analytical chemists and pharmacologists searched for chemical modifications.	2.329884734890314
In August 1897 Felix Hoffmann (1868-1946) was successful in acetylizing the salicylic acid to acetylsalicyl acid (ASA).	1.7780339750433622
Between 1897 and 1899 Kurt Witthauer (1865-1911) collected clinical data and experiences on the efficiency of ASA as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	1.7856669418101803
The indication exceeds analgesia in the mean time and to prophylaxis of myocardial ischaemia or cerebral stroke, among others.	2.087921650733824
Background: The results of the Cryo-ROP group showed that cryotherapy significantly reduces the rate of adverse morphological and functional outcome of eyes with threshold retinopathy of prematurity.	2.2574309437301685
Structural status and visual acuity of 48 eyes which consecutively underwent cryocoagulation in our hospital between 1990 and 1994 were examined at 2 years corrected gestational age.	1.9456874425751298
Despite wide-spread immunisation programs epidemic influenza continues to cause ten thousands of deaths worldwide, every year, especially in the high risk groups of elderly or immunocompromised persons.	2.011891565345856
At present, amantadine and rimantadine are the only approved agents available for prophylactic and therapeutic use, yet, the deployment of these substances is problematic: neither of the two drugs is effective against influenza B, their use is accompanied by rapid development of viral resistance, and they show many adverse effects.	1.8894530871604185
In contrast, zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are rationally developed influenza-specific neuraminidase inhibitors, proving prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against influenza A and B, as well in vitro as in animal models, and in experimental human studies.	2.067582472748456
Zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are well tolerated without adverse reactions after topic and oral administration, respectively.	1.9239504022700114
Resistant viral strains have been found in cell culture in the presence of both drugs, but the frequency of resistance emergence during clinical use is unclear.	2.652244095015963
To date, the biggest recognizable disadvantage of neuraminidase inhibitors and Amantadin/Rimantadin alike is that they need to be given within 30-48 h after onset of symptoms, but seeking medical attention at this stage of infection does not seem to be realistic in medical practice.	1.9373906532655865
As neuraminidase inhibitors up to now could mainly be assessed by experimental data, specifically performed clinical trials will have to prove the positive influence of these drugs on the morbidity, course of infection, and mortality of high risk persons when administered for prophylaxis as well as for therapy.	2.266657778389547
Background and purpose: Without recanalisation, acute basilar artery (BA) occlusion has a mortality of 90 %, which is reduced to 50 % if recanalisation is achieved.	2.077812662786611
Fast diagnosis of BA occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay.	2.481182010498546
We wanted to assess the role of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected acute BA occlusion.	2.67911746392678
25 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD, 62  +/-  9 years) and 18 subjects free from cardiovascular disease (28  +/-  9 years) were tested on a cycle ergometer using a graded incremental test protocol: a) in the common upright position, b) as dynamic stress echocardiography in a semi-supine position.	2.2059369344795585
Whereas no relevant differences could be detected between the two conditions for the healthy subjects concerning heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product (2 x 3 ANOVA, t-test with -adjustment), the CHD patients showed both significantly higher heart rates as well as a significantly higher rate-pressure product (50 W: 15 300  +/-  2973 mmHg/min vs. 13 822  +/-  3042 mmHg/min; 75 W: 18 028  +/-  3479 mmHg/min vs 16 337  +/-  2619 mmHg/min) on equivalent stages during stress echocardiography if compared to the sitting position.	2.0115162687275965
There were no differences for systolic blood pressure in this group; the diastolic values were higher in the sitting position at rest and during 50 W. Lactate concentrations (determined only in the healthy subjects) were significantly higher on all stages during dynamic stress echocardiography.	2.113065927515758
The workload at the individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) was significantly lower.	2.3238670973834714
A new stoechiometric mixture of 27% dicalcium-phosphate (DCPA) and 73% tetra-calcium-phosphate (TTCP) can be prepared with water intraoperatively to a paste that subsequently sets to a structurally stabile implant composed of hydroxyapatite (HA).	1.6658978072886905
Primary setting time is about 20 min; pH during setting ranges from 6.5 to 8.5.	1.9885205306684552
There is no relevant curing heat or expansion or contraction.	2.021893732392016
Compressive strength is about 50 MPa, tensile strength about 8 MPa.	2.062620234452439
Over a period of about 4 h in physiological milieu, the cement converts to hydroxyapatite.	2.060868512097742
This product is no longer redissolvable  in normal body fluid.	2.362230100146269
This cement can be used for non-load-bearing applications especially in craniofacial bone surgery.	2.492913145751747
Cranial defects due to tumour or trauma as well as deficits in the facial skeleton may be reconstructed using this new biomaterial.	2.3932513056358777
In nine of ten patients we used the hydroxyapatite cement successfully for reconstructions in the craniofacial area.	2.0970084486565765
Fluid control of the operation field and implant site is extremely important and sometimes difficult to achieve.	2.483113447385629
Further applications could be all non-load-bearing augmentations such as filling of blocked paranasal sinuses, of dentoalveolar cysts and defects following dental apectomy or fixation of implanted hearing-aid electrodes.	1.721175781383182
The perspectives for the hydroxyapatite cement include its application as a carrier for osteogenic protein preparations, especially because of its isothermic reaction and intrinsic osteoconductive characteristics.	1.8650293928328965
We present a non-invasive epilepsy surgery protocol, which includes EEG-video-monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT).	1.9749669291021636
According to this non-invasive protocol 50 of 173 patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy underwent resective surgery.	2.063783363856402
The localization of the epileptogenic zone was based on the congruence of the localizing results of EEG-video-montoring, MRI, interictal PET and ictal SPECT.	2.064437923646549
46 (92%) of the patients had temporal and 4 (8%) had extratemporal epilepsies.	2.745100182303355
78% (n=39) of all patients operated according to our non-invasive protocol were postoperatively completely or almost seizure free.	2.3326090972229787
Extramesiotemporal resections could be carried out without invasive EEG-recording if the epileptogenic zone was not adjacent to the eloquent cortex.	2.0202970395434283
We conclude from our results that in a considerable number of patients with medically intractable particularly temporal focal epilepsies, resective epilepsy surgery can be based on non-invasive EEG-evaluations and the risk of invasive recordings can be avoided.	2.4164292704894663
We report on a 74-year old female who atypically developed a NME after surgical treatment of a rectal adenocarcinoma.	2.4202219530390465
Continuous staging and laboratory investigation over four years gave no evidence of any metastasis or further neoplasia.	2.0838640149324354
Hair samples and perspiration collected from long term drug addicts (n = 18) under constant methadone treatment were investigated.	1.98208047585428
Hair segments representing the individual hair growth of 4 weeks were analyzed for methadone, opiates and cocaine by GC/MS.	1.9991163185699037
The results obtained from the transdermal collection devices confirmed the presence of drug substances in variable amounts on the skin surface, methadone being the main analyte.	2.176098751181887
The perspiration test period lasted for 4 days.	2.3508958016254913
For six persons illicit drugs similar to those in the corresponding hair samples were found.	2.257240928823933
Overall, a poor relationship (r = 0,602) was found between the methadone dose under steady state conditions and the methadone level in hair.	1.9901961955513536
The results are discussed in the light of pharmacokinetic aspects, drug uptake by perspiration and forensic interpretation.	2.1489749365700535
Bilateral carotid artery dissection is a rare and unusual complication of blunt cervicofacial trauma.	2.440193730073597
The diagnosis of a carotid injury is rarely suspected in trauma patients with neurological deficits.	2.2007212840172636
Neurological symptoms may develop in a delayed fashion.	2.369985836245327
Angiography should be considered in trauma patients with hemiplegia and a normal mental status and in patients with blunt cervical trauma with an abnormal neurological examination.	2.5074819563123913
Initial heparinisation can prevent arterial thrombosis and neurological deterioration.	2.2583115472986264
The authors report their findings which are based on 10 years of interdisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of chronic pain patients.	2.6247584951493934
They point out the practical use of their findings in daily practice.	2.3260624735274495
Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmHg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria.	2.130095079160896
In primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis, ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma.	1.9503591395261526
Secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery.	2.743312188664768
The effects are decreased cardiac output, pulmonary atelectasis, oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion.	2.2075176747428626
Effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure.	2.2648185434576154
Normal values are between 0 and 7 cm H2O, after elective laparotomies 5-12 cm H20.	2.1637968770523517
Above 25 cm H20 they are definitely pathological.	2.327262454542276
For the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended.	2.4249626464219323
Between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in 377 patients.	1.9499447282828883
In 16 % of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31  +/-  4 cm H20 preoperatively, which could be lowered to 17  +/-  4 cm H20 by laparostomy.	2.294928116148222
An early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18 % of the cases.	3.085183494543515
Conclusions: The abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems.	2.137781516294861
The temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances.	2.3615134837301337
In general, assessment of the correct placement of a central venous catheter is performed by fluoroscopy or by postinsertional chest X-ray.	2.2008623302866277
We report a case of intraaortic malposition of a central venous catheter in a 59-year-old male patient that was not detectable in chest films.	2.11450983336228
Further exploration of this patient revealed a left-sided superior vena cava.	2.315966922607301
Definition of the problem: In 1997, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) was performed in 138.001 cases in Germany.	2.2199119159048277
The standard indications, single vessel disease and badly controlled angina, are more and more extended to multivessel disease with and without severe angina, unstable or preinfarction angina, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) itself.	1.9829538626216185
Dilating asymptomatic stenoses of more than 70-80% is a widely used indication, intending prophylaxis of complete occlusion and AMI.	2.148288236823933
Actually there is no generally accepted guideline for the different new indications, conservative versus invasive treatment schedule.	2.263938261683956
It is difficult for the patient to get appropriate information before his decision between mechanical procedures and conservative methods; authentic informed consent actually seems to be in a very bad position.	2.205899106423124
In 1992 the working group called "Arbeitsgemeinschaft leitender kardiologischer Krankenhausärzte (ALKK)" decided to start a registry of all PTCA procedures, in order to gain knowledge about the present status of PTCA in Germany.	1.93149865763064
Up to March 1999, 198.608 PTCA are logged.	2.112681160909615
Two children developed multiple melanocytic naevi after polychemotherapy administered for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in one and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the other.	2.110927615038324
Induction of naevi does not seem to be related to specific agents used in chemotherapy, but rather to the immunosuppression resulting from multiple-agent chemotherapy.	2.0608731290427715
Many small randomized studies with <beta>-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure have been published in recent years.	2.7190844629774515
A large meta-analysis by Lechat combining 18 studies with 3023 patients showed a 32% reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers.	2.3706546856501634
Mortality and hospitalization together were reduced by 37%.	2.3516478083958114
In 1998 two large randomized trials investigating Bisoprolol (CIBIS II) and Metoprolol (MERIT-HF) were finished.	1.8367670724009189
The ongoing COMET study compares <beta>1-selective blockers like metoprolol with vasodilatative <beta>-blockers like carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure.	2.1286274409309627
Large clinical registries demonstrate clinical practicability of <beta>-blocker treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.	2.494826076841789
All patients with stabel chronic heart failure ought to be treated with <beta>-blockers additional to a basic therapy with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis.	2.1309118704579353
The <beta>-blocker therapy regimen is to start with low doses and to increase the dose carefully:"Start low and go slow".	2.0715652782248477
Purpose: Cardiac imaging includes determination of the size and structure of the cardiac chambers, valves, great vessels and the coronary arteries, chamber and valvular function, myocardial perfusion, viability and metabolism.	2.1887921581671317
A 52-year-old patient presenting with severe thoracic pain of more than 30 minutes duration and ST-segment elevation > 1 mV in leads V1-3 was given 100 mg rt-PA. With persisting thoracic pain and ST-segment elevation, coronary angiography was performed 90 minutes after administration of thrombolytic therapy.	1.9724791332123457
Surprisingly, angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in presence of marked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	2.086318717701124
New onset of thoracic pain after four hours led to chest raiograph demonstrating increased mediastinal widening and new pleural effusion as compared to a baseline chest film prior to rt-PA. Spiral computed tomography revealed overt Type B aortic dissection with an intimal flap and communication distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with signs of a mediastinal hematoma.	1.9761500637592064
Immediate cardiac surgery with replacement of the dissected aortic segment was successfully performed.	2.2775776004826893
A literature review revealed 4% of aortic dissection to present with electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction and 13% to have concomitant coronary artery disease; moreover 34 cases of aortic dissection were misdiagnosed as infarction and subjected to thrombolytic agents with a mortality of 64% underlining the importance of exclusion of dissection prior to thombolytic therapy.	1.995393287193443
Between 1984 and 1996 we performed a Mason gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity: 14 patients (average age 40 (26-48) years, body mass index (BMI) 48 (37-71) kg/m2, excessive body weight 67 (41-116) kg).	1.9570858894075747
Since the end of 1996 we now apply adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding (lab band): 73 patients (average age 39 (22-64) years, BMI 45 (32-69) kg/m2, excessive body weight 66 (41-116) kg).	1.8044549281302549
We compared the early and late results of both methods.	2.51313228423555
Early results: no relevant morbidity or mortality for neither method.	2.1508690492611673
Late/intermediate results: reoperation rate for both methods 15 %.	2.2588176201070445
After an average of 3.7 years the excessive body weight loss (EWL) for gastroplasty was 54 (22-96) %.	1.984375396537631
The EWL after lab band for 24 patients after 12 months was 47 (11-127) % and for 8 patients after 18 months 51 (28-139) %.	1.9565793645965814
Since the introduction of the lap band the number of bariatric operations has greatly increased.	2.4396827384959656
Nevertheless, the perioperative complication rate has remained low, and the long-term outcome is similar for both methods.	2.6113477376012955
We investigated the relationships between prolactin (PRL) levels and antibody occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	1.803516733523068
No significant association between PRL levels and the majority of the autoantibodies studied (anti-U1 RNP, anti-rRNP, anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, anti-DNP, auto-LCA, anti-EACA) could be confirmed (P > 0.05), anti-Ro/SSA antibodies being an exception.	2.0699103492242115
Our results showed significantly increased frequencies of these antibodies in the group of female SLE patients with normal PRL levels (< 20 µg/L): anti Ro/SSA in 53% (P < 0.025, 2 = 5.80, RR = 4.0) and anti-Ro/SSA + anti-Ro/La in 60% (P < 0.05, 2 = 4.05) compared with female SLE patients with hyperprolactinemia.	1.8422178657550374
An echinococcal cyst of the heart is a rare cause of acute cardiac tamponade.	2.7685455908600467
We report on a 24 year old male from the Kosovo who was brought in an emergency state from a provincial hospital complaining of severe dyspnea, thoracic pain, dizziness, and a short period of unconsciousness.	1.9527002370038058
Surgical decompression had to be performed urgently, because the pericardium could not be punctuated due to the position of the hydatid cyst.	2.8847284594409417
We report on the case of a 51-year-old female patient who had been suffering from multiple itching nodules for 3 years.	2.3374886904098764
In two KA, HPV subtype 2 was identified by in situ hybridization.	2.178504429431076
The outbreak of multiple KA in our patient resembled a rare subtype described by Witten and Zak.	2.0422611891874753
Postclinical follow-up for 28 months to date has revealed that the KA arise from the subacute prurigo lesions.	2.3740549133775444
This mode of prurigo-dependent KA development has not previously been reported.	2.082751297801961
We describe a rare case of a papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve occurring simultaneously with a cystic tumor (a so-called mesothelioma) of the atrioventricular nodal region.	2.5581912002605978
At autopsy the tumor was found to prolapse into and occlude the right coronary ostium, leading to an acute, recurring myocardial infarction.	2.4872101068684422
Histological examination of the grossly unremarkable conduction system of the heart revealed a cystic tumor in the region of the atrioventricular node.	2.672432705295007
To our knowledge, this is the first report of coexistence of these two rare cardiac tumors.	2.0595075703882704
Although still rare, pregnancy and delivery in women with spinal cord injuries is becoming more frequent (Table 2).	2.115727924729665
In 85%-90% of patients with lesions above T6 symptoms of autonomic hyperreflexia (Table 1), especially paroxysmal and excessive increases in arterial blood pressure, may occur.	2.5116918464862112
In anaesthesising a 31-year-old paraplegic primigravida with a complete transverse spinal lesion at T4 for an elective caesarean section, no indication of hypertonic cardiovascular dysregulation either intra- or postoperatively was observed after repeated epidural administration of bupivacaine.	1.893522263789662
Distinct intraoperative spasticity of the abdominal wall muscles was, however, not influenced by the dosages selected.	2.697877978132958
Repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless method to induce transient activation in circumscript regions of the human cortex.	2.4444195216419438
In contrast to TMS with single pulses rTMS allows a more effective stimulation of association cortex and temporary interference with the proper functioning of stimulated areas.	1.7985385588766285
Possible applications for examination of the functional anatomy of language lateralisation, memory functions and visual perception are discussed.	2.1793329077139396
Possible therapeutic for movement  disorders and depression are discussed.	2.228001093027049
On the basis of theoretical considerations  and current experience rTMS induced epileptogenic effects are discussed and safety  recommendations are given.	1.9727589381282282
An unusual shaped piece of skin was found in the oral cavity of a woman who had been stabbed to death.	2.5590548366377357
Physical examination of the victim's numerous male acquaintances revealed one to have an injury of the same shape on the ventral surface of the left ring finger.	2.422317368724645
Molecular biological investigations showed that this suspect and the piece of skin exhibited corresponding DNA patterns (frequency 1 : 700 000).	1.8608420893203013
This case underlines the importance of physical examination as a preliminary to further detailed investigation.	2.276439925291319
Nineteen men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence grade II and III (mean follow-up 12.7 months) underwent periurethral injections of collagen.	2.2427658334388925
In all, 37 procedures were performed; 58 % of the patients underwent the procedure at least twice.	2.555203922034677
A mean of 16 ml collagen was injected.	2.261752889057684
The results were successful directly after injections, leaving all patients continent; however, after 3 months the treatment failed and all patients returned to their incontinence status as seen preoperatively.	1.921519349870782
No perioperative complications were noted.	2.6620591110439937
Despite the simple and safe nature of this procedure, men with severe postoperative stress incontinence do not benefit from periurethral collagen injections.	2.0949403124598445
After a short review of the literature, some aspects of the psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania with an adolescent patient are presented that up to now have not been described in great detail.	2.557492187789445
Against the backdrop of previous fears of being abandoned, the patient feels threatened that while coping with the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness she will be dropped once again.	1.8744132778276867
This psychodynamically oriented therapy makes it possible for the patient to accept and verbalize the corresponding feelings in a relationship that gives a feeling of security.	2.097077845513491
Therefore, the symptoms that previously served the purpose of regulating diffuse inner tensions and fears may be abandoned.	1.947009118470183
According to sonographic criteria, 55 patients underwent surgical treatment with mobilisation in a lower leg plaster or conservative treatment with early mobilisation in heel pad (3 cm) shoes when an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) was diagnosed.	1.851670924298265
The follow-up period in 51 patients was 2.4 years (operated group = 28 patients, conservative group = 23 patients) with clinical examination and testing of isokinetic muscle strength in knee joint flexion.	2.054123711473143
After surgical treatment, minor wound infections occurred in 10.6 %.	2.2687891972591276
Reruptures occurred in 13 % of the conservative group.	2.807950964858408
Following conservative treatment, the rate of stress-related achillodynia was significantly higher (P = 0.019).	2.5494570705770307
In the operated group mean isokinetic muscle strength was 13.7 % lower than in the uninvolved leg and decreased significantly with non-operative treatment to 75.3 % (P = 0.012).	2.101402167438463
We recommend surgical treatment of acute ATR.	3.1070686322980454
The indications for conservative treatment depend on the extent of the rupture (measured by ultrasound in the equinus position), the desired level of daily activity and the patient's degree of compliance.	2.2984932085176824
"MicroSort" promises to become a reliable method for preselecting the sex of our children.	2.299281369260695
As so many innovations in the field of assisted reproductive technology, however, sex selection raises difficult moral and legal issues.	2.3403940369629432
In this paper, we focus on the question whether or not sex selection calls for a legal ban.	2.1926343704061577
Since it does not seem to imply any serious harm to others, we argue in favour of the legalization of sex selection.	2.0190753178960175
Acute limb ischemia is an emergency which regularly requires operative treatment in departments of general surgery.	2.142142287202125
In about 70 % of cases there is an embolic reason for acute ischemia.	2.402908106598581
The introduction of balloon catheters reduced the surgical trauma significantly in cases of long secondary thromboses.	2.2807556787675503
More complex procedures are required in patients with preexisting chronic arterial occlusive disease.	2.593119393797288
The mortality of these emergency operations is still 10-20 % with a limb salvage rate of 80-90 %.	2.122433927306906
These infections may be lethal if empirical broad-spectrum treatment is not rapidly started at the first sign of infection (i.e., fever), and this concept is now widely recognized a standard practice.	2.170406780555475
However, the choice of antibiotics has generated considerable controversy for nearly 25 years.	2.1025426204865116
After reviewing some particularities of infection in neutropenic patients, this paper will discuss the options and present comprehensive algorithm for non-infectious diseases specialist, including recent advances about early IV-oral switch and the selection of low risk patients for outpatient management.	1.9174149984591573
Background: It has been suggested that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS).	2.426825631389197
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a classic acute phase protein.	2.3771078605105034
It is yet unclear whether, in addition to established markers as troponin T (TnT), determination of CRP in patients admitted for ACS contributes significantly to the diagnosis and prognosis of ACS.Patients and Methods: We investigated 50 patients with ACS (59.4 SD 13.9 years) in the first hour after admission and 4-24h later with respect to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).	1.9616217108779264
Fifty percent of the patients were classified as having unstable angina retrospectively.	3.2696919302301097
All patients were followed in the 6 weeks post discharge regarding death and recurrent ACS.Results: The cumulative event rate at 6 weeks after discharge was 62.5% for patients being CRP and TnT positive compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.	1.800373565804674
In TnT negative patients a positive CRP test predicted 33.3% of events and 28.8% of patients negative for CRP and TnT had events at 42 days post discharge.	1.7696971135367332
Logistic regression analysis regarding the primary endpoint including TnT and CRP (4-24h values), age, gender and diagnosis resulted in independent prediction of ACS or death by TnT (cutoff 0.1µg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).	1.78767362794682
Sensitivity/specificity for AMI diagnosis were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP 4-24h later.Conclusions: Besides TnT, high sensitivity CRP determination has no additional value for early AMI diagnosis.	1.7555667244293593
The prognosis of these patients during the first 24 hours is significantly and independently predicted by CRP measurements in addition to troponin T.	2.504231920918701
Purpose: Evaluation of clinical and morphological results in 44 consecutive patients with 45 aneurysms of the posterior circulation.	2.526423994872516
Following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in 2 to 30% of cases, depending mainly on graft age.	2.2507697234881894
Selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation - transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation - depends on various parameters including coronary morphology, left ventricular performance, comorbidity and availability of graft material.	1.9088898795362126
Catheterbased interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible, but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis - compared with native coronary arteries - have to be expected.	2.101448844987511
Repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality, patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery.	2.3284141473967415
We report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a jump-graft supplying RCA, LAD and Cx sequentially, making reintervention necessary.	1.8009411848724204
As a prerequisite serial balloon angioplasty of two native vessels was performed prior to ostial intervention.	1.9930448770537044
Intravascular-ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long-term result.	2.4501744663824256
Our case demonstrates that, if all relevant clinical parameters and different therapeutic options are taken into account, complex transcatheter angioplasty procedures are feasible and associated with a reasonable amount of risk, thus avoiding repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations.	2.1069905754031577
In recent years the indication for a mastectomy for breast cancer has been increasingly restricted.	2.3520077972653137
The use of plastic reconstructive techniques enhances the rate of breast-conserving therapy even for large breast tumors with excellent cosmetic results and oncological safety.	2.0592294431242744
The breast-to-tumor ratio and locally complete resection with free tumor margins of 1-2 cm are the most important factors in breast-conserving surgery.	2.47960521775654
Different techniques of reduction mammoplasty within the concept of oncological breast surgery not only allow large tumors in large breasts to be resected, but also relatively large tumors in normal sized or even smaller breasts to be resected.	2.0282051900377236
Other advantages are the reduction of breast size and therefore target volume before postoperative radiation procedures as well as in cancer prophylaxis and risk reduction by reducing ipsi- and contralateral breast tissue.	2.1320670698410034
Reduction mammoplasty techniques with different resection areas have to be selected for individual tumor locations.	2.413073461438039
The best symmetry is achieved by bilateral mammoplasty in a one step procedure with lumpectomy and axillary dissection.	1.9915909184928984
Oncoplastic or reconstructive surgery in the target breast is often followed by procedures to improve symmetry by contralateral reduction.	2.1273757107315157
Whenever possible, mammoplasty techniques with minimal scarring should be chosen out of a variety of reduction procedures.	2.2493687008138883
Epidermoid cysts are rare, benign tumors of the testis or, less frequently, the inguinal cord.	2.5306477504033453
Generally, they affect males between 10 and 39 years.	2.212841493813818
In newborns they are rare.	2.6612802632483423
We report on a newborn with an epidermoid cyst of the right testis that had been diagnosed in utero and was removed with preservation of the testicle.	2.188851372072713
Although there are various published descriptions of the dura mater spinalis [4, 7, 9, 11, 16], some points relating to the texture of the collagen fibres in the dura have still not been adequately explained.	1.9707622763719592
In this study the orientation of the collagen fibril bundles was revealed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy, and our observations have yielded new insights into the three-dimensional structure of the human dura mater spinalis.	2.1392350551621613
Reconstructive plastic surgery is not always possible or advisable for nasal defects following tumor resections.	2.2359856504179865
Facial prostheses offer an alternative therapy.	2.542270483789329
Since 1991, 37 patients with nasal defects after tumor surgery were treated in the Berlin Center of Facial Prostheses: 28 received "soft" silicone facial prostheses and 9 "solid" polymethylmetacrylate facial prostheses.	1.9394189829533433
In 35 patients protheses were bone-anchored: Brånemark implants were used in 12 patients and an Epitec frame construction in 23 patients.	2.052774517656979
Glue-on prostheses were applied to only two patients.	2.337204723126107
No intraoperative complications occurred at implant insertion.	2.3500879255459184
During following visits only minor inflammations were observed around implants and were treated locally.	2.066199084374808
The implant success rate was 78% for the Brånemark implants (89.7% in non- radiated areas and 50% in radiated areas) and 100% in radiated and non-radiated areas for the Epitec system.	1.9860123916786105
Our investigation shows that given the right indication, the bone-anchored facial prosthesis is safe, cosmetically acceptable, uncomplicated and not stressful for the patient.	1.976997503618165
We report a patient who developed malignant transformation of a cellular blue nevus.	2.1708606127783603
At the age of 19 years the congenital, pigmented tumor on the left buttock was histopathologically diagnosed as cellular blue nevus.	2.1024285069539213
Thirty years later the tumor dramatically increased in size, involving the entire left buttock within several months.	2.1120971489378766
Multiple biopsies revealed the presence of a cellular blue nevus within the papillary dermis and an invasive, pleomorphic pigmented sarcoma in the depth of the tissue spreading into subcutis and skeletal muscle.	2.045701033814451
General examination disclosed multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the retroperitoneum as well as a single brain metastasis.	2.4383792271654823
Despite palliative therapy with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, the patient developed generalized metastases and died within weeks.	2.3801108277087786
This case clearly confirms that cellular blue nevi have the potential for malignant transformation and that the malignant variant may behave aggressively just as a malignant melanoma.	2.0508589511877515
(Acitve alert) Hypnosis and sports in the psychotherapy of out-patients with anxiety disorders.	1.9601280012465472
A process-oriented approach combining hypnotherapeutic with cognitive-behavioral concepts within a systemic model of psychotherapy for the outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders is outlined.	1.9501033641793195
Relaxation and active alert hypnosis and different sports are used as methods of cue exposure respectively training of competence.	1.9679604319392707
The treatment is sequentially structured (motivation, symptom-control, conflict, integration).	1.9098312695756792
Active alert hypnosis catalyses the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom-control (reduction of anxiety and depression) and of conflict (modifcation of intrapsychic conficts or traumata within trance induced by physical exercises).	1.865382003238867
Endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation.	2.369094160635177
Other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery, not at the site of the pathology.	2.387400752217129
With the transforaminal approach, treatment in the epidural space has become possible.	2.3974535002534885
In a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls, risks, and complications of transforaminal surgery.	2.3955983906800324
Patient satisfaction and acceptance of the method were documented.	2.745402159576532
Some 27 patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space, excluding extremely medially situated herniations, were treated.	2.1093544853051647
We used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia.	2.062409096725036
The treated levels were L5/S1 (11), L4/5 (12), L3/4 (3), and L2/3 (1).	2.447682269930218
All areas could be reached by this approach.	2.4195200054770387
One procedure had to be abandoned because of instrumentation problems.	2.5549785261135085
Two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain.	2.321776766623317
No signs of reherniation could be found in these cases, but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring.	2.6693794898304057
Minor complications were trancient root paresthesia and headache postoperatively.	2.0819098258536783
Postoperative MRI or CT scans revealed only little scar tissue.	2.2317830771552076
This impression was supported in the open revisions we performed.	2.287993178654449
Clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly.	2.5804937552562905
Endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve, even when surgeons are acquainted with the posterolateral approach and arthroskopic surgery.	1.9476144361664478
However, it offers a good alternative to other minimally invasive procedures and has to be seen as a good alternative to open disk surgery, too.	2.3526836865939105
Quality management in a rescue coordination center (RCC) not only needs an evaluation of quantitative parameters (such as time intervals), but also an examination of the correlation between suspected and real found emergency situations.	2.155108666383174
For that purpose it is necessary to request feedback informations about kind and severity of the emergency situation from the emergency medical team working at the scene.	2.271504691759384
The case of a fatal catheter-induced cardiac tamponade in a 81-year-old woman is reported.	2.1978985368179638
Death occurred after a delay of 18 h following placement of a central venous catheter for parenteral feeding.	2.1338705311848365
According to the clinical and histological findings, placement of the catheter caused a primary perforation.	2.558428069567547
Confirmation of proper placement of the catheter tip was not performed.	2.315547477931508
Despite clinical indications on the forthcoming complication, sufficient emergency treatment was not carried out.	2.0605471377408615
Background: The rapid integration of new technology into ophthalmologic practice, e. g. LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis), is associated with new complications.	2.1785783435116675
The limitations of the new technology cannot be precisely determined.	2.498530719178876
During lamellar cuts with microkeratomes intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations occur.	1.9813002755804252
The IOP elevation during the lamellar cut cannot be determined by conventional tonometry.	2.1557656462398156
Due to its superior soft tissue contrast conventional MRI is the imaging method of  choice in the evaluation of ankle joint disorders.	2.200591929784058
Conventional MR imaging can accurately demonstrate normal or acutely injured ligaments; however, in subacute and chronic injury joint fluid necessary for delineation of injured ligaments is absent and MR arthrography should be performed.	1.7880399300930332
MR arthrography uses the intraarticular injection of contrast material to distend the joint, yielding improved discrimination of intraarticular structures.	2.073757582099178
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions tracking of contrast material into the interface can be more easily demonstrated.	2.1173231483535946
Finally, high contrast and joint distension by MR arthrography improves the detection of intraarticular loose bodies, which often require surgery.	2.1573927782830644
MR arthrography, although invasive, may provide additional information in various ankle joint disorders.	2.1697800295590084
Several studies have demonstrated an association Chlamydia pneumoniae with coronary artery disease, suggesting that infection with C. pneumoniae increases the risk for coronary artery disease by factor 2 or more.	2.227744097478997
Since atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory process, these data would fit into the response-to-injury hypothesis of atherosclerosis rather than representing a completely novel concept.	2.264290096723266
Several pathomechanisms as increased cytokine synthesis, proliferative and proaggregatory effects could transmit the effects of chronic C. pneumoniae infection.	2.066458363349083
Animal models and first clinical trials using antibiotic therapy seem to support an etiological role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease.	2.0130865101038955
In this paper the current knowledge of the role of C- pneumoniae in coronary artery disease is reviewed and possible pathomechanisms are discussed.	2.4269994597565177
Preeclampsia is a disorder specific to pregnancy which can affect all maternal organs.	2.139216289477371
Cerebral involvement with the occurence of convulsions is the defining factor for eclampsia.	2.099339280194581
The most prominent signs of cerebral dysfunction include headache, hyperreflexia, visual disturbances, confusion and/or altered state of consciousness.	2.04991409527522
Patients usually recover completely however some patients remain disabled due to cerebrovascular damage.	1.9819501934390498
Intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhage are severe however rare complications of eclampsia.	2.1340027245310207
TCD investigations regularly find vasospasm in all great cerebral arteries.	2.161119595810243
Reversible hypodense lesions in the white matter on early CT-scans and increased signal intensities on T2-weighted MRT images indicate local edema.	1.9892857980090828
The etiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia remains unknown and its current pathophysiology is still hypothetical.	2.020823422019354
This article reviews the surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability.	2.487177296115409
The treatment rationale includes exact definition of the instability pattern ("envelope-of-motion" of the tibia) by clinical examination, arthrometry and stress radiography.	2.2376075036708905
Exact evaluation of the osseous anatomy is mandatory to identify an eventual varus morphotype.	2.380568747061201
This osseous variant in combination with posterior/posterolateral instability should be treated by an osteotomy in every case.	2.5020983689922125
The technique of additive osteotomy to correct varus and increase the sagittal tilt of the proximal tibia is described.	2.055677201232299
Ligament reconstruction in chronic posterior knee instability must address the posterior cruciate ligament and the lateral/posterolateral structures in many cases.	2.166591957027867
Patellar tendon grafts, quadriceps tendon grafts or hamstrings can be used for posterior cruciate ligament replacement.	2.4899102971518987
Arthroscopic or mini-open techniques may be used for graft placement, direct posterior fixation of the graft via a posterior incision is an option for patellar tendon grafts.	2.2110403915475816
Bousquet's biceps plasty or Clancy's biceps tenodesis may be used for posterolateral stabilization; a biceps tendon strip can also be used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction.	2.1239892319500218
Results of surgery are still moderate.	2.531957310925599
In the author's series of chronic posterior/posterolateral instability, 26 cases were treated with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and biceps tenodesis.	2.364209058898399
Presently, surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability should be restricted to centers devoted to this problem.	2.4907367025951395
This article reviews the current state of consensus reached for the diagnosis of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of conventional histopathological and immunohistochemical methods for inflammatory infiltrates in addition to molecular biological methods for persistence of viral genome in endomyocardial biopsies.	2.056463479960254
Health policy in Germany has in recent years given priority to the self-administration of physicians, sickness funds, and hospital associations.	2.1080820273318857
Hence, legal regulations on quality assurance have focused on defining responsibilities and areas of primary importance, while precise processes are being defined by the self-administration.	1.9081859692068848
As prices for health care are increasingly restricted by lump sum payments, quality and quality assurance become more important as a factor in competition between health care providers.	1.9657675453018728
To support the implementation of quality assurance in the health care system, the German Federal Ministry of Health has funded model-projects, e.g., to support the adaptation of successful strategies of total quality management for health care.	2.260327069626434
The research field of tissue engineering combines cells biology, biomaterial science, and surgery.	2.0739111202115508
Major long-term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients' own cells.	2.600704942004773
Our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues.	2.3304484104340304
The practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three-dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems.	2.018683644542343
The tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin, agarose, alginate, hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly -hydroxy acids (PLLA/PGLA).	1.704313163720868
Different technical approaches were established: a) three-dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b) interacting three-dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations, such as BMP-transfected mesenchymal cells.	2.2320787353418345
The preshaped artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre-formation step.	1.8897018885484322
Subsequently, pre-formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into 4mm articular joint defects of rabbits.	1.9208810387570068
Transplants were found to produce cartilage typic morphological patterns and matrix.	2.4009429439642975
80% of the transplants remained stable in vivo.	2.328684946409152
However, 20% of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue.	2.22266315407301
These results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction.	1.9991178709198563
The treatment of severe joint defects, however, faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies: (a) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints, (b) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation, and (c) the required enormous mechanical stability.	2.121776074626189
Background: Silicon-rubber central venous catheters have become commonplace in the care of premature infants.	2.1104931423970887
We report on a rare complication, fracture and cardiac embolization of a silicone-rubber catheter and its interventional retrieval.	1.9241467742112468
The ARO multicenter study intended to show clinical and radiological differences with regard to different systems of fixation and designs of the prothesis in total hip replacement in patients with hip dysplasia, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.	2.3142238670926996
In 1987 and 1988 5255 total hip prothesis were implanted by the 24 hospitals which took part in the study.	2.022464331006121
The follow-up period averaged 6.9 years.	2.526638755620312
The results of the Aro multicenter-study showed that despite difficult preoperative conditions especially in cases of rheumatoid arthritis the satisfaction rate improved remarkably.	2.0694083028568317
During the operation less complications arose in comparison to patients with hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis.	2.3325699433117135
Regarding the rate of infection after operation there were no differences between the 3 groups.	2.949995588939575
Only the rate of postoperative luxation concerning rheumatoid patients turned out to be twice the number of the others.	2.594565467870525
In our opinion this is due to the fact that these rheumatics were operated by posterior approach.	2.3439515448912016
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were satisfied most with their surgeries.	2.2073825192341
Results of rheumatic patients according to Harris hip score were slightly worse than the results of the two other groups.	2.4430504411653238
As a result of the study there were no differences in using cemented or cementless techniques for rheumatic hip replacement.	2.321018687579525
The decision for the method of fixation should depend on the patient's ability to relief the prothesis after operation.	2.330405893789866
The study has shown that cementless implantation can also be used for young rheumatics provided that a suitable design of prothesis will be selected.	2.070521849320056
Sepsis developing on the basis of a postoperative infection is a rare, but life-threatening event.	2.7789973174309437
Early diagnosis of postoperative complications usually facilitates decisive intervention and a favorable prognosis.	2.170048052622016
If the right moment is missed, endothelial damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and generalized systemic infection (SIRS).	2.0793324751445836
For the subsequentially developing septic shock, often combined with multiple organ failure (MOF), it is not important whether the starting point was an uncontrollable infections focus, ischemic damage following hypovolemic shock, or massive bacterial translocation with postoperative bowel obstruction.	1.8569855613617428
The collapse of the immune system results in immune paralysis and explains the inability of the organism to defend itself against systemic infections.	1.9572260080949841
For early recognition of the developing septic complication and its effective treatment, pathophysiological and clinical issues are discussed.	2.0473759179806037
The comparison of prediction of mortality and sepsis by different score systems was the objective of this retrospective study in 51 patients.	2.2005341645251226
Specific scores for burned patients - "Abbreviated Burn Severity Index" (ABSI) and the "Baltimore Sepsis Scale" (BSS) were compared with the general intensive score systems: "Mortality Prediction Model" (MPM II), "Simplified Acute Physiology Score" (SAPS II), APACHE II (ApII), "Hannover Intensive Score" (HIS) and the sepsis score developed by Elebute and Stoner (ES).	1.8066309842377193
On days 1 and 3 the true-positive ratio (sensitivity) was plotted against false-positive ratio (1-specifity) for each score.	2.12188304625178
The area under the curve (max.	2.30977931972593
0.5) correlates with the quality of the score system.	2.998575771749669
We also tested the discrimination of septic and nonseptic patients by using the different scores.	2.236461211511075
Bilateral symmetric changes in the cerebral hemispheric white matter are found with increasing frequency using CT and MRI techniques.	2.4096905484226196
These unspecific canges of the white matter signal are often called leukoaraiosis.	2.1265381833025936
These changes are found with increasing frequency in persons older than 60 years and also patients with dementia and cerebrovascular diseases.	2.042410008635906
The pathogenesis, clinical significance and morphological substrate are unclear.	2.244190060334603
The aim of this review is to summarise the actual knowledge about the etiology and clinical signs and symptoms found in patients with leukoaraiosis.	2.654611745716983
This term should not be used when white matter changes are found in patients younger than 35 years, with an unilateral onset, asymmetric distribution, and extensive changes all over the infra- and supratentorial white matter area.	2.041653942208428
Neuroradiological and clinical criteria are given to differentiate between leukoaraiosis and diseases of the white matter, especially enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, lacunar infarction, subcortical arteriosclerotic angiopathy (Binswanger's disease), leukoencephalopathy of different origin, and demyelinating diseases.	1.863637607561383
A case with various skeletal abnormalities, soft tissue masses and skin lesions diagnosed as Proteus syndrome is reported.	1.982832690287136
Proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders, because of the polymorphous nature of its clinical manifestations.	2.5035512983867934
It is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems.	2.9139356177002265
Early diagnosis and careful follow-up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long-term complications.	2.6665231548574373
The value of elective PTA in stenoses of the supraaortic vessels and especially of the carotid artery is still under discussion.	2.2066626546081896
Stenoses after surgical and/or radiation therapy and a high cardio-vascular risk for a surgical procedure, however, justify minimal-invasive techniques.	2.6357725749863277
Profiles of fundamental frequency sound pressure levels and voice duration are measured separately in clinical practice.	2.183488646345648
It was the aim of the present study to combine the two examinations, in order to estimate the relationship between pitch, sound pressure level and voice duration and to develop a new computer-assisted graph.	2.354821625060592
A three-dimensional (3D) wireframe phonogram was constructed based on SPL profiles to obtain a general view of the parameters recorded.	2.1500475071659793
We have termed this "phonetography".	2.405752339393429
Variable further projections were selected for the analysis of different aspects of parametric relationships.	2.324534647258851
The results in 21 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with hyperfunctional dysphonias demonstrated that there were three typical figures of the 3D phonograms produced, depending on the relationship between voice duration when soft ("piano") compared to loud ("forte").	1.89722295506028
In one-third of the healthy volunteers, the values of the piano voice duration were greater than those of forte for almost all pitches examined.	2.1704953494726813
In two-thirds of the healthy subjects the values of forte voice duration were partly greater, as were those of piano voice duration.	1.982679013798305
All of the patients showed voice duration values greater for forte than for piano.	2.373830755164329
Sinus histiocytosis is as a rule a benign disease of lymph nodes, infiltrated by large histiocytes.	2.3864969102992486
These cells show typical cytophagocytosis, particularly lymphophagocytosis.	2.214802592686884
Other organs may be also involved by this disease, often including the skin.	2.1684336925232204
Exclusive cutaneous sinus histiocytosis without infiltration of lymph nodes seems to be very rare.	2.773872906947364
To exclude other non-X histiocytoses or histiocytosis-X, it is advisable to use immunohistochemistry.	2.3003580364347185
We report on a patient with sinus histiocytosis and discuss the problems of differential diagnosis.	2.21349251512667
The case of a five-year-old girl with intractable fluor vaginalis and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported.	2.2311100724774287
A presacral dermoid cyst was shown to be the cause of these symptoms.	2.871460618294445
After verification of the anatomical situation, an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out.	2.554147864738819
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive functional method for the study of solid tumor perfusion, metabolism and interaction with different therapeutic agents.	2.337497376475818
The aim of the study was the investigation of the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and the kinetics during a treatment with intratumoral ethanol by PET.	2.151381801313831
The ongoing study includes seven patients with child A cirrhosis and HCC (UICC stage III-IVA; tumor size 3-6 cm).	1.9584686434266618
The evaluation of the FDG data demonstrated a liver-equivalent uptake in six of the tumors (well and moderately differentiated HCC), which were poorly delineated against the normal liver parenchyma.	2.169750403665253
One moderately differentiated HCC showed an increased FDG metabolism, indicating no correlation between histology and metabolism.	2.15918642676598
Five out of seven tumors demonstrated a high 11C uptake shortly after the end of the ethanol injection followed by constant 11C-ethanol concentration during the whole study period of 45 min.	1.9805304660687657
The PET data demonstrated no significant elimination of the 11C-ethanol from the tumor and no accumulation in the surrounding liver tissue.	2.1023965101043998
One case showed a decrease of the intratumoral 11C-ethanol concentration due to a punkture of a tumor vein, and in another case the surrounding liver parenchyma demonstrated significant 11C uptake in the early phase following paratumoral injection of the drug.	2.2354208074729986
In conclusion, PET is a useful tool for the study of the mechanism and the kinetics of percutaneous intratumoral ethanol injection of HCC.	2.221237496305758
During the last decade, many investigations were conducted in order to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	2.3262216773235393
However, the increasing knowledge, instead of clarification, leads us to realize that these terms may assemble a wide variety of lung pathologies.	1.8127331599273542
Indeed, many circumstances can result in these syndromes and no particular factor has been defined to distinguish ARDS of one etiology from another.	1.985377688558803
We are still ignorant about which factors lead to the extended inflammation from pneumonia to ARDS, while it is not clear whether the timing of events are determined by some mediators.	2.086480294136761
Furthermore, in the clinical arena, there is no clear distinction between pneumonia, severe pneumonia which may lead to ALI and then ARDS.	2.582766371999391
Finally, the results of all these studies should have allowed us to investigate new therapeutical approaches while none seems to emerge.	2.2009594117052624
This review is an analysis by an ICU clinician of the different points of view of these syndromes and intends to give a global vision of the numerous factors implied, emphasizing the complex interactions between them.	1.9463432742255506
The present state about new potential treatments directed on mediators is summarized.	1.9666915350443217
The aim of the study was to evaluate if a combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS = Marburger Intensive Score) offers better outcome prediction compared to scoring systems, which are based either only physiologically (APACHE II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) or only therapeutically (TISS = Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) in medical intensive care medicine.	1.7711304960937169
Main outcome parameters employed were hospital mortality, severity of disease classification and length of hospital stay.	2.194021747716976
During a 12-months period (1993/94), 531 consecutive patients (ICU stay >4 hours) being admitted to a medical ICU of a tertiary care university hospital were prospectively investigated.	1.9230865930587215
The day-1-scores of MARIS, APACHE II, and TISS were determined and the patients were followed until hospital discharge or death.	2.410245789458867
There was no advantage in using the combined scoring system (MARIS) neither in discrimination between survival and non-survival (hospital mortality; areas under the ROC-curve: MARIS = 0.84, APACHE II = 0.86, TISS = 0.78) nor in severity classification (relationship between day-1-scores and hospital mortality: p<0.001 (chi2-Test) in all three systems).	1.7519427619488113
In contrast only for the combined system (MARIS), a dependence of length of hospital stay from day-1-scores in the analysis of survivors only and in the analysis of all patients (survivors and non-survivors) (p<0.001; ANOVA) could be demonstrated.	2.5829123994783703
In conclusion the combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS) did not offer a better outcome prediction concerning hospital mortality and severity classification compared to the established systems in critically ill patients.	1.9782004900283148
Its use may be advantageous in evaluating the relationship between day-1-scores and length of hospital stay, which for economical reasons has become a parameter of growing interest in intensive care medicine.	2.117990160110547
A 23 month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia, mainly truncal rash and unclear pain.	1.9826049092377473
Previously he had shown fever, conjunctivitis and desquamations of hands and feet.	2.0647009811404256
Laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and an elevation of ESR and gamma-globulins.	2.0565436795011935
No bacterial infection was found.	2.658744988901612
The ECG showed signs of a myocardial ischemia.	2.6743217051970647
The sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery.	3.113178407037972
The boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest.	2.375315133620974
The autopsy verified the diagnosis of Kawasaki-syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis.	2.137034102025742
The etiology of the painful hip in children is widespread.	2.3656462301107273
In this paper, predominants cases without previous trauma are discussed in detail.	2.097888379093989
Depending on age, history, clinical picture and laboratory results, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is presented, which should avoid unnecessary tests and lead to the necessary therapeutic measure.	2.1936766833825714
Several common as well as uncommon clinical entities are illustrated by representative examples.	2.6116185077987772
The present study exemplifies the method of quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) by quantifying, in bovine tissues, the specific mRNAs for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) -receptor and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.	1.8200327751431646
Our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mRNAs.	2.133003106426447
The LDL-receptor mRNA expression was highest in the adrenal gland (6.7 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the corpus luteum of the ovary, intermediate in the liver (8.6 x 102 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and not detectable in the large intestine.	1.761458705785787
Expression of the HMG-CoA reductase almost paralleled LDL-receptor values.	2.080898447725296
It was found to be highest in the ovary (6.1 x 106 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the adrenal gland, intermediate in the liver (3.1 x 105 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and lowest in the large intestine (9.9 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA).	1.7530164939399786
These data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches.	2.216982495965678
Thus cRT-PCR is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the LDL-receptor and the HMG-CoA reductase.	2.3577592104666407
Spinal opioids are effective analgesics for surgical and non-surgical pain.	2.4236438295485905
Central and systemic side effects are less frequent than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioids.	2.3401468204615568
This review focuses on the analgesic efficacy of spinal opioids and their combination with local anaesthetics for postoperative analgesia, including patient-controlled epidural analgesia.	2.0767516069781204
Intrathecal administration of opioids has some advantages over their administration by the epidural route.	2.1522505584827387
Thoracic epidural administration of opioids seems to have no clinically important advantages over the lumbar route in terms of quality of analgesia, adverse effects, doses required or pulmonary function.	2.275748133045226
However, evidence suggesting that effective postoperative analgesia can significantly improve postoperative morbidity in patients at risk is accumulating.	2.1585067402746385
In such patients, combined use of epidural local anaesthetics and opioids may become the technique of choice for postoperative analgesia.	2.3979848483398203
However, there is no evidence that this would have any clinically relevant benefit in low-risk patients.	2.3078505682557693
This contribution summarizes a discussion of several experts on the field of clinical nutrition, which was held in Evangelische Akademie Loccum, Germany, May 20-21, 1998.	2.174262265006229
Nutrition can be considered a medical treatment, which justifies assessment of benefits according to outcome parameters.	2.387437362428326
With regard to nutritional support of the cancer patient, evaluation of quality of life (QL) is more appropriate than morbidity and survival related parameters.	2.1315361861063593
Quality of life is a multidimensional construct which can be measured by standardized questionnaires.	2.2965425360368723
The QL Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), is an established and validated instrument which provides reliable information with regard to disease-related limitations of QL.	2.175303367985017
The measurement of QL can be extended by appropriate modules for specific problems according to the underlying cancer disease and special therapies (e.g., percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy).	2.0164914326693846
In the individual case, the interpretation of the role of nutritional parameters for QL may be confounded by other parameters, such as disease or personal changes.	2.4376785822913267
However, the information supports decision making about the indication, the route of nutritional therapy, as well as individual follow-up.	2.4041415310955916
Using QL as an outcome parameter, carefully designed prospective trials might be feasible in order to investigate the outcome of nutritional therapy in patients with advanced cancer.	2.732725090380262
The treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative.	2.7073248673276495
The immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments, with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist.	2.1710980064663885
A graduated treatment scheme based on the ASIF classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur.	2.560839512223137
The majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means; operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement.	2.025824799377376
The authors' own patient population is presented in this paper: in these patients fixation with Kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used, followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty, and for C-type fractures according to the ASIF classification or when there is severe soft-tissue damage, application of a fixateur externe spanning the joint has proved best.	2.2722718892681617
Treatment strategy, risks, complications and results are presented.	2.624752397996027
Many couples have to cope with periods of involuntary childlessness and they often ask for medical help.	1.9890458230256247
In the Heidelberg Project of involuntary childlessness in men, andrological patients were surveyed from the time before diagnosis till the end of 1 year's andrological treatment.	1.9405178695256327
Cardiac complications remain an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality with noncardiac surgery, despite improvement in surgical techniques and anaesthetic management.	2.2069689641088224
Therefore preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment plays a pivotal role in management of patients prior to noncardiac surgery.	2.0730745601359106
Thorough history-taking and careful examination are essential to consider further diagnostic steps in order to predict the patient's individual perioperative cardiac risk as accurately as possible.	2.216776950391864
Besides elaboration of medical therapy, cardiac catherization and even balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery must be considered if indicated by preoperative cardiac testing.	2.066609128934167
The etiology of the instability are ligamentous damage and functional neuromuscular disorder of the peroneal muscles.	2.2699895665778826
Newer diagnostic methods, up to now not well established in clinical routine, include stabilometry, cybex-measurements of the pronator muscles, the evaluation of peroneal reaction time on a tilting platform and dynamic pedography.	2.096556266111745
Conservative management of chronic ankle instability consists of wearing ankle braces and rehabilitation programs concerned with peroneal muscle strengthening and coordination training.	1.8384950106284788
The indication for surgical reconstruction of the ankle ligaments are a well-documented mechanical instability with the neuromuscular reflexes intact and a failed physiotherapeutic training program.	2.2197989488054604
The surgical procedure should be selected according to a priority list: 1. anatomical repair, eventually augmented with periosteum from the fibula, 2.	1.9775216543969647
Watson-Jones tenodesis, and 3.	2.632479327666489
Chrisman-Snook tenodesis to treat a concomittant subtalar instability.	2.09547884711792
No other disease has exhibited such a significant influence on the behaviour of health care workers (HCW) as the AIDS pandemic.	2.1570682234788077
Numerous epidemiological data, however, have proven that the overall risk of transmission of the human deficiency virus (HIV) during surgical interventions is low; it is 0.3 % for all types of percutaneous exposures.	2.1940351017677684
Nevertheless, there still is a need for wider adoption of safer surgical techniques to reduce the chances of HIV transmission in the operation theatre, which additionally minimize the risk of transmission of other blood-borne pathogens.	2.1291619488268774
In the case of occupational exposure to HIV-contaminated blood or body secretions post-exposure prophylaxis should be recommended stratified by the type of exposure and source material.	1.9788767162384995
Abstract   Pachyonychia congenita (PC) comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited conditions showing characteristic nail thickening and associated signs such as palmoplantar keratoderma, follicular keratoses, and mucosal leukokeratoses.	1.7285467680918623
Less frequently epidermal cysts, hairshaft abnormalities, natal teeth and laryngeal involvement may be seen.	2.0082013419107425
Phenotypically and genetically two major forms of PC are recognized, pachyonychia congenita Jadassohn- Lewandowsky/PC type I (Medelian inheritance in man - MIM - 167200) and pachyonychia congenita Jackson-Lawler/PC type II (MIM 167210).	1.7006397546843108
Both conditions show nail deformities, focal palmoplantar keratoderma, and follicular hyperkeratoses.	2.051733192261606
In contrast individuals affected with PC type II show premature dentition and multiple pilosebaceous cysts predominantely affecting the upper trunk.	1.8546535749780477
The latter closely resemble eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex.	1.940655959636881
By mutational analysis keratin K6a and K16 gene mutations have been detected in patients with PC type I, and keratin K6b and K17 gene mutations have been shown to be the underlying genetic defect in patients with PC type II.	2.3737218491672927
We investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding, administration of blood products, and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem (DIL) administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective CABG.	2.233232766029621
We retrospectively analyzed the surgical and ICU records of CABG patients who had recieved DIL (27 pats.)	2.077590188409567
or nitroglycerin (NTG; 26 pats.)	2.291358595554549
or a combination thereof (COM; 25 pats.).	2.1997053925670182
Data investigated included the amount of postoperative chest tube bleeding (CTB), frequency of administration of packed red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and changes in hemoglobin (Hb), thrombocyte (Th) levels as well as changes in prothrombin- (PT) and partial thromboplastine time (PTT).	2.0111708814525104
There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to biometrical or operative data.	2.3182929138837527
The amount of CTB as well as the use of RBC and FFP were not significantly different between the groups.	2.664181663694587
Also, there were no significant differences with regard to Hb or Th and PT or PTT, both in the early phase after the operation in ICU as well as after 24 hours in the ICU.	2.613007548175896
The perioperative administration of the calcium entery blocker DIL reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during CABG surgery.	2.314575532365973
This administration during CABG surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding.	2.5593213077809276
As compared to NTG, DIL does not have negative effects on Hb and Th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first 24 hours in the ICU after CABG surgery.	2.032849041770239
Depression and fibromyalgia (FM) share common symptoms, indicating a close relationship between both disorders.	1.9914200865273577
FM patients frequently present symptoms of major depression.	2.398287904484699
Genetic epidemiological studies show that genetic transmission is one important component.	2.30339330578733
Molecular genetic studies are on the way; the serotonin transporter promoter gene seems to be associated with neurotic anxiety and FM.	2.1900667370715823
Biochemical studies related to the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are disturbed in both disorders.	2.2579611644539743
This view is supported by the response to treatment with antidepressants.	2.5501914713183367
At our hospital, closed dislocations of the elbow without neurovascular or osseous lesion are treated conservatively after successful reduction in the absence of a tendency to redislocation.	2.339719638490686
Indications for surgery are irreducible dislocations and those with a tendency to redislocation as well as open soft tissue injuries, neurovascular and osseous concomitant injuries.	2.357742440175273
During a period of 10 years 113 patients were treated according to this strategy.	2.6566123620604527
Of these patients, 46 had simple dislocations of the elbow and 67 suffered from dislocations with osseous lesions.	2.0230322907612024
In 95 patients follow-ups could be performed after a mean period of 55 months.	2.378669858272568
In more than 75 % of cases good or excellent functional results were documented; unfavourable results were seen only in patients with osseous lesions.	2.3844360184760616
Nearly all of the patients had a stable elbow joint at the end of therapy.	3.2033945767734
The present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding (PET) in the conjunctivae and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation.	2.1441978662441668
The highest frequencies were found in fire victims (31%), persons who had died after intensive care (24%), cardiac death (22%), drowning and intoxication (16% each).	1.9836001255695779
The frequency of PET decreased with increasing age and increased with the body mass.	2.2651555514689354
At first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) seemed to influence the occurrence of PET, because the rate was 11% without and 19% with CPR (x2: p < 0.05); an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature.	2.0954062907848345
However, further analysis showed that a higher rate of PET could only be observed in causes of death where PET are often fround irrespective of CPR, whereas in the other groups PET (with or without CPR) are uncommon.	2.279530349402388
Furthermore, a case-by-case analysis showed that in several cases with PET after CPR the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than CPR.	2.071021446801743
On the other hand, no statistically significant influence of CPR on the rate of PET could be found in this relatively homogeneous group.	2.334365914794651
Although objective data is lacking, the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in Germany, Austria, the southern Tirol, Switzerland and the Chamonix region in France were analysed with respect to the fatal and non-fatal accidents which occurred between 1987 and 1997.	2.0107685226923246
A 75-year-old man had painless, slowly enlarging tumors in the right and left infrascapular regions.	2.5069363020030533
Clinically, the tumors were nontender and semimobile.	2.2238266163129046
MR imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs.	1.9261108389199204
At surgery, the tumors were thought to be malignant, most likely liposarcomas.	2.5523586170168824
The histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers.	1.9510848313049995
Elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft-tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women.	2.2329206316358245
In 10 % of the patients bilateral, often asynchronous tumors are seen.	2.8230333333975524
Ninety-nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region.	2.5448683773582563
Occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities, head, and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities.	3.0429344856313025
The relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies.	2.251821511782118
Only case reports of one or more patients exist.	2.7586188859702694
Optimal therapy, therefore, remains controversial, and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given.	2.207933455230402
Nevertheless, in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred, if no contraindications exist.	2.040797102475049
Two cases are presented together with a literature review.	2.5857685004887427
The Comèl-Netherton syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease.	2.50779878430099
A 23-year old female presented with the classical triad of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, trichorrhexis invaginata with bamboo hairs of up to 12 cm length and atopic diathesis.	1.9721324597535674
Nevertheless, more than 20 years passed before the final diagnosis was established.	2.3790550231435836
In addition, the patient was slightly mentally retarded and suffered from a genital papillomatosis, minimal hypergammaglobulinaemia and a marked bilateral eyelid ectropion, more severe than previously reported.	2.043874220205356
Oral therapy with Acitretin was quite successful.	2.334304495049303
Background: Recent studies have shown the usefulness of pars plana vitrectomy with the use of growth factors in the treatment of macular holes.	2.9098388773388493
Autologous platelet concentrates contain many growth factors to stimulate glial wound healing.	2.0509693515284533
In vitro fertilisation IVF and intrazytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction.	2.099143082628384
Whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted, for example severe tubal damage which cannot be microsurgically repaired, cryptozoospermia, severe OAT syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal IVF, ICSI might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well.	1.8332539229240454
In this paper a number of additional ICSI indications are defined, for example minor forms of andrological subfertility, reinsemination of nonfertilised oocytes on the day after conventional IVF, reduced motility of cryopreserved sperms, reduced quality of oocytes or ICSI after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in IVF.	1.781471247537041
Load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation.	2.222877824114033
This stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury.	2.612961347138695
In the past, the development of shoe and surface materials has hardly been perceived under this aspect, but may be increasingly important in the future.	2.1926817080589878
With optimal clinical management of patients with Marfan syndrome, life expectancy may be improved substantially from 32 years to a nearly normal life span.	2.2770950087789132
Cornerstones of clinical management comprise genetic counseling, life-style management, and cardiovascular surveillance, which includes regular aortic imaging and endocarditis prophylaxis.	1.976385203522201
Prophylactic use of beta-blocking agents as well as timing of elective surgery and the choice of the optimal surgical technique are difficult issues that obviously need to be individualized.	2.4834235882435602
Juvenile or postoperative patients as well as pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome pose particular problems.	2.5493298434775205
This review intends both to facilitate differential decision making based on referenced evidence and to provide guidelines for therapeutic strategies.	1.9211832177710881
Finally, a review of the most recent advantages to somatic gene therapy is given.	2.702050179981626
In different animal investigations Pyrost demonstrated osteoconductive and osteostimulative effects.	2.002319064409928
In ectopic tissues and especially in conditions of low osteogenetic potency, the combination of Pyrost and autogenic bone marrow effects bone formation.	2.027094685814448
In Germany, good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed.	2.035806270279592
Good supranational industry-sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new (expensive) drugs.	1.9539567691390642
The preconditions for co-operation in conducting industry-independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community have been improved substantially in Germany by instituting the working group of co-operating arthritis centers, the so-called core documentation where 32000 patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in 1997 and the institution of a sophisticated information system ("RheumaNet").	1.8677286368781176
The executive board of the German Rheumatology Association has set up an "ad hoc commission" that agreed to institute a "Committee for the Coordination of Clinical Studies in Rheumatic Diseases".	1.76117768226904
In this committee rheumatologists subspecialized from medicine, orthopedic, pediatrics working in universities, hospitals and private practice as well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented.	1.9994079413285726
In principle this committee is independent of the co-operating arthritis centers and the RheumaNet.	2.12666619696298
All members of the German Rheumatology Association are invited to cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important questions and participating in clinical studies.	2.0737559453513166
The committee has to define key questions in rheumatology and shall plan and organize multicenter studies to answer these questions.	1.864087652884625
In addition, study protocols of pharmaceutical companies may be examined as to their importance, quality, and feasibility.	1.9677791303280376
Abnormal uterine bleeding is a gynecological problem frequently seen in women from adolescence to the postmenopausal period.	2.027278930924216
According to the "speed"-hypothesis of cognitive development, the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence.	1.9452057908382407
The present study investigates the "speed"-hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using Latent Growth Curve Methodology.	1.9239926435575285
Date on 4 measurement points come from the Bonn Longitudinal Study of aging (N=128, mean age 67.2, 53% women).	1.899015378049446
Based on principal factor analysis, markers of mental speed were the WAIS Digit Symbol Test and simple psychomotor task.	1.8417421301857708
As indicators of fluid intelligence the WAIS Object Assembly and Block Design were used.	1.9736851355609988
After separately fitting Latent Growth Curve Models for the trajectory of mental speed and fluid intelligence, a combined model showed no statistically significant improvement of fit for freeing the covariance between the two slope-factors.	1.9062486487211727
Interpreting this result, contrary to the "speed"-hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed.	1.9060163642393915
For patients with dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the prognosis is highly unfavorable, even under conditions of optimal medication.	2.3570813209368136
At present, there is no option for causal therapy.	2.6969384600894255
Since there is increasing evidence that modifications of the immune system accompanied by the production of autoantibodies, e.g., against 1 ad-renergic or muscarinergic receptors, are involved in the pathogenesis of DCM, the elucidation of the possible functional significance of these autoantibodies has attracted increasing interest.	2.0579231585747833
In addition to the role of autoantibodies as markers for an autoimmune process, discussion of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms has centered on direct toxicity as well as on negative influencing of myocardial contractility and energy metabolism.	2.170981147321635
The effects gained through removal of autoantibodies by immunoadsorption therapy for DCM patients sheds light on the functional importance of autoantibodies in this syndrome.	1.9034705686835605
The principle of this form of therapy is based on the binding of circulating antibodies to sepharose columns, to which polyclonal antibodies against human immunoglobulin are linked.	2.1374892875286937
These results may be interpreted as indicating that autoantibodies play an active role in DCM and that their removal by immunadsorption possibly represents a highly promising future therapeutic concept.	1.8313473001363065
Active unspecific immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting has been shown to enhance survival in melanoma patients, and gene therapy now offers new perspectives for active specific immunotherapy.	2.0826952094172433
Gene therapy includes the transfer of genetic material performed by either viral or non-viral methods and in vivo or ex vivo.	2.0956172868030416
For melanoma the following approaches are suggested: vaccination with tumour-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or `naked DNA', vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T-lymphocytes or transfected tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma.	1.6547969674878371
Since 1995, a total of 115 patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment.	2.063669540741344
After the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment.	2.4253092603682074
The mean follow-up period for all patients was 31 months (range 3-50 months.	2.468611394132281
In 87 cases (75.7%) bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms.	2.1961974649771725
Apart from low-grade local reactions (swelling, haematoma, petechiae) no complications were observed.	2.138660858294732
The treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology.	2.1864604135071404
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing.	2.359692470932343
The sound transmission properties of three different commercially available middle ear implants and the prototype of a complete middle ear prosthesis (CoMEP) were evaluated with a special measurement system that permits standardized conditions.	2.0370176749275357
This system uses a mechanical middle ear model (MMM) which approximates the impedances of the tympanic membrane and inner ear.	1.8881148895962454
The implants were fitted under defined conditions into the MMM.	2.254104805125105
Displacement of the artificial stapes footplate of the MMM was measured with an optical probe.	2.220324462485762
The measurements of different middle ear prostheses showed that the mass of the implant was the most important factor for optimum high frequency transmission.	2.551917528337579
The lightest implant (4 mg, titanium) showed the best results.	2.2951173154840543
The CoMEP revealed the highest sensitivity because of a slight enlargement of the diameter of the artificial tympanic membrane.	2.405106917484125
These findings show that the CoMEP is able to restore sound transmission to a normal range.	2.3675619248629323
In a second experiment one of the implants was fitted into the MMM with different forces.	2.425651016477023
The increase of stiffness produced a slightly better high frequency transmission at the expense of low frequency sensitivity.	2.0273270905196576
Hence, the fitting of the implant may not be too stiff because of its loss of mobility within a significant frequency range.	2.201002850104977
Angiomyolipomas are hamartomas that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis (M. Bourneville-Pringle).	2.000373047934732
Clinically, this long-term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass.	2.312341983715811
Due to the high percentage of fat components in this tumor type, computed tomography is far superior to other radiological procedures.	2.1486703881942177
The excact pathogenesis of Peyronie's Disease (PD) is still unknown.	2.214218770241072
Histopathological investigations suggest, that the metabolism of the collogenious tissue plays an important role.	2.426716871943526
Therefore, we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of 11 patients with PD and 11 healthy controls.	2.6742852721380355
We mesured biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood, wich correspond to the collagen metabolism (procollagen III [P III P], PMN-elastase [PMN-E], fibronectin [FN], fibronectinreceptor [FN-R] und -1-proteinase-inhibitor [-1-PI]).	1.8369965773212096
There was no difference in PMN-E, P III P, FN and FN-R in all samples.	1.83628798628577
There was no difference in penile and venous blood as well.	2.149896887786349
But we found out a highly significant lower concentration of -1-PI in patients with PD (158,55 mg/dl) than in controls (214,82 mg/dl).	2.4274516748270236
Closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare.	2.9452163035244183
Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature, perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor.	2.659903260294565
Clinically, the tendon rupture presents as acute weakness of the ankle extensors without reddening, swelling or neurological signs.	2.0767240318251554
Differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded.	2.075740832899436
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination.	2.3554100775658187
An operation may be undertaken up to 3 months after the injury.	2.3955231967951622
Preferred procedures are end-to-end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon, followed by a plaster cast for 6 weeks postoperatively.	2.455733847269654
High-risk patients can be treated conservatively, but the functional results are less satisfactory.	3.0459025372973296
We describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon.	2.883816758428961
A yet unpublished method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented.	2.3026453764166055
In this four-part review article, an update of Psychological Gerontology since 1988 in German speaking countries is given.	1.863821091788294
Part II of this review focuses an personality development in old age.	2.4441575035670895
In accordance with their current relevance within research on personality development, concepts and empirical studies concerned with coping, psychological resilience and development regulation in old age are addressed in the first part of this review (contributions to basic research).	1.9469102922921528
First, research based on the two-process-model of coping, the personality theory of Thomae and the life-span theory of control is summarized.	2.1871956175212395
Next, work on subjective well-being, self and self-regulation are highlighted.	2.297884146773759
In the second part of the review (contribution to applied research), an overview of the scope of potential of psychotherapeutic intervention in old age is given.	2.2453020229717344
Background: According to literature, 30-60 % of pacemaker patients suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).	2.274904468796569
As rapid tracking of PAF may cause severe symptoms in patients with dual chamber pacemakers, refined algorithms providing AV synchronous pacing during periods of sinus rhythm and preventing high ventricular rates during PAF are highly desirable.	1.9663506999272653
Aim and method: This comprehensive paper introduces a new mode switching (MS) algorithm which uses either a fixed (Inos2CLS) or programmable (Logos) number of short intervals out of 8 consecutive atrial intervals to detect PAF.	1.716112875888855
If the MS criterion is fulfilled, a switch from AV synchronous pacing to nontracking mode is automatically performed.	1.890053152837544
The algorithm is described together with a discussion on optimization of the programming of parameters which may indirectly influence the MS sensitivity and specificity.	2.0297219167036817
Results: This MS concept maintains the high sensitivity and fast reactivity towards PAF of the "mode conversion" in Actros and Kairos pacemaker systems, preventing a long time delay between onset of PAF, detection of the arrhythmia, and switch to nontracking mode.	1.8950681041448814
In addition, adequeate sensing and short blanking periods in the new MS concept enable reliable MS.	1.8721715418975102
The occurrence of atrial oversensing should be tested, as it may lead to inappropriate MS. Programmability of the MS algorithm may be advantageous for individual programming with respect to the patients' arrhythmia rate and atrial sensing performance, but the use of very restrictive or very liberal criteria should be avoided as both may lead to mode oscillations.	2.271832002219283
Finally, examples of stored diagnostic data are presented to assess MS reliability, identify possible problems, and optimize MS function during follow-up.	1.9998644828207273
A number of infectious agents has been newly detected in the last 10 years.	2.4669469119696115
Climatic hanges and migration have been the most important factors in the emergence of new and old infections.	2.4469915220322758
Additionally, new methods for the detection of DNA and RNA have played an important role in the detection of agents difficult to culture.	2.56285504817888
So far medical requirements for aviators have been defined by national licensing authorities.	2.0340776672383125
For a long while ophthalmological problems, insufficiencies in vision, refraction or color vision, have been responsible for approximately 50 % of rejection of applicants for medical reasons.	1.842676049817541
Introduction: Coronary arterty disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world.	2.3269752634135594
Although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography (SCA) is beyond dispute, the associated risk of an invasive approach, the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non-invasive techniques for coronary imaging.	2.1498021683340838
Intravenous coronary angiography (ICA) has been shown to permit non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	2.9848955410335885
We report nine case histories of patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for severe somatic disorders.	2.1131468297549487
The somatic disease was either the cause of the psychiatric symptomatology, or it occurred in addition to a well-known psychiatric disorder.	2.561461541806874
For general practitioners and psychiatrists it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms due to psychiatric disorders and symptoms that indicate somatic disorders.	2.2932873774413394
If patients refuse the necessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and show behaviour that is not related to good health, there is increased risk for complications and increased morbidity.	2.372730784544456
Penetrating neck injuries are potentially life-threatening injuries.	2.530487022646713
Management is controversial despite decades of discussion in the literature.	2.2453006701840166
An algorithm for diagnosis and therapy is needed because of the potential risk of mortality.	2.7747531101505114
In the Department of Trauma Surgery of Vienna Medical School, mandatory surgical exploration after noninvasive investigations is practiced.	2.0256002222527596
Thirty-one patients with this kind of injury were treated between August 1992 and September 1999.	2.133288979432096
Injuries were caused in seven cases by gunshots, in eight cases by broken glass, in one case by an iron rod, in one case by a spear, in one case by a branch and in 13 cases the penetrating injuries were stab wounds caused by knives.	1.8665752366082258
Complications like pseudoaneurysms and fistulas were not seen.	2.291153488973125
No patient came to death.	2.5612125593734096
During a 18-year-period 93 patients (f=76, m=17) with a factitious disorder were identified in the psychiatric consultation service of a university hospital (incidence: 0.62%).	2.154027298990297
50% of women were working in medical professions whereas only 6% of men.	2.1445673456192127
There was a classical Munchhausen syndrome in 11% of patients.	2.2358468625632875
Depressive and anxiety disorders (10%, 4%) were to be respected as psychiatric comorbidity.	2.4073888109406276
Ca 25% of the patients suffered from a somatic illness in addition to the factitious disorder, and one third of the women had symptoms of psychosomatic, especially of eating disorders.	2.7224199406968315
Previous somatoform disorders, deliberate self harm and attempts of suicide were to be noted in the psychiatric history of many patients.	2.0477965279816317
There were frequent traumatizing events (foster home, disturbing family disharmony, physical and sexual abuse, early losses, serious illnesses) in the early biography.	1.999611091013193
Various psychosocial stressors could be identified in the actual eliciting situation.	2.4921187718610813
The results are discussed in respect of epidemiology, development and clinical phenomenology of factitious disorders, psychodynamics and psychopathology of deception and self harm, and therapeutic options in the psychiatric consultation service.	1.8976292098508671
In a long-term follow-up we evaluated 40 patients out of 55 (73 %) with a subtalar fusion.	2.508164899672096
The operations took place from 5/84 to 5/91.	2.143799625497789
In all cases the indication for the fusion was a post-traumatic arthritis after an intra-articular os calcis fracture.	2.332689209332227
The evaluation of the overall results was carried out with three different scoring systems: a.	2.7804613364280417
The Outcome-questionnaire, rating patient's complaints and the functional status based on the severity-symptom scale and functional status described for Carpaltunnel-syndrome by Levine et al.	2.0228501095925173
c. The clinical rating system (CRS) described by Kitaoka et al.	2.063019768007788
The statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).	2.191113541824624
Level of significance was based on P = 0.05 and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient.	2.254670222627565
The Os calcis fracture was the cause for the subtalar arthritis in all 40 patients (33 males and 7 females).	2.0688239216010853
The primary treatment of the calcaneal fracture was conservative (cons.)	2.386566076993194
using a plaster in 23 patients (57.5 %), while 17 patients (42.5 %) underwent open reduction and plate fixation (op.).	2.182442169161489
The interval between trauma and subtalar fusion averaged 3.5 years (3 months to 20 years).	2.1610970761961683
The interval between subtalar fusion and follow-up averaged 5.2 years (4-14 years).	2.4286287889939064
The mean age at the time of reexamination was 47 years (26-61 years).	2.120258620199243
In the present study, complete pain relief could be achieved in 21 (52.5 %; 58 % op., 50 % cons.)	2.063742337735551
A relevant restriction in the range of motion in the ankle joint was found in 26 (65 %; 76 % op., 58 % cons.).	2.495808059609556
In 23 patients (62 %; 65 % op., 59 % cons.)	2.326460185269399
the radiological evaluation revealed a grade 1  ° arthritis of the ankle joint, in the talonavicular joint in 17 patients (42.5 %; 41 % op., 45 % cons.	2.360276920534951
), and in the calcaneo-cuboid joint in 14 patients (35 %; 47 %., 27 % cons.).	2.7336938031410827
The statistical analysis revealed a better outcome in the operative group compared with the conservative group, although the operated os calcis fractures in the majority were the more severe fracture types.	2.5321248638044147
In all evaluation systems a score between 61 and 69 points could be achieved with no significant difference between the operatively and conservatively treated groups and between the newly developed questionaire and the clinical-radiological scoring systems.	2.0669115756770475
For the questionaire this fulfills the requirements for a reliable outcome evaluation.	2.147989680349329
Objectives Correction of an overriding fifth toe.	2.250764854364336
Non-palpable breast-lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis.	2.0326874128078427
Accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since freehand positionin of al localization wire is often suboptimal.	1.8677365026703052
The consequences are larger tissue-defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result.	2.146347298176447
Nevertheless, resection of microcalcifications by conventional surgery remains sometimes incomplete.	2.2434676155617144
Digital mammography coupled with stereotactic biopsy procedures gives more accurate results with minimal invasive techniques.	1.995932852394867
The advantages and disadvantages of the advanced breast biopsy intstrumentation (ABBI) procedure versus vacuum biopsy systems are summarized and compared.	1.8499591432372875
Either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the methods.	2.4586714168631496
Chondroid syringoma belongs to the group of so-called mixed tumors, like pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal and salivary glands.	2.3957936987785646
The histogenesis of this tumour is still disputed, in particular with respect to its stromal component.	2.668941314432375
The distribution of cytokeratins (CKs), CEA, EMA, vimentin, S-100 protein, desmin and actin [-smooth muscle actin (-SMA)] was investigated by immunohistological examination of paraffin sections from a chondroid syringoma of the apocrine type.	1.7500029365848417
The neoplastic formations have been classified into tubuloalveolar structures, solid nests/aggregations and stromal cells of varying morphology.	1.8724574782883454
The innermost cells of tubuloalveolar structures were characterized by marked expression of CKs (KL1 and MNF116), CEA and EMA, while in the outer ones there was moderate expression of vimentin, S-100 was expressed to a lesser extent and KL1, weakly but there was marked and consistent expression of MNF116.	1.7955250531554794
Anti--SMA specifically detects myoepithelial cells.	2.179518956244089
In addition, the partly overlapping immunoreactivity of the intermediate filaments, membrane proteins and proteins in the different structures may indicate a common clonal origin of all neoplastic cells in chondroid syringoma.	1.7301810558824606
Leg ulcers may be caused by many different diseases.	2.579418977336486
Most frequently, they are due to vasculopathies, to a lesser extent to metabolic, neuropathic or hematologic diseases.	2.1712376230683956
Neoplasms, connective tissue diseases, infections, trauma, and panniculitis should also be included in the differential diagnosis.	2.1922857341742263
A 38-year-old Caucasian female patient with hereditary prolidase deficiency developed progressive and very painful leg ulcers.	2.182463314085274
The ulcers first appeared in childhood and did not respond to various treatments.	2.482224893799072
Additional features of prolidase deficiency included mental retardation, short stature, extensive dental caries, and multiple malar teleangiectases.	1.9255805414541098
Hereditary prolidase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disease.	2.498849402484225
It is caused by heterogeneous mutations of the prolidase gene and affects many aspects of protein metabolism.	2.0194407305123296
Ion exchange chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis of urine can prove the suspected diagnosis.	1.9877631926533483
So far, there is no efficient therapy for hereditary prolidase deficiency.	2.5232168711368166
All reported treatment attempts have ended in failure.	2.199765375029264
In this paper the basic features of acute, subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis, skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described.	1.9098567542684624
The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms, culture studies, laboratory studies and radiological signs.	2.096676121644312
The common conservative and surgical treatments are discussed.	2.306769516099257
In the treatment of post-traumatic/postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of multiresistant strains.	2.4622435783849945
Thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics, a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed.	2.3585333471590118
Despite this improved prognosis, an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon.	2.2631753683404665
Besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics, the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus.	2.1872492105233055
Thus, physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics.	2.247145275254122
Very early, i. e. in 1984, the German Medical Association developed professional laws for reproductive medicine.	2.201958695738976
In addition, the German government saw the need in 1990 for an "Embryo Protection Law" (Embryonenschutzgesetz).	1.9018133134666348
Today, in the light of European integration, the medical profession's and state's obligations are challenged in different ways.	2.14725811265658
Whereas the German Medical Association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics - currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the government must develop the sociolegal framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine, i. e. , in the areas of inheritance law, adoption law, family law, and law of succession, the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs. social paternity in heterologous insemination.	1.816862954090031
In Crohn's disease, some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following malabsorption of vitamin B12 or folic acid, opticus neuropathy, and polyneuropathy have been described.	1.891339639955497
We report on three such cases in three female patients (aged 26, 29, and 61 years).	1.9497744858178252
All patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis; one complained additionally of a speech disorder, headache, and intermittent loss of orientation.	1.8383055777597679
In CT and MRI scans, multiple lesions were detected; cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle- and large-sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis.	1.9896100501373892
Serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time.	2.175364019881098
Under anticoagulation (in two cases) and immunosuppressive therapy, neurologic symptoms disappeared.	2.3761182798235336
In the following 6 to 12 months, no new neurological symptoms appeared.	2.387400202305005
In two cases, Doppler sonographic controls showed stationary and, in one case, progressive intracranial stenoses.	2.30657346686567
The serin protease tryptase (ECNr.	2.3131982277433023
3.4.21.59), which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells, is released by mast cell degranulation in an enzymatically active form together with other mediators, e.g.	1.940491736439157
histamine, into the extracellular space and the circulation.	2.3678860864777156
Therefore, in the skin, a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions, but also in other inflammatory diseases, degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing, where an accumulation and/or activation of mast cells is found.	2.4135647958471336
Extracellular tryptase may be superior to histamine as a parameter for the onset and course of immediate type reactions and as an indicator for the activation of mast cells in other conditions.	2.195747148847405
In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues.	2.496897416110223
Background: Since the development of lacrimal endoscopes with which the mucosa and disorders of the lacrimal drainage system can be examined directly, the choice of surgical technique has changed decisively.	2.3766820173112317
Flexible miniendoscopes can be combined with a laser for the first time, allowing for exact localization of the stenosis and subsequent therapy.	2.4234861382485535
Surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-B3 and C1- C3) makes high demands on traumatological management.	1.8218586220721573
By using modern, minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta-articular fractures, it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result.	2.277285057763181
The aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures.	2.2231622325356946
Arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma, but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation, as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra-articular injuries, a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods.	2.403021434934191
From a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients at our clinic from September 1994 to January 1998.	2.331647205771604
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients revealed good recoveries when assayed by means of the Lysholm and Delamarter score.	2.51289991627882
We suggest that arthroscopically assisted, minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of AO classification 41 C1-C3 fractures.	2.3890669910806213
Dorsal tension band fixation is a wide-spread technique of finger arthrodesis.	2.331115940470683
When using a resorbable PDS-suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed.	1.967780081559302
Aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup-in-cone-procedure.	2.7508207294886833
Freeze-preserved fingers with thread tension band fixation using the PDS-material (series 1), the same fixating method on formaldehyde preserved fingers (series 3), freeze-preserved fingers with a standard tension band fixating (wire loop, series 2) are load in a four-point-bending in the direction of palmarflexion.	1.8954847958034053
From 6 degrees onwards the wire-tension-system requires a higher torque for bending, but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture.	2.046155694376525
The examination shows that the thread-tension-band method by PDS-loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces.	1.8240902089622757
Modern medicine has succeeded in achieving enormous technical developments.	2.1339832953552618
One recent highlight has been the introduction of postmortem organ transplantation.	2.493507621170444
At the same time, serious objections have been raised concerning the radical changes in the cultural conception of the inviolable body.	2.0220465597600454
One major objection arises from the conflict of considering a brain-dead person as dead.	2.028082519639083
The presence of brain death is a prerequisite for post-mortem organ donation, because only during this phase of dying does the individual quality as dead while the organs, other than the brain, remain viable.	1.9577087522831005
The objection implies scepticism as to the physician's ability to distinguish a dead from a living person.	2.0487553219931023
On the other hand, even the critics must rely on the physician's ability to discriminate, e.g., when to discontinue resuscitation.	1.988242456170577
The medical community has not found reasons to restrict the definition of irreversible coma 25 years after its first formulation.	2.010485096135064
It must be clearly recognised that reasons other than medical ones can be decisive for refusing organ donation.	1.8299488993082675
One ethical problem is the therapeutic benefit of organ transplantation.	2.417303214112762
The beneficiary of the treatment is not the donor, but another person, the recipient.	2.5268490931256946
The concept of human dignity does not allow the use of a person fur purposes other than the ones he/she consents to, as Immanuel Kant stated.	2.0422217039272246
Although the human corpse is not a person in the full sense, even if it is protected by the thought of respect for the former person, the life-interest of the organ recipient had to be considered legitimate.	2.2516545384087228
The resulting conflict between the respect for the donor and the life-interest of the recipient should be balanced by seeking the donor's consent as far as possible.	1.8696487739567278
The proposed information model seems adequate at the moment.	2.314239747006642
A common report of both churches in Germany in 1990 supported postmortem organ transplantation.	2.080973123656627
The report dealt with the medical problems and harmonized them with the Christian value of solidarity.	2.0912963987618176
The ethical alternatives to organ transplantation, however, are not mentioned.	2.597889666006501
Within this limitation, the report seems to adequately express the aim to strengthen individual competence and plead for fair perception of the neighbour's life-interest.	1.8313814189405409
Starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly, as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport.	2.3079145066372435
Elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour.	1.858272638088836
Driver assistance systems, just available or soon on the market, are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers.	2.1279308872593656
An expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are: emergency systems, enhanced vision systems and parking aids.	2.1533153712685262
Emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver's request, and direct them to the emergency location.	2.033130363510099
Self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve lightning and automatic dipping.	2.0749348900217086
Parking aids, using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with movability problems.	1.9497906931243179
The group of helpful, but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car, comprising autonomous cruise control, antilock systems and electronic stability programmes.	1.8882017831079307
The value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory.	2.3145520797374877
Reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems, helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without orientational problems.	1.7095345276048235
The article demonstrates the particular importance of specific layouts of the man-machine-interface for elderly, to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic.	1.8145985687945334
Causal treatment regimens of proven effectiveness in controlled studies are only available for cases of male infertility resulting from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.	2.007621118429046
Drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized studies.	2.129557293223472
The results of immunosuppressive therapy in cases of immunological male infertility are still controversial .	2.3271775821899436
In addition, antiphlogistic and antibiotic treatment of chronic male genital tract infections has not been shown to improve male fertility.	2.377885370881714
Inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy - e.g., with kallikein, tamoxifen, clomiphene, pentoxifylline, mast cell blockers, testolacton, vitamin E, captopril, alpha receptor blockers, glutathione, indometacin, interferon alpha, growth hormone, zinc salts, ketoprofen, mesterone or testosterone undecanoate - or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement.	1.721403538806675
Recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure FSH, while GnrH and FSH have no influence on spermatogenesis in normogonadotropic men.	1.8237627248840782
In 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in 5 patients with non-AD dementia and in 36 cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).	2.1539012487848592
Of the AD patients, 19 were very mildly demented (MMSE score from 25 to 28).	1.9717251546291297
Even in these patients, CSF tau was significantly more elevated than in controls.	2.3826997213358987
In the non-AD patients protein tau was less increased.	2.4811161511035347
Among the AD patients there was no association between CSF tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow, determined by SPECT.	2.1691100098565945
Our findings suggest that CSF tau may be elevated even at the predementia stage of AD and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease.	2.0831522341169313
The aim of our review is to summarize relevant data on the perioperative use of anti-ischaemic drugs in patients at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	2.094661331044154
The accessible medical literature according to current electronic information sources was explored.	2.0614550744621387
One in every eight general anaesthetics is administered to a patient at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	2.011191707566236
Of these patients, it is estimated that 20% - 40% have perioperative myocardial ischaemia (PMI), the majority being nonsymptomatic.	2.591464663508078
This figure correlates with the occurrence of postoperative cardiac complications and myocardial infarction.	2.447297293117507
The anaesthetist therefore has an important role to play in reducing the rate of perioperative cardiac sequelae.	2.569105079232737
This can be achieved with good control of haemodynamic stability and the timely and appropriate use of antiischaemic drugs.	2.0360336768300495
Acting as coronary and systemic vasodilators, they effect an immediate reduction in preload and have been shown to be the drugs of first choice for intraoperative myocardial ischaemia.	2.2475025278553704
Beta-blockers reduce the rate of PMI to a greater extent than nitrates.	2.298308450118989
They are also effective in myocardial ischaemia not accompanied by an increased heart rate.	2.3559726020522307
Single pre-operative administration of beta-blockers has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing theincidence of perioperative tachycardia, hypertension, and PMI.	2.256758760824551
Consequently, such one-time medication can be considered for previously untreated high-risk patients presenting for surgery.	2.3936554586094907
The continuation of oral calcium channel blockers to the morning of surgery also reduces the rate of PMI and myocardial infarction in coronary-bypass patients, and combination with beta-blockers enhances this effect.	2.14623829164148
Intra-operative diltiazem infusions are similarly advantageous in this patient group.	2.185656193683789
In addition to nitrates, calcium antagonists are the drug of choice for coronary vasospasm.	2.206012497730674
Drugs inhibiting platelet aggregation have a particular role in patients with coronary heart disease, however, they also cause increased perioperative bleeding.	2.727625833548725
Consequently, it is recommended that these medications be discontinued 5 - 10 days prior to major surgery, with the exception of high-risk patients.	2.513423161469464
Pilot studies using alpha2-agonists have shown reduced anaesthetic requirements and a reduction in PMI.	2.162539600102373
The perioperative relevance of these drugs is currently being investigated.	2.51619507072903
Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and possibly alpha2-agonists lead to reduced rates of PMI and other cardiac complications in risk patients.	1.980718936900623
Current anti-anginal medications, with the exception of anti-platelet agents, should be maintained to the day of surgery and continued as soon as possible thereafter.	2.3235901718685166
All of these drugs except anti-platelet agents may also be used intra-operatively, however, possible interactions with anaesthetic agents should be carefully considered.	2.430724878356261
Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) were thought to be psychosomatic disorders.	2.1421234071025026
However, this argument has recently been questioned by many researchers.	2.180391050692462
At the same time, biomedical factors have been described that were claimed to play a role in the aetiology and modulation of the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).	2.398282430837312
In the present paper, the state of research regarding both biomedical and psychosomatic factors of the aetiology and course of IBD is reviewed and critically evaluated from a methodological perspective.	2.014242724658164
Results covering the following topics are presented: epidemiology; sociodemographic variables; genetic factors; dietary factors and cigarette smoking; drugs; permeability of bowel epithelia; immunological factors; microbiological factors; psychiatric disorders, affective symptoms, personality factors; life events and psychosocial stress; quality of life; and coping with the illness.	1.9015112216518222
Among biomedical factors, a genetically based pathological immune reaction is highly probable.	2.155159034579301
However, the findings of immunological disturbances are of a more descriptive nature and seem to explain not the aetiological process of the development of the disease, but rather a kind of disposition.	2.468237285539528
The question of which agents trigger the pathological immune cascade is still under investigation.	2.104505546146589
Interesting findings can possibly be expected of the psycho-neuro-immunological research in this area.	2.0391571301352336
Results of research on psychological pathology (psychiatric disorders, personality factors) are inconclusive.	2.139185406205118
Part of the high rate of psychiatric morbidity might be due to effects of selective sampling of more disturbed subjects.	2.5076419240048744
Research pertaining to the influence of distressing life events has also yielded inconsistent results.	2.3309013309773117
Prospective studies about the association of psychosocial stress and somatic symptomatology mostly demonstrated cross-sectional correlations which did not allow for causal interpretations.	2.0300146958296876
However, coping research has shown interesting results that point to the mediating influence of coping strategies on the course of the disease.	1.9599939497002905
Finally, perspectives for future research are suggested.	2.3559325933131126
Genital infection, particularly bacterial vaginosis (BV), increases the relative risk of prematurity.	2.0703458916749335
Detection of disturbances of vaginal milieu at an early stage and the use of suitable countermeasures such as intervention with antimicrobial substances can reduce the preterm birth rate.	2.149720763552005
Most cases are consistent with a twin pregnancy, with distinct borders between placenta and mole on sonography.	1.9404272480836122
The pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the 34th week of gestation with marked hypotrophy.	2.162294281539332
The non-molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of villous maturity resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus.	2.0173905808730286
No malignancy occured post partum.	2.474072446202222
The clinical and pathogenetic aspects of this rare entity are discussed.	2.4820244271455874
So far, necrosis of the lunate bone has been interpreted in the literature as a phenomenon with a traumatic, primarily vascular-arterial or mechanical causation.	2.1195182461266673
These models seem problematic, since neither the patients' histories nor the macroscopic-radiographical or histological appearances can be reconciled with them.	1.945701650063889
In contrast, the model of a primarily venous aetiopathogenesis accepted for idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head is now examined.	2.042981636179888
Evaluation of 125 cases of lunate bone necrosis treated in the Department of Orthopaedics at the University Hospital in Heidelberg between 1958 and 1993 made it possible to reconstruct the spontaneous course of the condition.	2.331515977940852
X-Ray material, core spin tomographic images and material from a prospective study carried out in 49 patients with unexplained painful conditions of the wrist were available.	2.2836325528401096
A stage-by-stage progression emerged, which initially caused alterations only in the MR image, while the X-ray picture remained unremarkable.	2.2889758290520175
It was recognized from the spontaneous course that subsequent changes in the shape of the diseased lunate bones were always the result of the necrotic transformation process and never the cause of it.	2.2966389738128865
This meant that fractures were excluded as a possible cause of necrosis of the lunate bone.	2.3960890539140047
The spontaneous course was used as the basis of a stage-related classification for lunate bone necrosis.	2.417911960707076
In a pressure measurement test, the behaviour of the intraosseous pressure in 16 necrotic lunate bones, 16 healthy lunate bones and 16 healthy capitate bones was tested under various functional conditions.	1.8968397340132401
The pressure fluctuations in the capitate bones were very slight, while in the healthy lunate bones pressure increased significantly during extension of the wrist.	2.0556397130774977
The pressure increases in necrotic lunate bones were significantly in excess of those in healthy ones; in some cases they were far in excess of the systolic blood pressure.	2.0991680708965323
It was also concluded that necrotic lunate bones were mechanically deformed on movement.	1.9875522503897656
The anatomical causes of the pronounced pressure increases were examined experimentally.	2.237856962716113
After staining of both the arteries and the veins, epoxy sheet plastination was used to fix six fresh cadaver arms in the neutral position and six in extension.	1.9389520724837654
Visualization of the vessels showed that capsular-ligamentous structures that were stretched on the palmar side and slackly turned back on themselves on the dorsal side still allowed the blood supply from the arteries, but substantially hindered venous drainage.	1.7867302389810156
The anatomical preparations made it possible to see that venous drainage from the lunate bone was being prevented; this explained the pronounced pressure increases.	1.9646285375684147
The unphysiological position of the base of the radius inclined in the palmar direction relative to the hand axis when it was extended dorsally was the crucial factor in the development of necrosis.	2.2489507511860243
Evaluation of the histories of the patients with necrosis of the lunate bone made it clear that trauma was not significantly involved in the causation, while manual work had an important role.	2.3926505302672423
Most manual activites are performed with the wrist in extension.	2.3870052631977865
Any extension favours triggering of bone necrosis through congestion in the venous trunk.	2.0938872812019707
Thus, our investigations have shown that the beginning of this illness starts with congestion such as occurs with every extension of the wrist, which is initially physiological, before further factors favouring the process cause it to take a pathologic course.	2.1330876440243824
The results of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 confirm allergies as widespread diseases in Germany.	2.048736559904155
In total 40 to 43 % of the adult population have or have had an allergic disease.	2.10771601800306
The morbidity was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire and a personal interview performed by a physician.	2.300691852013633
The agreement between questionnaire and interview data is greater than 90 % for allergic rhinitis, food allergy and urticaria and about 80 % for contact dermatitis and asthma.	1.900209048690915
The results of both assessment methods showed remarkable differences between East and West Germany.	1.9705360925796118
Using the interview data 17 % of the West but only 11 % of the East German adults have/had e.g.	1.892893817974655

For the emergency treatment of sustained, hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia, antiarrhythmic drugs are the therapy of choice.	2.233027182429957
Mostly class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine or ajmaline, are preferred.	2.384535656035294
In hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia, electrical cardioversion should be applied, in case of recurrences, followed by pharmaclogical treatment with class I antiarrhythmic drugs or amiodarone.	2.2862119439835253

The result of an investigation of 128 from 283 (45,2%) medical and psychological psychotherapists established in the city of Hannover is presented.	2.1940277698365493
The aim of the study is to characterize the situation of psychotherapeutical care not only by the number of psychotherapists in relation to inhabitants but also by the working time spent for psychotherapy.	2.160916621612116
Besides we found gender, school of psychotherapy and professional experience as factor influencing the patients waiting time for beginning a psychotherapy.	1.9175527063554452
In contrast to other studies, the number of medical and psychological psychotherapists is not different, nevertheless the psychotherapeutical care in Hannover is not ensured.	2.2847033014752203

The anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies which often remains asymptomatic until the patients achieve advanced age but may also be clinically manifest already in infants and lead to sudden death.	2.2427136953306444
We report the diagnostics and surgical treatment in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child and the necessity of surgical repair.	2.3556953100937483
The diagnosis was incidentally made during an echocardiographic procedure and confirmed by coronary angiography.	2.05150626051771
A reimplantation of the ano origin of the coronary artery was carried out wihtout using extra-corporal circulation.	2.360161848050446
There were no postoperative complications.	2.35355594026068
Due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the related coronary risk, surgical repair is recommended also for asymptomatic cases.	2.034397543345091
The surgical management of vesicovaginal fistulae (VVF) is a matter of controversy.	2.2653283098503834
This study deals with our experience with transvaginally treated patients suffering from VVF.	2.5321363824608456
Between 1966 and 1996, 64 patients with VVF were treated surgically.	2.4432502203010937
The VVF occurred in the course of hysterectomy in 54 patients, was due to radiotherapy in 7, was a result of obstetric complications in 2 patients, and occurred after colporrhaphy in 1 patient.	2.5064187068111403
In 60 of these 64 patients closure of the fistula was carried out transvaginally.	2.5998547954591738
Fourteen of these 60 patients (23 %) had undergone prior surgical attempts to close the VVF (1 to 3 procedures).	2.0867131596971915
Transvaginal surgery was successful at first attempt in 55 of these 60 patients (92 %).	2.105940497719891
The other 5 patients were successfully treated by a second procedure (again transvaginal: n = 3; transabdominal: n = 2).	2.183438653369402
In conclusion, the transvaginal approach to close VVF is of advantage, avoiding an abdominal incision and reducing postoperative morbidity.	1.8404758049872108
In the vast majority of the cases isolated VVF can be treated successfully by transvaginal repair.	2.705363256682144
Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder involving muscle, brain, heart, eyes, and endocrine organs.	2.0391947806846553
The underlying mutation is an expanding trinucleotide CTG repeat in the 3'prime untranslated region of a serine-threonine kinase gene on chromosome 19q.	1.754909212386704
A statistical correlation exists between the CTG copy number and the severity of the disease.	2.252643770629369
Infants with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy have been shown to have on average a greater amplification of the CTG repeat than is seen in the non-congenital myotonic dystrophy population.	2.248291413515409
However, not all patients with many CTG copies develop congenital myotonic dystrophy.	2.2922166899014687
We present 13 patients with more than 1500 CTG trinucleotide repeats and show their variable clinical course.	2.0438545504099475
Whilst the incidence of psychiatric disorders decreases during pregnancy, the risk during the postpartum period increases significantly, often leading to the necessity of psychopharmacological intervention during the puerperium, and subsequently during lactation and breast-feeding.	2.153118692694862
The necessity for lithium prophylaxis in manic-depressive women after childbirth has been identified, and it is recommended that weaning rather than omission of psychopharmacological treatment is preferable during the puerperium.	1.9133524011025955

In 300 patients with 339 coronary lesions the percent diameter stenosis (%-DS) was assessed both by visual estimation and by digital quantitative coronary angiography (DQCA) by use of an on-line computer workstation.	1.8581584792839472
The decision for coronary angioplasty in the same setting ("prima vista"-PTCA) was based on history, evidence of ischemia and visual estimation of %-DS.	2.155626063847084
DQCA measurements of the 339 stenoses revealed a normal distribution of lesion severity with a mean of 58.4  +/-  11.3%.	2.28711851772574
In contrast to DQCA visual estimation led to a bimodal distribution with a nadir at ~55% between two peaks at ~45% and ~75% and a mean of 70.5  +/-  19.6%.	1.9573176397542476
Visual estimation underestimated lesions in the range of 30-55% and overestimated the %-DS between 55-99%.	2.2057881252850216
Visual estimation revealed a %-DS >= 60% in 251 stenoses (74.0%) of the 339 lesions, an estimate that led to subsequent "prima vista"-PTCA.	1.9861638864681441
Conversely, DQCA revealed only 184 stenoses (54.3%) with a %-DS >= 60%; thus, 86 stenoses (25.3%) did not meet the morphologic indication criteria for PTCA.	1.9299290223970826
The bimodal distribution of stenosis severity according to visual analysis with an overestimation of borderline stenosis severity reflects a tendency for "self-referral" of patients for PTCA.	1.9339393971312249
DQCA serves as an objective tool in the decision-making process for PTCA and may reduce "cosmetic" interventions or justify to defer PTCA.	2.125288736239433
Especially in the selection process for "prima vista"-PTCA DQCA-quantification of stenosis severity is recommended.	1.9776282188961019
S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum concentrations serve as markers of cerebral damage in cardiac surgery, neurology, or after head injury.	1.9859150369083363

The present study investigated the diagnostic value in orthopaedic patients after joint replacement.	2.147049121177382
Since its introduction in clinical use more than ten years ago, propofol is well appreciated for sedation and supplemental hypnosis in anaesthesia.	2.017884241050629
However the substance is approved only for anaesthesia in children elder than three years.	2.0630664832580567
As can be substantiated by many data reported in literature, there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons whatsoever to withhold propofol from the younger children; this applies both to the use as a narcotic supplement and as a short term hypnotic for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.	2.0079320282396833
Orthostatic circulatory disorders are frequently the cause of orthostatic intolerance, syncope or dangerous falls.	2.198215327650813
A sufficient therapy should be based on a differential diagnosis by means of an active standing test or a tilt-table test.	2.536489484587749
Three typical pathological reactions of blood pressure and heart rate can be differentiated.	2.4404810200285296
The hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is characterised by an immediate drop in blood pressure (systolic drop >20 mmHg below base line within 3 min) with or without compensatory tachycardia.	2.1145285382689667
It is caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction.	2.2988275785189463
Tachycardia (>30 beats per minute above base line within 10 min) without significant blood pressure drop but with a fall of cerebral blood flow indicates a postural tachycardia syndrome.	1.957583338856794
In general, there is no further somatic dysfunction.	2.78248300611278
Increased venous pooling is thought to be the assumed pathomechanism.	2.768961976122132
A reflex mechanism evokes the neurocardiogenic syncope after a certain time of standing: sympathetic inhibition yields a strong blood pressure drop and vagal activation bradycardia.	1.7772891665560333
Proved therapies include use of the mineralocorticoide fludrocortison (hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension), of the a-agonist midodrin (postural tachycardia syndrome) and of b-blockers (neurocardiogenic syncope).	1.9688929318967883
There are numerous diseases which can irreversibly stiffen the whole spine or parts of the axial skeleton.	2.044361649319827
Due to didactic reasons one can distinguish 3 gropus of such disorders: -  Paradigmatic diseases of the spine with an inherent proneness to stiffness.	1.9938610067043816
-  Rare diseases which involve a certain danger of stiffening the spine.	2.070425468012367
-  Rigidity of the spine due to scientifically unrecognised morphologic phenomena.	2.3591880995858174
Modern approaches in knee endoprosthetics using computer-assisted navigation systems are based on matching procedures which refer to osseous anatomical landmarks.	2.0840007102758533
However, surface replacement techniques require a correct position of the implants in relation to the bone, as well as an optimal postoperative interaction of the ligaments and the surface design of the endoprosthesis.	2.3818843805961216
Functional aspects are of elementary importance.	2.4525836853461067
A 79-year-old man died of fatal haemorrhage into the soft tissue of the true pelvis 2 days after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy.	2.1721059133363214
Autopsy revealed a perforation of the left prostatic lobe with ruptures of the periprostatic vessels.	2.3891256371346006
A similar case of transrectal prostatic biopsy-associated complication has not been described previously.	2.2207026722070817
The judicial enquiries were discontinued.	2.422482148159313
Several different theories exist about the orign of kinetosis and the space adaption syndrome, with individual sensitivities differing significantly.	1.8654061685343657
One explanation involves the hypothesis of a different otolith mass between the right and left statolith organ and especially a difference in the utricles.	2.068245037303459
A difference in mass results in a different sensitivity to acceleration.	2.496472791904793
For this reason we measured interindividual variances in saccular and utricular otolith mass.	1.8349291183802414
Since the anatomy of the vestibular organ in vertebrates is based as similar principles, we selected fish (salmon and trout) as our study model to facilitation preparations.	1.7841854438950495
The maximum difference in mass in the saccule was 17% and was generally smaller in the utricle, although in individual cases was much higher.	1.9886119270210412
We assume that a misbalanced sensitivity of the statolith organs occurs but is totally compensated for by the vestibular system as long as physiological motion patterns take place.	1.9615688459130516
Decompensation leads to kinetosis under non-physiological motion patterns.	2.1661248463298124
When the vestibular system is better balanced and has an equally distributed otolith mass to both sides, the possibility for developing kinetosis or space adaption syndrome is much less likely.	1.8892049741659416
The clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of haematogenous multifocal osteomyelitis, a rare illness, are described.	2.3033096687839882
Staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in both of the cases we described.	2.636162780622013
Sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for the localization of subperiosteal abscesses; scintigraphy is a supplementary examination for cases where it is difficult to establish a diagnosis.	2.3109362516535974
MR-tomography is the most reliable method for examination of proximal infected foci (spondylitis, pelvis osteomyelitis).	2.3077492047909796
Interactions between the endocrine and immune systems are well known with special regard to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	2.1731927620722975
Little of the literature focuses on the complex effects of cytokines on tissue responsiveness to glucocorticoids (GC).	2.216913380486032
In bone tissue, osteoblasts represent a valuable model for studying GC-cytokine interactions.	2.040808484740848
Hence, we have studied two human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2 and MG-63) with different degrees of differentiation and different constitutive IL-6 production (3.4 +/- 0.3 (mean  +/- SE) and 3309 +/- 578 pg/106 cells).	1.8591173709653337
We measured glucocorticoid receptor (GR) number and affinity as a function of the exposure of cells to different amounts of IL-6.	2.1681286678119247
Incubation for 20 h with IL-6 at increasing concentrations up to 2000 pg/ml yielded a significant increase of GR binding sites in both cell lines.	2.1605652668769464
IL-6 was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone (1 µmol/l) on GR in both cell lines.	2.156281101220634
In MG-63 cells, expressing higher concentrations of GR, IL-6 deprivation via a specific anti-IL-6 antibody (100 ng/ml) significantly decreased GR.	2.1168729695261757
In Saos-2 cells, expressing lower concentrations of GR, a 40 h treatment with human IL-1 (10 ng/ml) significantly increased both IL-6 production and GR.	2.1869775891953993
This latter effect was completely abolished by co-treating the cells with the anti-IL-6 antibody.	2.097618649496921
Our results provide evidence that IL-6 is an autocrine positive modulator of GR number in human osteoblasts.	2.052317423656982
Tumor debulking of gastrointestinal tumors for the reduction of tumor mass is intended to improve subsequent treatment efficacy.	2.159689122250142
However, in advanced malignant disease, this therapy is often associated with increased morbidity and lethality.	2.207295123465618
Adjuvant therapies cannot be initiated when needed.	2.344460741713258
Therefore, long-term survival remains unaffected.	2.8842568742925634
Advances in biomedical science provide preliminary explanations for these therapeutic problems.	2.072325937539006
Modern therapeutic concepts like neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors are based on these findings.	2.4102075332288195
The probability of complete R0 resections, necessary to improve long-term survival, can be enhanced by these therapies.	2.369520424707586
The ongoing prospective neoadjuvant studies for gastrointestinal tumors are already very encouraging.	2.050189948330865
The simulation of unilateral deafness is very rare.	2.5187715263667143
Objective findings are of special interest if it happens.	2.521745745913421
A patient with alleged deafness on the left-hand side due to commotio cerebri was treated in our hospital.	2.1109458820461624
Pure tone audiometry showed deafness on the left-hand side and normal hearing on the right-hand side.	2.224536990830627
Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were measured.	2.0024704878654593
The TEOAE had the same reproducibility but a very low response on both sides, such that inner ear function could not be evaluated.	2.239338107987397
In comparison, the DP gram showed clear DP amplitudes over the whole frequency range on both sides.	2.0066227059765382
Nonphysiological DPs could be excluded by assessing the DP growth rate at three different frequencies.	2.258449958549687
By means of brainstem electric response audiometry (BERA), with which the IV/V complex was detectable up to stimulation with 20 dB SPL clicks, and the Stenger test, a neural or central hearing loss could be excluded.	1.9107003053039766
Normal hearing on the left-hand side was thus confirmed.	2.3748048474912644
In cases of simulated deafness it is possible to prove a normal inner ear function by DPOAE.	2.1599854195287023
DPOAE therefore complements the list of potential audiological simulation tests.	2.182354496064429
Controlled studies of adrenal steroids in premenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have revealed subtle and inconsistent decreases in glucocorticosteroid (GCS) function, but prominent deficiencies of adrenal androgens (AA).	1.7746718798660361
However, recent prospective studies of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels before (x = 12 yrs) the onset of the disease (pre-RA) offer an alternative perspective.	2.007607481592926
Significant dissociation of serum cortisol and DHEAS levels was found only in the subgroup of premenopausal women who developed RA before age 50.	1.9874292438217112
This subgroup alone had significant deficiency in serum DHEAS levels.	2.108268852258878
A growing number of casualties and the increasing restrictions of funding will lead as a consequence to changes within the field of trauma surgery.	2.300859404389849
Despite these developments trauma surgery must maintain its major responsibility towards the victims of accidents.	1.9535710975687477
Therefore the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) has to face the future economic and social challenges to influence the coming changes.	2.0051297292507595
This role compromises the engagement in a continuous struggle for the high and global standard of injury care in Germany, for quality assessment, education and training, research and adequate public relations.	2.0762885635525996
This paper outlines the aspects and visions of future trauma surgery and the means which may continue to guaranty international acknowledged standard of trauma care in Germany.	1.8869281895879715
Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.	2.7694621134735664
Electrophysiologic investigations in 623 patients revealed eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation: Ablation of fast (I) or slow(II), modification of fast (III) or slow AV nodal pathways (IV), modification of both pathways (V), ablation of fast and modification of slow (VI), ablation of slow and modification of fast pathways (VII) and ablation of both pathways (VIII).	1.907643362346329
The criteria of diagnosis of these eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation are described.	2.1857431422945504
Follow-up showed fewer relapses in patients with ablation (0-2%) in comparison to patients with modification of a single AV nodal pathway (8-12%).	2.5475214439882943
Alteration of both pathways includes an increasing risk of total AV nodal block, which occured in 7 patients (1.1%).	2.1138377254855114
Detailed analysis of the mechanism of catheter ablation is recommended in all patients after radiofrequency current delivery for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia to estimate the risk of relapsing during follow-up or development of total AV block in the particular patient in case of a further ablation procedure.	2.6860889864442523
An increasing life expectancy leads to a higher number of persons aged 70-84 years and persons aged 85 years and older.	2.202442709219485
Information concerning changes in the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity is rare.	2.980521321014625
The Berlin Aging Study was based on a representative age- and gender-stratified sample (n = 516) of Berlin citizens aged 70-100 years and older.	2.0576633858483464
In this interdisciplinary study, an intensive investigation was carried out by psychologists, sociologists, internists and psychiatrists.	2.1006211633255742
This report focuses on subjectively reported complaints (Beschwerdeliste, BL), observed psychopathological symptomatology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS) and psychiatric diagnoses following the criteria of DSM-III-R (based on the Geriatric Mental State Examination, GMS-A).	1.7168599125537343
On the self-rating scale (BL) 10 % of all persons reported severe subjective complaints, 32 % moderate complaints.	2.022754610850785
On the BPRS, 17 % showed severe psychopathological symptomatology, 75 % at least mild symptoms.	1.9514869784699687
Following the criteria of DSM-III-R, 23.5 % of all persons had a psychiatric disease, 4.2 % a disease of severe intensity.	2.011185189466096
The most frequent psychiatric diseases were insomnia (18.8 %), depression NOS (17.8 %) and dementia (13.8 %).	1.8122805721541178
Dementia showed the well-known age-related increase, whereas no other incidences of psychiatric morbidity were age-related.	2.3990383032532514
Persons aged 70-84 years did not differ in the investigated psychiatric variables from persons aged 85 years and older, the only exception being the prevalence of dementia.	2.079938588075582

Semi-structured interviews of 400 patients were reanalyzed to identify homogeneous groups concerning initial reactions at first manifestations of the disease.	1.9106521636239102
We were able to describe typical courses of illness behaviour depending on the initial reaction.	2.339308318089318
The results are discussed with regard to the desirable identification of problematic patients within professional care units.	2.164445945196157
The sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.	2.570526948755734
Malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform: initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly hypoechoic lesions can be found.	2.0512305032149207
Generally, four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described: diffuse, small nodular, large nodular and bulky type.	1.8767968679194216
Secondary, tumor-related or inflammatory complications (e. g. dislocation or compression of vessels, thoracic inlet syndrome, venous thrombosis, ileus, urinary retention, abscess and effusion) can be sonographically evaluated.	2.108868793010379
Response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor-related complications.	2.1359394328439714
Differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and, with certain restrictions, on the echogenicity of lesions and perfusion feasible with Doppler sonography.	2.122299655233994
The primary diagnosis has to be established histologically.	2.873458480507834
The treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an antidislocation augmentation.	2.346700995707016
Tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed.	2.357722294191645
For the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft, which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach.	2.5537184449743653
Ultrasound of the Achilles tendon is a suitable means of differentiating various diseases of the tendon and the surrounding tissue.	2.3455966617738677
Different forms of degenerative disease (tendinitis, peritendinitis or bursitis, fibroosteitis, and Haglund's disease) can be discriminated from rheumatic and metabolic diseases.	1.8772610662266305
Congenital and developmental abnormalities can also be detected.	2.6599139682991484
Tendon degeneration mainly occurs in the ventral part of the medial third of the tendon ("critical zone").	2.816147415405778
Immature tissue in this area leads to temorary instability of the tendon with a high risk of rupture ("vulnerable phase").	2.5830684917549833
With sonography, lesions of the Achilles tendon are visible early in the course of the disease.	2.456705320455136
The German social security legislation has recognized only recently the concern of quality assessment in the field of social and medical services.	2.0947941277829356
The legal frame for quality assessment in the field of medical treatment was enacted in the sickness insurance provision (Social Code - Book V) only in 1989.	1.958779585506684
Quality assessment is considered to be a part of the production of medical services and, therefore, is regulated in the context of providing medical services.	2.665938857577138
The legal provisions do not establish standards for quality and quality assessment.	2.190640661169697
Due to the variety of medical services, quality assessment is not regulated in an exhaustive or systematic manner.	2.1766329886697067
According to the law, providers of medical services (doctors, hospitals) are bound to participate in quality assessment.	2.0576558591285927
As internal quality assessment prevails in the definition of the various measures of quality assessment and the control of quality in all fields of medical treatment, external quality assessment is also prescribed for hospitals.	2.4405752634926694
Because the establishment of quality assessment is considered to be a part of the service production organization, consumers (patients) or their representatives are not involved in the definition, establishment, and control of quality assessment.	2.403931665363208
The participation of patients should be provided by law.	2.6601827618546667
Introduction: Because of an increasing number of endoscopic hernia procedures, it is important to look into the possibility of standardizing these techniques helping surgeons to acquire the operative skills necessary.	2.2931042080162287
Material and Methods: To discuss these aspects, the documented data on TAPP operations that have been carried out in this department since 1993 were analyzed.	2.0847676096479533
The results of teaching procedures were compared with those of experts after they had gotten past the learning and development curve.	2.1211614463186037
Results: A total of 778 teaching procedures were performed by 10 surgeons with an individual experience of 30.5 operations (median).	2.0660284090245535
Before starting the first procedure, 89 were done by assistants operating the camera.	2.0857560680794593
The morbidity of teaching operations was 1.9 % compared to 1.4 % for those performed by experts.	1.987012082077513
After a median follow-up of 23 months there were two recurrences (0.23 %) in the expert group and none in the teaching group (follow-up 16 months).	2.3247146755803763
Conclusion: Because of the potentials of standardization of the TAPP technique, the results of teaching were equal to expert operations.	2.66153410092107
Therefore, TAPP is suitable for application in a routine setting.	2.4497180761631596
In spite of the high and lasting efficiency of transurethral prostatectomy, intraoperative blood loss results in increased morbidity in this procedure.	2.1534549264895393
To minimize the risk of bleeding, we improved the high-frequency technology in several steps.	2.608501517164288
To achieve this, the output signals of commercially available high-frequency generators were modulated to the effect that each cut results in an efficient coagulation zone in the tissue at excellent cutting quality.	1.972104631609494
As a result, blood transfusions were less necessary, the transurethral catheter could be removed earlier in the postoperative period, and hospitalization time was significantly reduced.	2.0610454383644727
In conclusion, the improved high-frequency technology in form of the "coagulating intermittent cutting" results in a blood-sparing tissue resection with a consecutive reduction of morbidity.	2.050302109366215
An accurate assessment of the duration of the ability to act following fatal poisoning can be of major importance in reconstructing circumstances leading to death, especially in determining whether the poisoning was accidental, self-inflicted, or the result of a criminal act.	2.3548396781680303
Clinical publications have scarcely dealt with this problem.	2.2599694914511668
We therefore examined 20 legal autopsies performed at the Institutes of Forensic Medicine of the Universities of Würzburg and Leipzig as well as the respective records of the police and prosecuting attorney's offices in an effort to clarify this question.	1.8771060945249973
As a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10-15 min.	2.1938055266509755
However, the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer.	2.2923942592719113
The present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication.	2.0866725091763665
However, in more than half of the patients the disease will ultimately progress within 2 years.	2.5194361232739295
Intermittent androgenablation through medical castration maintains the apoptotic potential.	2.1042892144232153
By periodically changing phases on and off treatment the quality of life of the patients is improved.	2.9044495514905933
Apart from reduced toxicity treatment costs are lowered and tumor progression is possibly delayed.	2.028137845946747
In how far survival is influenced is presently not clear and remains to be evaluated in further clinical trials.	2.183890827881382
During pressure support ventilation (PSV), the timing of the breathing cycle is mainly controlled by the patient.	2.3990991511891813
Therefore, the delivered flow pattern during PSV might be better synchronised with the patient's demands than during volume-assisted ventilation.	1.8099835431483355
In several modern ventilators, inspiration is terminated when the inspiratory flow decreases to 25% of the initial peak value.	2.0240210792258027
However, this timing algorithm might cause premature inspiration termination if the initial peak flow is high.	1.9555621550453846
This could result not only in an increased risk of dyssynchronization between the patient and the ventilator, but also in reduced ventilatory support.	2.5626799993692604
On the other hand, a decreased peak flow might inappropriately increase the patient's inspiratory effort.	1.9449802265221763
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the variation of the initial peak-flow rate during PSV on respiratory pattern and mechanical work of breathing.	2.1596076354323794
To date, positron emission tomography (PET) is the most powerful tool for the non-invasive study of biochemical processes.	2.494804874053306
Besides its usefulness for basic research PET has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications.	2.262052886720348
However, the introduction of PET into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs.	2.1737093587526846
Several American studies lend support to the hypothesis that PET may be more cost-effective than the conventional diagnostic work-up - at least for some of its clinical indications.	2.1442271613186845
In Germany, however, this hypothesis has still not been verified.	2.6498904086408426
The rapid growth, development and organ differentiation during early human development depend on an adequate and balanced substrate availability.	1.9620267339774726
It is well known that early nutrition has short term effects (e.g.	1.9774071192536067
on growth), and that marked metabolic imbalances in infancy (e.g.	2.493469943246668
hypoglycaemia, phenylketonuria) have long term effects on child development.	2.2382216422281114
More recent studies indicate that also variations of metabolic conditions within the normal range, which occur during sensitive periods of early human development, may have marked long term effects on later prognosis and disease risks in adulthood.	1.8863505736657493
This metabolic programming was demonstrated in epidemiologic studies indicating close relationships between indicators of early growth and the disease incidence and the mortality of coronary heart disease in late adulthood.	2.0845325691732355
Long term effects of infant feeding on immunological functions are indicated by the effects of infant feeds on later prevalence of allergic disease and by the difference in morbidity for diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease and malignant lymphoma between previously breast fed and formula fed infants.	1.972912594834354
An improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate these observed long term effects is required to enable effective preventive interventions.	2.219176703490244
Already the available information indicates a great potential for actively improving long term child health and development by an improved substrate supply during pregnancy and infancy.	1.9046691300382992
Persons who cross international boundaries are at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases.	2.3272642648382895
An analysis of the reported communicable diseases in Germany shows: A large number of cases of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, shigella infections, trichinellosis and brucellosis notified during the last years in Germany originated from foreign countries.	2.1075890407444255
Intervention measures are necessary, above all, with regard to gastrointestinal infections and vaccine-preventable diseases.	2.2702591358769544
Bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3,5 % of all testicular malignancies and to our knowlegde about 800 cases are reported in the literature.	2.0064789437165795
An even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non-germ cell tumor.	2.039811255283575
We report the 6th case of such a coincidence.	2.4601024847693047
Even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered, if the strict conditions for resection and follow-up are respected.	2.555522795798897
Most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic.	2.4374648609521707
Besides the known effects of beta-blockers, among true antiarrhythmic drugs only amiodarone seemed to reduce total cardiac mortality in patients at risk.	2.0897420911613858
Reevaluation of amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker in primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death after review of recent publications.	2.102192445426758
Only augmentation of case numbers by meta-analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality.	1.9365970382388529
However, the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases.	2.6560328916256846
This and specific side effects of amiodarone contradict a general primary prophylaxis with this drug.	2.3812637228527564
An additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta-blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies.	2.266688400760589
At present, primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations.	2.088637391014492
As a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey at German epilepsy centers of usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following strategy is recommended:	2.412356620887644
An ecological theory of remembering is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment.	2.270118064227378
The specific ecological relationship to the environment is affinitive, and also opens access to the ressources of the past.	2.0873355506959586
In the present study, conditions for this access (in particular with older people) were investigated.	2.2150982081387007
It is assumed that older people, especially, when they lose someone with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment, such as moving to a home, are rejected by older people.	1.9333892261175125
These hypotheses were checked on the basis of material (N=120) gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed.	2.028429059050602
To make matters clear, "typical" and thus every-day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material.	1.918519114955305
Finally, practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged.	2.5169800150538535
Following Shouldice repair of a primary inguinal hernia 50 patients were given subcutaneous Redon drains, while another 50 patients underwent operations without drains in a prospective randomized trial.	2.0268632868808094
The amount of postoperative wound secretion in the drainage bottle was added to fluid retention established by sonographic volumetric analysis.	1.877351466724315
The degree of personal impairment was estimated by a visual analogue score.	2.3210382756357926
Inflammation parameters were recorded as well as the rate of complications.	3.3796752461066855
The drain group showed significantly increased fluid production in comparison to the group without drains on the 1st postoperative day (36.0 vs. 2.5 ml).	2.1588596004199143
Wound sepsis was found in two patients in the drain group.	3.2386501915756996
Seven patients with drains and eight patients without underwent percutaneous seroma puncture.	1.9977702296642192
The drain only slightly affected personal impairment (25.6 % vs 21.4 %, visual analogue score).	1.9241253173054085
Body temperature was elevated in the drain group on the 3rd day after operation (37.2 vs 36.7  °C).	1.9547081731150864
We believe there is no indication for the routine use of a Redon drain in the repair of a primary inguinal hernia.	2.480822704238131
Instead, percutaneous puncture of subcutaneous fluid retentions should be performed.	2.1347120766864625
We report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement.	2.0088260829171056
As a result of implanted cement/spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component, the iliac vessels were compressed.	1.9751082416860088
Furthermore, we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65-year-old patient during a revision operation.	2.278735559857153
We recommend that in case of acute ischemic syndromes of lower limbs following total hip replacement, an angiography should be performed in order to exclude an extravascular cause of thrombosis.	2.4886457923171963
For therapy in those cases extra-anatomic bypasses should be preferred to thrombectomies.	2.2948337691155145
One of the most important occupations of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints.	2.6436403086648057
Such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or mobilisations.	2.371727219187287
The pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion.	2.329729376748855
They are not detectable in X-ray, computertomography or NMR.	2.489682865153828
In this article, we report on a family in which five examined members showed clinical signs of Fechtner syndrome, a condition which consists of hearing loss (49%), macrothrombocytopenia (100%), leukocyte inclusion bodies (100%), eye anomalies (54.3%), and nephritis (38.7%).	2.1206333308324266
This article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es.	1.7610517420172
Standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained.	2.266354343880133
Different models of in vitro culture - monolayer, three-dimensional tumor cultures, and organ cultures - are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret ation of in vivo tissue.	2.0131551747967413
Two important recent extensions of tissue culture, serum-free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells, are described.	2.1020448843251645
The objective of this prospective, randomised study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) during the first 24 h postoperatively.	2.7777758326446267
For a quality assurance study on PONV, we compared two established general anaesthetic procedures in 239 patients undergoing four different types of surgery (subtotal thyroidectomy, laparotomy for gynaecological procedures, laparoscopy, and surgery for extra-abdominal procedures).	1.8613143229669635
The historical opinion that the intima layer of a ruptured artery of muscular type could stop bleeding by "rolling in" should be controlled experimentally.	1.8594135159100302
Five segments of human femoral/popliteal artery (3-4 cm long) were overstretched until complete rupture occured.	2.220640092012149
Furthermore a longitudinally split and a partially oblique incised segment were ruptured.	2.00930512889481
As morphological findings a sandclock deformity was observed in the region of rupture.	2.6179617826081936
This phenomenon was induced by adventitia layer, which closed the ends of ruptured media layer like a Chinese finger trap.	1.8948690089942875
In the longitudinally split segment a transverse rupture of the media layer could be observed, while the fibers of adventitia layer were pulled out when the traction was continued.	2.096463762900136
Neither macroscopical nor microscopical signs could be found for "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	1.9559363620422259
The reason for spontaneous hemostasis after arterial rupture is more likely the activation of platelets by collagenous fibers of adventitia layer than "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	1.750928720415445
If there is no finger trap mechanism of adventitia layer like in shot- or stabwounds a massive blood loss must be expected.	1.972727963766283
Time and again a lack of staff in the field of people's nursing is discussed (chronic lack of nursing staff); this means that there are not enough people to do the available work) (1).	2.102538362437919
However, the time factor is also an important sociological dimension in old people's stationary care.	2.099021935256314
First of all, this article points out the time dimension throughout life.	2.1753703104977817
This is followed by people's varying perceptions of the present and the related upsets and misunderstandings.	2.3400098796517828
Hereby the contradictory abundance and limitation in time as felt by the elderly also becomes apparent.	2.017230874582932
The old people's awareness of the dwindling remainder of their own lifespans conflicts with the seemingly endless time of each day that passes.	1.8215792616313873
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology.	1.9986843548713513
The main reason is the capability to obtain "in-vivo" micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo-transducers with an outer diameter of 2.9-3.5 French.	2.015701799818467
For the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on lumenograms but also on vessel wall assessment.	2.3517393039278134
The capabilities of IVUS can be divided in its diagnostic and intervention associated potentials.	2.2052391980272854
The diagnostic strength of IVUS is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis, to assess intermediate lesions, to reveal occult left main stem disease, and angiographically "silent" arteriosclerosis.	1.9368877323640357
In conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve, patients with the diagnosis of coronary "syndrome X" can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis.	2.435270589099969
Additionally, IVUS is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the AHA/ACC Stary classification.	2.389760575488884
Introduction: The chronic exertional compartment syndrome of the musculus tibialis anterior is thought to be responsible for a major part of complaints of the lower leg among active sportsmen.	2.158971598708172
There is an important role of tissue pressure measurement in diagnosing chronic anterior compartment syndrome during muscular activity.	2.4563733441031355
However, there is a controversial debate about the relevant parameters.	2.3882456272858454
The development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto-orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature.	1.915641228291899
In a retrospective study on 33 patients (15 girls and 18 boys) the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically.	2.4853004634636746
Only patients with a minimum age of 6 years and with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included.	2.7355789244364574
The radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of pneumatisation at or above the level of the supraorbital rims, as projected in postero-anterior cephalograms.	1.9287564197561062
According to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72.7% of our patients.	2.3886034420584616
There was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient, age at surgery or the amount of advancement.	2.367539741041634
With the exception of severe cases of Crouzon's disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto-orbital correction.	2.139463615134434
Favourable results can be obtained with the standard four-screw technique, preservation of the ankle and the biomechanical axes seeing only one non-union in 44 own cases with this technique.	2.2454330941291984
A vital X-ray imaging technique in oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery is the panoramic X-ray.	2.4611560948204203
Due to its variety of special projections, including imaging of the transversal level and low exposure to radiation, it is suitable for answering many clinical questions and for diagnostics of various findings.	2.1178576303111303
It has become possible to minimize the necessary doses by further development of technology and devices, as well as of X-ray films and by new detection systems, such as sensors or screens.	2.439749703053083
In some clinical cases, the diagnostic deficiencies of conventional imaging techniques make computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging indispensable.	2.184055002888641
Although MR is particularly suitable for soft tissue imaging, it has also become helpful in finding cortical changes by shorter measuring times.	1.9944806472612309
In certain cases, e. g., changes to bone metabolism, differentiated methods of nuclear medicine make image-aided analysis of function possible.	2.0735834816472973
Secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than 1 % of patients with Salmonella infections.	2.658526798058
These atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre-existing local or systemic disease.	2.2814123240505437
We present a case of a patient with known alcohol abuse who developed a septic infection of her right hip requiring resection of the femoral head.	2.4356552820614144
Cartilage and bone were invaded and destructed by an aggressive granulation tissue.	2.110679116380236
Initially, a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour.	2.1235577577322924
The onset, clinical course, diagnosis and therapy of joint involvement by Salmonella are discussed with regard to our case and the relevant literature.	2.496148526740714
This case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist.	2.4387144941461227
Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), which becomes manifest before the age of 40, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin.	2.3986041707932477
Type II, the non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), develops in the elderly and is caused by a relative insulin deficiency.	2.4609324715476544
Patients with type-I diabetes are prone to the development of ketoacidosis, while type II causes hyperglycaemic, hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma.	2.108510878356678
Apart from these acute metabolic alterations, the long-term complications of diabetes are of concern to the anaesthesiologist.	2.2369909171234714
Hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency and autonomic neuropathy are common and can result in myocardial ischaemia, cardiovascular instability and gastroparesis, with an increased risk of aspiration.	2.4642004538242417
Limited movement of the atlanto-occipital joint can cause difficult intubation.	2.2335281017777326
To avoid perioperative metabolic catastrophy, blood glucose concentration should be kept between 6.7 and 10 mmol - l-1 (120 - 180 mg - dl-1).	1.9572207777281363
Hypoglycaemia can result in neurological damage, whereas hyperglycaemia causes impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infections and worsens ischaemic damage to the myocardium and brain.	2.1595077665412474
Perioperative diabetes management depends on the severity of the surgical procedure and the type of diabetes.	2.9784228615336947
All type-I diabetics, whatever operation being performed, need insulin.	2.107842755159824
The intravenous route is recommended as it allows better adjustment.	2.382908580908467
After determination of the fasting blood glucose level, insulin is given at a dosage of 0.5 - 1 U - h-1 (at gluc<11.1 mmol - l-1), 1.5 - 2 U - h-1 (at gluc 11.1 - 16.7 mmol - l-1) or 3  U - h-1 (at gluc>16.7 mmol - l-1).	1.9227009070779657
In addition, 5 - 10 g glucose - h-1 is given.	2.5052070359477367
In type-II diabetes the oral antidiabetic drug is withheld.	2.1606983921828586
During minor surgery the blood glucose concentration is monitored frequently, and if necessary insulin (with gluc>13.9 mmol - l-1) or glucose is given.	1.9996193487354645
In most cases of major surgery insulin therapy will be necessary.	2.306485370239227
Administration should follow the guidelines listed for type-I diabetes.	2.213135089850085
Whether the intravenous or the subcutaneous route is used for insulin, repeated glucose determinations are mandatory.	2.0494968108640648
If ketoacidosis develops the volume depletion is treated with normal saline.	2.2304787979084066
For hyperglycaemia and acidosis insulin (3 - 6 U - h-1) with 10 - 20 mmol - h-1 potassium phosphate is given.	2.3222552495442184
Bicarbonate is only indicated when the serum pH is lower than 7.1.	2.381978740041975
It must be borne in mind that perioperative management of diabetes does not end with postanaesthesia care.	1.9443259216029511
At the beginning of the 19 th century, institutional care for the insane was established by the various German states.	2.038311626535393
At first, the separation of curable and incurable patients influenced psychiatric care and the construction of hospitals.	2.041970569858991
The combination of care and cure in one hospital in Illenau was a turning point in institutional care.	1.9828692810673638
Contradictory tendencies characterized the second half of the 19 th century: the integration with general medicine in the cities, on the one hand, the social separation and cure in the seclusion of the countryside, on the other.	2.040379470955322
The characteristic psychiatric construction in different countries was influenced by individual architects.	2.066479476415724
The following building styles were dominant: in England, panoptic architecture; in the United States, linear staggered structures; in France, the "carrés isolés"; and in Germany, the structure of blocks with cross-axes.	1.869969204202497
At the end of the 19 th century, the system of pavilions was internationally accepted; occupational therapy and mental care in the countryside were introduced.	1.9399863858285475
From the First World War until the end of the 1960 s, a standstill in psychiatric buildings was noted in Germany, and institutional care came under increasing criticism.	2.055520711694763
There was a reorientation from the middle of the 1970 s as a result of more effective therapeutic possibilities.	2.240801631645466
A variety of complementary institutions, outpatient and partly inpatient therapies, which were recommended by the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", started to be realized.	2.0410250763459667
Smaller units and different models of integration of psychiatric care, such as building the hospital next to a general hospital or psychiatric wards within a general hospital, became relevant criteria for planning the construction of psychiatric hospitals, as did the integration into the community and the city.	2.0293377893543383
Principles of organization like the construction of a communicative quiet inner room, or grading the rooms from public to private, were structurally integrated.	1.8014042771356402
Specific structural requirements for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals should be evaluated in more detail by post-occupancy methods.	2.1489958702871355
The coronal incision is a versatile approach to midface or skull base fractures.	2.0268832023690746
It allows the open reduction of complex fracture sites and facilitates canthopexy, marginotomy or calvarian bone harvesting.	1.9355120762939226
By this method, primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced.	2.5147972332431334
The complication rate was low and the advantages of these techniques are evident, so that it is suggested that the indication for this operative approach should be extended.	2.5038803196142445
One case of a newly described, rare odontogenic tumor is reported.	2.5066439520182655
A literature review of 19 cases lends support to the odontogenic origin and metastatic capability, both regionally and distantly, of the clear cell odontogenic tumor.	1.8742764050863046
We conclude that this tumor is malignant, with a tendency to recur locally after surgery.	2.433816311309344
It requires an aggressive surgical approach and should be referred to as a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma.	2.4158364539203325
In our patient we saw a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma, both with regional lymph node metastasis.	2.1990519230159697
The histological differentiation of this type of tumor from other clear cell tumors is difficult.	2.3147683456313524
As the elderly segment of our population expands, there is an increase of therapeutic problems considering this age group.	2.3645054007178667
The elderly patient is generally susceptible to infections because of the decline in host defense mechanisms that occurs with aging, and the underlying chronic diseases of these patients.	2.3499657409671433
Increasing numbers of elderly people are being treated in hospitals and are additionally at particular risk of acquiring nosocomial infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms.	1.9707963871078822
This article focuses on the epidemiological considerations, risk factors, types of infections that occur in elderly patients, and the guidelines for empiric therapy.	2.574227123663634
The most common infections of the elderly are respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infection.	2.399781326523972
Empirical therapy should be broader in spectrum for elderly patients since the variety of infecting bacteria tends to be greater and the choice of antimicrobial therapy must be based on risk stratification (age, medical illnesses, and severity of presentation).	2.0377107106866617
Many additional aspects, e.g., route of administration, drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, drug toxicity and drug-drug interactions, compliance, and multiple underlying diseases (e.g., renal failure) must be considered in the rational selection of antibiotic regimen.	2.0789949404857695
We present long-term results (minimum follow-up 5 years) in 145 patients with advanced non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, who underwent radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLA) after chemotherapy.	2.3113423941560023
We correlated patients' outcomes (death of disease) to different kinds of chemotherapy and to intraoperative findings.	2.116007471759919
We found that patients who were treated by a modified Einhorn scheme with cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin have a good prognosis.	2.2023224619877593
In all, 90 % showed no evidence of disease (NED).	2.281743309817864
The NED rate was significantly lower in patients who were treated by sequential alternative chemotherapy (DOD = 37 %).We determined the following prognostic factors which predict a poor outcome:...	2.2245869344731446
Follow-up studies after stent implantation of native coronary arteries have reported reduced rates of angiographic restenosis.	2.040107586093885
In contrast, stent implantation in the treatment of obstructive disease of coronary artery bypass grafts is complicated by higher restenosis rates.	2.6068273406182927
We sought to determine, if different predictors contribute to the high restenosis rate following stent implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts.	2.4878476923998205
We investigated long-term angiographic outcome of 205 stent implantations performed in 177 patients.	2.326287141245057
Multivariate analysis correlated clinical, procedural and angiographic variables with the incidence of angiographic restenosis defined as diameter stenosis >50% at follow-up.	2.06555227003728
Angiographic restenosis was observed in 34% of lesions treated.	2.763596576008234
Multiple logistic regression analysis defined diabetes mellitus (OR 6.89, CI2.41-9.69), graft recanalization (OR 2.69, CI 1.08-6.63), lesion at the aortic anastomosis (OR6.98, CI2.76-19.25), lesion at the coronary anastomosis (OR 2.95, CI1.18-7.49), high diameter stenosis after stent placement (OR 7.01, CI 2.64-15.71), placement of long stents (OR2.78, CI1.11-7.36) and implantation of more than one stent (OR7.34, CI2.08-20.15) as independent predictors of graft in-stent restenosis.	1.6207719773287808
Critical consideration of these variables may help to identify patients who are poor candidates for stent implantation and who may benefit from different interventional approaches.	2.2854419785743234
To compare the conventional 2-D, the simulator-guided semi-3-D and the recently developed CT-guided 3-D brachytherapy treatment planning in the interstitial radiotherapy of breast cancer.	2.0577029524788157
In 103 patients with T1-2, N0-1 breast cancer the tumor bed was clipped during breast conserving surgery.	2.056561924254887
Fifty-two of them received boost brachytherapy after 46 to 50 Gy teletherapy and 51 patients were treated with brachytherapy alone via flexible implant tubes.	2.0373427703125175
Single, double and triple plane implant was used in 6, 89 and 8 cases, respectively.	2.1695248966967036
The dose of boost brachytherapy and sole brachytherapy prescribed to dose reference points was 3 times, 4.75 Gy and 7 times 5.2 Gy, respectively.	1.7380041484501196
The positions of dose reference points varied according to the level (2-D, semi-3-D and 3-D) of treatment planning performed.	2.5038455440618295
The treatment planning was based on the 3-D reconstruction of the surgical clips, implant tubes and skin points.	2.71887020544991
In all cases the implantations were planned with a semi-3-D technique aided by simulator.	2.0948182437178953
In 10 cases a recently developed CT-guided 3-D planning system was used.	2.2674946821684925
The values of mean central dose, mean skin dose, minimal clip dose, proportion of underdosaged clips and mean target surface dose were evaluated.	1.830387543633195
The accuracy of tumor bed localization and the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were also analyzed in each technique.	1.976070955892483
With the help of conformal semi-3-D and 3-D brachytherapy planing we could define reference dose points, active source positions and dwell times individually.	1.8688688073506992
This technique decreased the mean skin dose with 22.2% and reduced the possibility of geographical miss.	2.2027314971042804
We could achieve the best conformity between the planning target volume and the treated volume with the CT-image based 3-D treatment planning, at the cost of worse dose homogeneity.	2.099700017812815
The mean treated volume was reduced by 25.1% with semi-3-D planning, however, it was increased by 16.2% with 3-D planning, compared to the 2-D planning.	2.8539644591345263
The application of clips into the tumor bed and the conformal (semi-3-D and 3-d) planning help to avoid geographical miss.	1.9235057627957963
CT is suitable for 3-D brachytherapy planning.	3.070903640308705
Better local control with less side effects might be achieved with these new techniques.	2.3015288146745463
Conformal 3-D brachytherapy calls for new treatment planning concepts, taking the irregular 3-D shape of the target volume into account.	2.336570306989859
The routine clinical application of image-based 3-D brachytherapy is a real aim in the very close future.	2.206779539976005
Background: Staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye.	2.3029198488306974
In addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found.	2.0717200467120573
Microbiallergic and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology.	2.4719059089603106
Multiple organ failure (MOF) may occur early or late after trauma.	2.2049128625746217
Besides direct physical injury of organs, compromise of the microcirculation by inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MOF.	2.157381126809915
Inflammation also induces counterregulatory responses which may end up in immunoparalysis.	2.1287184656331126
As a result, infection and sepsis with additional inflammatory damage to the microcirculation ensue thereby contributing to the late development of MOF.	1.9731205355777028
In addition to this biphasic model of posttraumatic MOF, there is evidence that inflammation and immunoparalysis do not only occur in sequence to each other but in parallel early after surgical procedures.	1.9745403572364597
The aim of the present brief review is to summarize the posttraumatic mechanisms of inflammation and immunoparalysis and to discuss how to differentiate between both pathophysiologic states.	2.0536866371606717
Early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function ("gut injury hypothesis") and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or postinjury patients.	1.932482580504932
Nineteen severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score 40.3+/-11.6) were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube.	1.9589284575201582
Despite maxillary fractures, rhinoliquorrhea and blunt abdominal trauma the enteral feeding was mostly started immediately after trauma.	1.9775693337458404
Intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within 1 or 2 days.	2.2619589489881835
Total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases; a central venous line was always additionally necessary.	2.630138583973233
However, the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut.	2.0228564760982213
The study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients.	1.9080211776146891
The expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified.	2.5902806576952844
Enterally fed patients may have a better outcome that those in whom only parenteral is employed.	2.330009288532234
Definition of the problem: The rapid pace of medical progress has drawn renewed attention to the various possible ways of treating dead or brain-dead pregnant women since the 1980's.	1.792307840369842
The discussion today revolves around medical, social, legal and economic aspects.	2.1173767263014343
The historical areas of conflict which surrounded deliveries carried out on dead mothers (usually by means of a Sectio in mortua, nowadays known as a perimortem Caesarean section) and their significance in today's debate are, for the most part, regarded as being of little relevance.	1.895629740675351
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients, especially in AIDS cases.	2.495895963397348
The present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign-body reaction in a patient with successfully treated PCP who was known to have AIDS.	2.2149552013733453
This form of residues of completely healed PCP tends to be rare.	2.0890352762122846
Other infectious granulomas, foreign-body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed.	1.9895298883767396
After cautious decalcification, pneumocysts can be demonstrated with methamine silver (Grocott).	1.9921718694763217
It is important to be aware that PCP can also undergo spontaneous cure, so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of AIDS.	2.169801480670638
Background: In congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency high pre- and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence psychosexual and psychosocial development in affected girls.	1.854362853675566
Methods: In order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality-of-life study.	2.5055551482763945
Results: The patients were socially competent with a well developed social network.	2.293632582931628
However, regarding sexual contacts they were shy and reluctant.	2.080966812803829
These resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are married.	2.0532598757636125
Existing partnerships were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population.	2.587445207559743
The incidence of homosexuality was not increased.	2.2670377704340394
The number of women having children was significantly reduced.	2.195561365890376
A substantial number of women suffered from androgen-dependent problems like irrgular menses and hirsutism.	2.0245070924531503
Mothers and patients denied any sex-specific eduction, but the girls had preferred boy-specific toys and competitive outdoor games.	1.9652112098405168
However, school performance was average and comparable to the controls.	2.3077547534021883
Most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters intersexuality at birth.	2.017581059810349
Even though they felt they had received good medical treatment, mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help.	2.175189761821589
Conclusions: It seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease.	2.122434878238566
Problems regarding partnership, sexuality, and fertility remain and have to be addressed.	2.378703549257029
Introduction: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become an accepted treatment for end-stage liver disease.	2.1988349337349002
However, postoperative complications result in significant patient morbidity and mortality.	2.2849735176941643
Early detection and treatment of these complications is therefore of utmost importance.	2.587853579189999
Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the postoperative complications of the patients who underwent OLT at our institution.	2.620185576774675
Duplex Doppler sonography and cholangiography were the primary imaging modalities in postoperative evaluation of the transplanted liver.	2.6362439078116324
Other important techniques were CT, MRI, and angiography, which may contribute to a reliable diagnosis of vascular or biliary complications.	2.289819544701789
Results: Second to primary organ dysfunction, vascular complications are the most frequent cause of graft loss.	2.40213832909641
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery is the most common and most serious vascular complication, with a reported incidence from 4 to 42 %.	2.3443891473531764
Bile duct sludge, leaks and strictures are frequent complications after liver transplantation, which can contribute to graft dysfunction.	2.1905581245803165
Biliary tract complications usually occur within the first 3 months and require interventional radiological or surgical therapy.	2.2237118596529664
Since liver transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive therapy, they are at increased risk of developing late post-transplant malignancies, which are best depicted by US, CT or MRI.	2.3116244803943324
However, radiological diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorder has to be confirmed by liver biopsy.	2.493641062713748
Conclusion: Cholangiography and Duplex sonography are routinely used in the postoperative evaluation of patients with OLT.	2.8667498971059495
CT, MRI, and angiography are problem-solving tools in equivocal cases.	2.2379839933905727
Recurrence of colorectal carcinomas occurs in about 50 % of the cases with localized neoplasia.	2.5752545609308037
It is understood that the tumor recurrence is due to residual micrometastases not found during surgery or extraregional (peripheral blood or bone marrow).	1.9735201351807539
We developed a procedure to detect non-visible, abdominal metastases using a radiolabeled anti-tumor cell antibody injected before the operation (radioimmunoguided surgery, RIGS).	1.8902238719110642
However, even with the best technique, it is not possible to remove all micrometastasis if a hematogenic dissemination happens.	2.314154737577505
Based on the knowledge of disturbing humoral immune reaction is mounted against shed tumor associated antigens (TAA), we developed a new method to reduce and correct the B cell response and B cell recruitment due to chronic TAA immun complex presentation on follicular dendritic cells (immune corrective surgery, ICS).	1.7709531961042095
This method is based on a selective lymphadenectomy.	2.8917938022494445
The target lymph nodes were those loaded with TAA-immune complex.	2.1230222039776683
From 20 patients (stage I, II and III) treated with ICS, 17 survived more than 5 years ' showing a statistically significant increase of survival compared to patients treated with standard procedures.	2.1582748329165784
In conclusion, these data show that surgery of colorectal cancer should be selectively extended to specific anatomical regions in order to remove hidden micrometastases, and more importantly, correct postoperative immune processes that could suppress the T cell response against residual tumor cells.	2.014637087791405
Knowledge of normal and impaired pulmonary gas exchange is essential to the anaesthesiologist.	2.437055362504482
Analysis of an arterial blood sample allows evaluation of whether or not pulmonary gas exchange is normal.	2.235156590704623
For this purpose comparison with the oxygenation index or the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference is helpful.	2.067211483633825
Pathological changes of these variables are mainly caused by ventilation-perfusion (V.A/Q.)	2.19053880501807
In daily practice, venous admixture or intrapulmonary shunt can be calculated using arterial and mixed-venous blood.	2.0792863615110053
By analysing arterial and expired PCO2, dead-space ventilation can be determined, but extended analyses of V.A/Q.	1.8348313062351387
distribution are not possible in daily practice.	2.7786781070703666
However, knowledge of the principles of typical disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange in acute and chronic lung disease allows the use of therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiological changes.	2.6670948747251724
Background: Infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions.	2.3591338562584228
The case of a 30 year old man with acatalasemia is presented.	2.4095500767716733
The congenital disorder  is charaterized by a lack or major reduction of catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.	1.7442416200299469
The defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.	2.3045616851758006
Occasionally the defect manifests as progressive oral gangrene or Takahara's, disease.	1.9950672695505578
Poor longterm success has been reported for penile vein ligation the last few years.	2.261386635624468
Therefore, we decided to re-investigate our group of 147 patients who were operated on between 1987 and 1996.	2.280691016071098
All patients showed a negative response to intracavernous injection therapy at the time of diagnosis and revealed a maintenance flow > 15 ml/min, as well as a pathological venous flow with pharmacocavernosometry or pharmacocavernosography.	2.3928943089091264
These patients underwent ligation of all superficial dorsal veins and resection of the deep dorsal vein of the penis.	2.3041076296454728
An up-to-date record of the success of the operation was kept either by a renewed clinical visit or by a standardized telephone interview or questionnaire.	2.2329541874289753
A total of 126 patients were available here for long-term follow-up.	2.279922560165305
We divided the findings into three groups: complete spontaneous erection, postoperative response to cavernous auto-injection therapy and no changes in erectile competency postoperatively.	1.8765178733802348
The short-term success rate for these groups after 1-3 months was an outcome of 31 (24.6 %), 25 (19.8 %) and 70 (55.6 %) patients; 86 % of the cases whose results deteriorated after the initial operation success rate had this happen within the first postoperative year (p K 0.001).	2.056712846775043
Favorable prognostic factors were preoperative erectile dysfunction of K 7 years, a normal CC-EMG and a maintenance flow of K 45 ml/min.	2.077624063779266
If all three parameters were present, the long-term success rate (spontaneous erection plus response to intracavernous injection) of 30 % of all patients was found to rise to 67 % in this selected group of patients (p K 0.001).	2.3670472235140565
This study reveals that long-term success for unselected patients undergoing penile venous surgery is disappointing; however, careful selection of patients by certain prognostic factors can improve long-term results.	2.1544749576983238
Pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems.	2.302922646470121
High dosed corticosteroids are the treatment of choice.	2.6695778779753114
However, recalcitrant pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives.	1.8968519502112948
Pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine A.	2.310997849168674
Because of side effects and drug interactions, the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored.	2.4662477331446353
Six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum, unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies, were treated with oral cyclosporine A at mean daily doses of approximately 3 mg/kg.	2.109563394617072
Marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3-6 months.	3.0912394340100007
Only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment.	2.444765263515736
No severe irreversible side effects occurred.	2.3986116880064237
The results show that low-dose cyclosporine A treatment can be considered a first-line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum.	2.480005639301338
Medical treatment of injured patients by international missions of non-governmental organisations in crisis areas and out-of-area operations by troops, and also national disasters require special trauma management.	1.9623312361647345
Deviations from peacetime surgical guidelines are obligatory because of long-distance medical evacuation, the possibility of gaps in supply and the typical pattern of war injuries.	2.0526677670878617
Massive contamination combined with the high risk of infection is one typical attribute of wounds inflicted during a war or a disaster.	2.3530108104261673
In contrast to peacetime surgical guidelines, aggressive wound débridement is often needed.	1.9815887001079613
Timely and prophylactically prescription of a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a long half-life has great importance in the treatment of these wounds.	2.4490536617406873
Nevertheless the use of antimicrobial agents will only be effective with early surgical débridement.	2.45439247272207
Craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis.	2.3616722101508274
The aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth, correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth.	2.329508941898484
The patient population consisted of 71 children; the postoperative follow-up time in 57 patients was more than 12 months.	2.2842469709792774
Of the children followed up, 36 were male and 21 female.	2.1946892012664794
Thirty-six cases involved untreated non-syndromic craniosynostosis; the remaining 21 were syndrome cases.	1.913495419717934
The patient ages ranged from 16 to 27 months.	2.1656384578765464
In 11 cases correction of an occipital craniosynostosis was carried out.	2.2145664813477826
The fronto-occipital circumference was registered in accordance with Prader's percentile table.	2.1660266560533064
The operative method included a fronto-parietal craniotomy, the temporary removal and shaping of the fronto-orbital band and a vault cranioplasty.	1.817339700914067
During follow-up 13 patients treated with fronto-orbital advancement in cases of isolated craniosynostosis remained in the registered percentile curve.	2.5595903595236558
In 13 patients a change to a lower percentile curve was confirmed; 1 patient changed to a higher curve.	2.2354273819283743
In cases of syndromic craniosynostosis 10 patients remained in the post-operatively registered percentile curve; 8 patients changed to a lower and 1 patient to a higher percentile curve.	2.135985202421881
No growth restriction of the reshaped calvaria after surgical correction of craniosynostosis was observed.	2.1518911847287217
No significant difference was found in the potential calvaria growth between syndromic and isolated craniosynostosis.	2.4305356899994317
Today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques.	2.580634903420105
The retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach.	2.142416364121571
The overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the magnifying effect of the laparoscope, which is, furthermore, positioned very close to the operative field.	2.6134999189346035
It is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation.	2.361421839993453
The decisive anatomical aspects and landmarks in different minimally invasive operations on retroperitoneal organs are outlined.	1.9540536042306265
Lipid peroxidation is considered a prominent feature of age-related retinal degeneration.	2.4682775991149284
It is known that lipid peroxides can oxidize benzidine.	2.0728413957327714
This property was used to localize lipid peroxides ultrastructurally in the retina.	2.278103432743365
In a 73 year-old male patient with generalized atherosclerosis, known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, and coronary artery disease, an aneurysm of the proximal left subclavian artery was successfully excluded by implantation of a JOSTENTTM-Peripheral stent graft.	2.236481853400813
Angiographic follow up after 6 and 12 months showed an excellent outcome with complete exclusion of the aneurysm.	2.382727706044605
Intravascular ultrasound showed no neo-intimal hyperplasia within the stent.	2.0799631961443708
A computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis of the aneurysm.	2.6380061870237728
Based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in RA patients, new therapeutic principles have been developed, aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines.	1.9369431922730667
Both principles, however, have proven to be very effective.	3.0946267986199096
In addition, the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable, followed by a first, very carefully formulated protocol for human RA.	1.919998703061329
Gene therapy for RA has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage, not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to RA patients.	2.168092672781209
Several problems, such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved.	2.8640994046108763
With more experiments this therapeutic principle might become available and might prove effective even in a disease with a systemic character like RA in the coming years.	1.9302313998980156
Patients with bony and discoligamentous lesions have to be excluded, as well as patients with distinct neurologic deficits.	2.7272792440935416
A therapeutic rationale is the basis of full neuromuscular recovery ad integrum.	2.5190724032948677
The news of success in ether anesthesia on 16 October 1846 in Boston spread like wildfire through Europe.	1.7904459919219338
In the German-speaking countries, the national newspapers as conveyers of the development played a prominent role; this was especially the case for the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung whose correspondent, Aloys Martin [1], was a medical professional.	1.8291904187515051
The function of local newspapers has not yet been investigated.	2.4089809111579337
This was to be remedied by examining both of Bamberg's local papers.	2.0805334520353176
All issues from 01.01. to 31.04.1847 were surveyed with respect to relevant announcements.	2.1604728999595118
These were then catalogued according to date, extent and contents.	2.122051443474766
Starting on 22.01.1847, the events outside of and in Bamberg were reported on in 26 notices and articles of just a few lines to half a page and in advertisements; Aloys Martin also appears on the scene.	1.6896378195430253
Thus, the local press in Bamberg also informed its readers early and regularly on the discovery of ether and the succeeding events.	1.8078524162005787
True arterial aneurysms of the infrapopliteal vessels are a rare finding.	2.361062421765189
During surgical treatment of convergent aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk.	2.3972120158339103
We describe the special features of diagnosis, histology, and the surgical treatment of aneurysms of the crural arteries.	2.695818438805986
We recommend that even asymptomatic aneurysms be electively operated on to prevent further complications.	1.9886439677914611
Dementia is going to be one of the major challenges of the next century for our societies due to the enormous burden on the health care systems.	2.3650821710693797
Dementia is the major cause of death and the most important risk factor for disability and entry into a nursing home in elderly people.	2.5349110766412424
Moreover, because of the progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, in particular with the cholinesterase inhibitors, demented people will be more often and detected earlier by general practitioners and families.	2.5142263990439684
Nowadays operative sperm retrieval in connection with assisted reproduction is a well-established procedure in urological-gynecological cooperative groups.	2.1667638428279865
Microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) and testicular sperm extraction (TESE) are the fundamental procedures in cases of non-reconstructable obstructive azoospermia or testicular azoospermia.	2.164049145164972
As they are often favored percutaneous techniques such as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) or percutaneous testicular sperm extraction (PTESE), need to be in Anglo-American countries and the countries of northern Europe, discussed regarding their efficacy (number of retrieved spermatozoa) and possible testicular injury due to blind or ultrasound-guided puncture.	1.7112866885693292
In Middle Franconia, one of the larger Bavarian administrative division (population 1994: 1,657,101), the number of patients suffering from cancer pain, chronic headache and chronic back pain is not known.	2.413082777628736
Furthermore, there are no data on interdisciplinary organization of outpatient pain management.	2.2974225914199917
A 34-year-old HIV-infected African woman developed fever, weight loss and widespread papules on her trunk, arms and face.	2.0528398194907647
Skin biopsy and culture revealed histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum varietas capsulatum (American histoplasmosis).	1.829930029459551
Even though antimycotic treatment and intensive care were started immediately the patient died because of the systemic mycosis within a few days.	2.5668262809398024
Histoplasmosis is a rare disease in Europe but endemic in some areas of the USA (e.g.	2.2897376908518567
Ohio, Mississippi) and of Africa.	2.625597512465232
Additionally histoplasma capsulatum varietas duboisii is endemic in Central and South Africa.	1.9970307116656054
As a consequence of scientific advances, an increasing number of patients with advanced age, reduced myocardial performance, previous cardiac surgery, comorbidities, and emergency indications are referred for cardiac surgery.	2.1835647644014875
This requires risk stratification to predict "low", "moderate", and "high" operative risk.	2.163398464616685
Risk factors can be divided into pre-, intra-, and postoperative patient-, structure-, and procedure-related.	2.3600032357279703
Unnoticed, minor damage to the unidirectional respiratory valves of the Draeger respiratory circuit may lead to intermittent and unpredictable malfunction, resulting in rebreathing and hypercapnia.	2.082959085870432
The damage may be so minor that normal visual and functional test routines may be insufficient to detect it.	1.8849587487774988
We report one case of a potential life-threatening malfunction of the inspiratory valve and also propose economical solutions utilizing altered construction, modified machine-check procedures, or a simple instrument that adds only one step to the machine-check procedure.	2.001721730488985
The general problem of minor but functionally important damage to parts of ventilatory equipment - so-called borderline damage - may not be limited to this particular model or manufacturer.	2.00553366375796
Most users of ventilatory equipment believe that equipment that goes through normal check procedures is either fully functional or non-functional.	1.9233494370127222
In reality, this is not the case.	3.334028801096507
Intermittent malfunctions due to slightly damaged equipment may be missed with normal machine-check procedures.	2.0168441105338553
This problem results in a significant but incalculable increased in risk to patients.	2.3267919731084623
Because of unclear reproduceability of intermittent malfunctions caused by borderline damage, there also is an increased forensic risk for the anaesthesiologist.	1.9796424686190706
The risk of mechanical malfunction might be displaced by software problems in new-generation ventilators in the market.	1.8381794955259494
Purpose: To investigate whether the margins of microscopic tumors can be delineated better with monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles (MION), a superparamagnetic contrast medium, than with Gd-DTPA by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	1.9072599793630098
Nonunion of the ankle malleoli is extremely rare these days.	2.630902992348576
This is probably due to the fact that primary osteosynthesis is performed in ankle fractures instead of the conservative treatment given up to 20 years ago.	2.4508397326825206
Today nonunions of the malleoli are seen, if at all, is infected cases after surgical procedures.	2.047867635033135
In painful cases, small fragments, especially of the medial malleolus, should be resected; larger fragments should be stabilized with two 3.5-mm cancellous screws.	2.173852776778013
Alternatively, the tension banding technique, especially after Weber A fracture, produces high compression in the area of nonunion.	2.0547850382150394
In cases of additional bony defects, a local upside down cortical-cancellous bone graft should be performed in addition.	2.17920377893
In summary, the therapeutic approach requires exact remodeling, bone-grafting and stabilization.	2.1657236148792665
Infected nonunions with loss of bone mass should be treated according to the guidelines for osteitis therapy.	2.713023732554997
This study investigated the influence of the patients' educational level on indication for and duration of psychotherapy and the choice of treatment methods (psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy or psychoanalysis).	2.7041693235017967
We considered treatments that were conducted within the framework of the statutory health insurance in Germany.	2.0811575219545086
Data were collected from the therapists' case history (n=274), submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies.	1.971559580428328
We found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy.	2.1484803069160234
In our sample 43.5% had graduated from senior high school compared with 25.1% in the average German population.	1.796370626792708
This relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.	1.9820666400561304
51.7% of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13.2% from junior high school compared with 48.7% in the average German population.	1.9824657777053354
Also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education, not on gender, age or type of statutory health insurance.	2.5457407113316974
These results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are deduced.	2.304469363002759
After the initial enthusiasm subsided lasercoagulation of the prostate has been criticized because the extent of tissue destruction cannot be controlled and many patients may be expected to have significant postoperative obstructive as well as irritative voiding symptoms which may last for weeks.	2.294352746873089
Thanks to new laservaporization techniques these disadvantages have been largely eliminated.	2.055711060038876
With the Holmium laser a real resection of prostatic tissue is possible allowing the surgeon to see the prostatectomy defect immediately and to assess tissue destruction during the operation ("what you see is what you get").	1.8564378116203213
The postoperative voiding disturbances are diminished and comparable to those after TUR-P.	2.1651260760813935
The classification of acetabular fractures and especially the diagnosis of additional lesions can be misleading, when the personal experience is limited and the decisions are based only on conventional radiographs.	2.371753478380547
The introduction of Spiral-CT with multiplanar reformations and 3-D views has improved the quality of visualization.	2.4255982828344176
Due to their higher costs, the need of these additional diagnostic tools is frequently questioned.	2.3079224817573967
This paper discusses the relevance of plain radiographs, 2-D-CTs, 3-D-CTs and Femursubtraction-CTs (FsCT) for the classification of acetabular fractures, based on a controlled study.	2.40771058695131
Methods: Thirty physicians with different levels of experience in acetabular surgery were divided in three groups of 10 each: group I comprised residents without operative experience in acetabular surgery, group II was physicians with 3-10 years of operative experience, and group III was experts in acetabular surgery.	2.0151913825540912
A total of 10 complete radiographic cases of high quality providing all levels of preoperative diagnostics (plain radiographs, 2-D-CT, CT with multiplanar reformation, 3-D-CT, Fs-CT) of different acetabular fracture types were prepared.	2.0100261013624503
The task for each candidate was to classify the fracture according to Letournel and to identify all additional injuries within the hip joint (e. g. marginal impaction, head fractures, etc.).	1.9810805147325994
The different diagnostic "levels" could be ordered stepwise according to personal need and no time limit was given.	1.873697862418114
The case was finished when the candidate presented his final diagnosis.	2.0740171678292647
The use of the different radiographs, the preliminary diagnosis, the changes in diagnosis, and the final decisions were recorded.	2.6513010609130254
These findings were correlated with the different levels of experience and against a "consensus classification" which was generated by thorough discussion, and the use of intraoperative information and postoperative radiographs not accessible to the candidates.	2.3650001488332406
Results: The "correct" fracture classification based on plain radiographs was: group I, 11 %; group II, 32 %; group III, 61 %.	2.1007497898957
Based on 2-D-CT a "correct" diagnosis was reached by 30 % in group I, by 55 % in group II, and by 76 % in group III.	2.466689521813974
With consideration of the "transient forms" in acetabular fractures based on Letournel and the 3-D-CT used mainly by group I, the rate of "correct" classifications rose to 65 % in group I, 64 % in group II and 83 % in group III.	2.2826863192966527
The modifiers were diagnosed "correctly" in group I by 37 %, in group II by 56 %, and in group III by 73 %.	2.5040983966408685
The use of the 3-D-CT and especially the Fs-CT by group I resulted in an improvement in the rate of correct classifications to 61 %, whereas in group II the Fs-Ct was used only exceptionally.	2.3453970223848732
In particular, the secondary reformations in CT and the 3-D-views dramatically improved the rate of "correct" classifications in the group of surgeons with limited personal experience in acetabular surgery.	2.230037910635939
This allows the less experienced an acceptable level of "correct" diagnoses, so that the treatment options can be weighed correctly.	2.1617791627181258
Among the "experts" a rate of divergent classifcations of approximately 20 % was observed, especially in "transient" forms of acetabular fractures.	2.344520138096608
Background: Iridodonesis is the clinical sign of lens subluxation.	2.333167651116627
Acute glaucoma caused by a ciliolenticular block may develop.	2.5325232776871656
YAG iridotomy or peripheral iridectomy are rarely effective in controlling intraocular pressure.	2.070743956781335
The results of phacoemulsification and posterior lens implantation for subluxated lens and glaucoma are reported.	1.8388948111054872
Cerebral perfusion reserve may be determined by assessing changes in cerebral blood flow using vasodilators.	2.2545722320385773
Transcranial Doppler (TCD) may be used to measure cerebral blood flow speed in response to such stimuli.	2.5684548615536733
The aim of this study was to analyze cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis and to determine the short- and long-term effects of desobliteration.	2.5452867352608566
A total of 40 patients had bilateral preoperative studies done and 24 were re-evaluated 1 year later.	1.9661988991547965
The preoperative vasomotor capacity using TCD with CO2 was 57% +/- 45.	2.0420071407474043
Hemodynamic reserve did not decrease significantly in the early postoperative period on the operated hemisphere, and 1 year later hemodynamic reserve had increased to to 102% +/- 80%.	2.1504813086203862
One year later patients with unilateral stenosis (n=11) presented with a restitution of reactivity to 65% +/- 46% after initial postoperative ipsilateral decrease from 51% +/- 35% to 48% +/- 38%.	1.8999092140901102
Patients with bilateral stenoses (n=9) demonstrated an initial decrease from 70% +/- 60% to 48% +/- 21% and a significant rise to 115% +/- 77% 1 year later (P=0.02).	1.974231577226744
Both the significant postoperative increase in the cerebral vasomotor capacity in patients with bilateral carotid stenoses registered in both hemispheres and long-term improvement in patients with unilateral stenosis underline the effectivity of carotid desobliteration in antiembolic prophylaxis and in cerebral blood flow increase, irrespective of the symptomatology.	2.2981811291646217
Chronic constipation can be divided in two large groups: slow-transit constipation, caused by pathological intestinal transit, and obstructive defecation disorder, caused by pelvic and rectal wall abnormalities.	2.0146441711542353
Videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are methods used to study dynamic evacuation of the rectum.	2.3389632392071205
Videodefecography also enables visual estimation of rectal evacuation.	2.3637272273699286
Defecoflowmetry allows analysis of anal and rectal pressures.	2.284221590089552
Within this prospective study we utilized and compared these methods in 19 patients with slow transit and 30 patients with obstructive disease.	2.403431489005329
In patients with slow transit, both investigations demonstrated a significantly higher defecation rate than in obstructive defecation disorder (slow transit: defecoflowmetry 65 %, videodefecography 80 %; obstructive defecation disorder: 50 % and 58 %).	1.8536037002333898
The evacuation time was pathologically prolonged in both types of constipation, with a range of 43-55 s. Rectoceles are demonstrated in 94 % of cases with slow transit and in 72 % with obstructive defecation disorder.	1.9337060195846962
Also, we often found obstructive components in slow-transit constipation patients.	2.031191492737291
We conclude that videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are important items in the complex diagnostic regimen needed in evaluation of chronic constipation.	1.91715700679997
Absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare developmental disorder of the human brain.	3.0229504094667847
Previous reports focused on the association with other cerebral anomalies.	2.4949593513079695
We present MRI scans showing an isolated absence of the septum pellucidum.	2.2348408804340765
Mental retardation or epileptic seizures, which are often found in more complex developmental brain disorders, were not observed.	2.335392129120223
The septal area is part of the limbic system and aplasia of the septum pellucidum could indicate developmental anomalies of the limbic system.	2.1959044935872307
The concept of cerebral maldevelopment and the limbic system in schizophrenic psychosis is discussed.	2.0826639956953206
History and clinical findings: A 61 year old man presented with newly developed tachyarrhythmia.	2.47193589063169
Echocardiographically a tumour of unclear origin in the left atrium was diagnosed.	2.5783724987055394
Investigations: The heart rate in the ECG was arrhythmic at 146/min; intermittently sinus rhythm was established.	2.216060954529935
Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a 90x50 mm tumour with sharp borders displacing both atria.	1.9856562643076847
The chest x-ray showed a mediastinal rounded mass in the dorsal part overlapping the right mediastinal border.	2.1868234829039737
Computer tomography was unable to discriminate the atrial wall from the tumour masses; hence the difference between an (intra-)cardiac tumour (i.e.	1.975520684828376
myxoma) and a tumour of extracardiac (mediastinal) origin could not be established.	2.5541858112645754
Additional magnetic resonance tomography led to the most probable diagnosis of a bronchogenic cyst, which spread ventrally up to the ascending aorta and dorsally to the paravertebral region, thus displacing and shrinking the left pulmonary artery and the left atrium.	2.392442074175038
Therapy: For certain exclusion of malignancy and because of displacement of other thoracic structures the patient was operated on this mediastinal mass by anterolateral thoracotomy.	2.103017925318038
Histologically a dysontogenetic, benign cyst with an inner layer of mesothel and nerval as well as vascular structures in the capsule was diagnosed.	2.169730222483492
Since the operation the patient has persistent sinus rhythm without symptoms of relevant rhythm disorders.	2.213348039615014
An overview of different kinds of intrathoracical cysts is given.	2.1477562128298198
Longstanding and untreated scaphoid fractures and scapholunate dissociations lead to painful destruction of the wrist with carpal collapse.	2.1807779905242817
The severity of degenerative arthrosis is classified in three stages and can be treated adaequate operatively.	2.31588743035335
SNAC wrist (scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse) after failed fusion of the scaphoid and SLAC wrist (scapholunate advanced collapse) after scapholunate dissociation should be differentiated.	1.8617700484017026
The reconstruction of the scaphoid or scapholunate ligament in stage II and III is no reasonable option.	2.43583133184106
Motion preserving procedures such as proximal row carpectomy or midcarpal arthrodesis are preferable in this situation.	1.9914100081664394
Thirty-one male patients (average 41 years) were treated for SNAC or SLAC wrist with midcarpal arthrodesis.	2.196342870682514
All patients were reexamined, the mean follow-up was 15 months.	2.567392880496115
Grip strength was measured with the Dexter-System, pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-100).	2.196366713083718
Patients' daily activities and general quality of life were estimated with the DASH-questionnaire.	2.252192013513123
Pain was reduced to 50% compared to the preoperative situation.	2.944415304909849
Grip strength improved to 60% of the opposite side.	2.5239945953348544
Active range of motion reached 50% of the contralateral wrist.	2.9521147703575976
Nonunion at the fusion site necessitated additional surgery in four patients resulting in total wrist arthrodesis.	2.1321186745192806
80% of the patients returned to their original occupation.	2.9119005939782787
Midcarpal fusion is a reliable procedure for treating the difficult condition of advanced carpal collapse is proper realignement of the carpus is performed.	1.9403749698444577
The DASH-score reflects the subjective impressions of the patients in daily life and justifies the choice of a salvage procedure preserving wrist mobility.	2.2873765169450384
Total wrist fusion represents the last line of defense.	2.2071632610949883
Stress fractures are one of the most common overuse injuries seen in athletes, accounting for up to 20 % of all injuries presented to sports medicine clinics.	2.2792904136493033
Runners are particularly prone to these injuries, however, it is difficult to predict injury as there is usually a critical interplay between the athlete's biomechanical predisposition, training methods, and other factors such as diet, and muscle strength and flexibility.	2.2505736040236686
This article will discuss the key clinical findings for the majority of stress fractures encountered in a sports medicine practice.	2.1826909048011593
A classification scheme will also be described that will allow the clinician to make appropriate treatment decisions based on the degree of risk for each injury.	2.289106707736956
Today, enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice, partially due to the belief that intestinal resorption of macromolecules is impossible.	2.0723635205143784
However, there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity, and placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy.	2.075915121400389
The documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma, resulting in pain reduction and better mobility.	2.207058361103112
There are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery, traumatology, plastic surgery, and dental surgery.	2.037624301261482
A further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes.	2.420602510344422
In gynaecological treatments, enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries.	2.349932524308478
Breast engorgement is a further indication for enzyme therapy.	2.3086126937532203
Further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits.	2.059006901865923
High-frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent - among others - two treatment options in hypoxemic respiratory failure of neonates.	1.9298705388592972
We report the case of a term infant with meconium aspiration syndrome, who only responded favorably to inhaled nitric oxide following the initiation of high-frequency ventilation.	2.0436803239649484
At an oxygenation index of 17 we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right-to-left shunting and improve oxygenation.	2.237928408493228
How- ever the respiratory situation did not improve, the oxygenation index increased to 25.	2.1196059557618288
After discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to HFV with mean airway pressures of 15 mbar.	2.0232117661213707
Again oxyena-tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile 31.	2.0355476506229255
At that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of 10 ppm while continuing high-frequency ventilation.	2.068800615289633
Immediately oxygenation improved significantly, the oxygenation index decreased to 9 within several minutes after restarting nitric oxide.	1.994583523273125
This effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high-frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from iNO could be performed.	2.187046307954282
Learning microsurgery of the middle ear requires preparations of temporal bones.	2.4245846668347495
Ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult.	1.9124469952431271
Due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities, the manufacture of facsimiles up to now has been impossible.	2.108700616157398
Rapid prototyping techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one.	2.074875483604566
By using CT scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3D pictures on a CAD workstation.	1.9606410482888534
We are now able to incorporate data in a stereolithographic system to create an anatomic facsimile of the temporal bone.	2.0115637638074846
It is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object.	2.495885457975868
With this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching, training and research.	2.1117623555108067
Our artificial preparations of temporal bones correspond to both the material characteristics and anatomic details of human structures, allowing various surgical exercises to be carried out.	1.9555778770081256
During the past few years the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the most frequent of the rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases has improved a great deal.	2.811992027402178
The treatment strategy is based on the one hand on the so-called prognostic factors and on the other hand on the extent of the inflammatory activities, especially during the first phase.	2.9428451019621042
Numerous controlled studies and meta-analyses have enabled optimal application of the basic disease-modifying drugs, with regard to efficacy and side effects.	2.3950960092625615
During the first stage of these disease, the immunobiological substances against pro-inflammatory cells are employed.	2.0742686593857917
Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) occurring during mechanical ventilation depends on expiratory time constants, expiratory volume and expiration time as well as on external flow resistance (tubes, valves, etc.).	1.9014105346506243
It is not routinely determined in mechanically ventilated patients, but it is necessary to optimize respirator settings.	2.562825391431726
The aim of the present study was the validation of an automated PEEPi determination method implemented in the respirator EVITA (Drägerwerke, Lübeck) in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung failure.	1.9857800008763147
The method was validated in ten sedated, myorelaxed patients with respiratory insufficiency of different etiologies (five with restrictive, and five with obstructive pulmonary disease).	1.920365105233279
PEEPi was determined using the volume constant ventilatory mode at ZEEP or at an external PEEP of 5 as well as 10 cm H2O.	2.2573061303468687
PEEPi was first determined with the automated method implemented in the EVITA (five measurements at each end-expiratory pressure level; PEEPEvita).	1.9555739283525537
These values were compared to the results obtained with end-expiratory occlusion (external, computer-controlled valve in the inspiratory limb of the circuit) at the respective pressure levels (PEEPEEO).	2.194408277352311
The average of five measurements at each PEEP level with each method was defined as PEEPi for the particular ventilatory situation.	1.9954319052164486
Gas flow was measured at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube with a heated pneumotachometer (Fleisch no.	2.1849846618484112
2, Fleisch, Lausanne, Switzerland) and a differential pressure transducer.	2.496150844259073
Tracheal pressure was determined in the same position with a further differential pressure transducer (Dr. Fenyves & Gut, Basel, Switzerland).	2.122817883568584
After A/D conversion, data were sampled with a frequency of 20 Hz and processed on an IBM compatible PC.	1.931171574293299
Software for data collection and processing as well as for control of the occlusion valve was self-programmed.	2.6031194427153217
For the statistical analysis we used the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test; a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.	1.8480786820094923
At the given respiratory setting and without PEEP patients with obstructive lung disease had a higher PEEPi (median: 6.4 cm H2O; range: 5.0 - 9.6 cm H2O) than those with restrictive pulmonary disease (median: 2.3 cm H2O; range: 0.8 - 3.0 cm H2O) (P<0.05).	1.8325149679176242
Increasing external PEEP to 5 or 10 cm H2O significantly decreased the pressure difference between PEEPi and external PEEP (P<0.05), but was unable to eliminate it completely.	2.1335373772493025
There was no statistically significant difference between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita (P=0.43; Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests).	1.9841624332106018
Regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita values (r=0.985, P<0.001; y=1.03x-0.18).	1.9843501412696058
PEEPi occurs during ventilation in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease.	2.7610033018101316
The difference between external end-expiratory pressure and PEEPi decreases with increasing external PEEP.	2.0995492376193963
However, PEEPi may increase with increasing external PEEP in some instances.	2.1297097163917993
The reason for this may be that the PEEPi determined at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube represents only a mean value of different PEEPi values of various lung regions.	2.0052070082713525
Increasing external PEEP only partially alters this mean value due to an effect on PEEPi values lower than external PEEP.	2.096894519275674
The PEEPi values measured by the EVITA respirator compared with classical end-expiratory occlusion with an external valve were nearly identical.	2.053776346424339
Unfortunately, PEEPi measurement of the EVITA can only	2.751523714730654
We report on the case of a 70-year-old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a lipodermoid of the left eye.	2.274843046232274
This rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient.	2.621272971423422
The naevus spread on the left side from parietal to retroauricular, nuchal and sternal.	2.065073230294323
Because of the patient's cardio-pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia.	2.092911348728619
We also made a partial stripped excision of the left-sided parietal parts of the naevus.	2.8011746412253675
Ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has recently been shown, in a dose of 8 mg, to be superior to 1.25 mg droperidol in preventing postoperative vomiting.	2.205489919783772
There are indications that a dose of 4 mg of ondansetron may be just as effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting as a dose of 8 mg [16].	2.0235490357915853
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the adverse effects of 4 mg ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to droperidol in patients undergoing surgery with inhalation anaesthesia supplemented with alfentanil.	1.9235500269550143
Following institutional approval, 40 ASA physical status I and II women scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery gave informed consent to participate in this randomized, double-blind comparative study.	1.989142481639181
Five minutes before induction of general anaesthesia, 20 patients received a single intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg of ondansetron and the remaining 20 received 1.25 mg droperidol IV.	2.131166869557269
Anaesthesia was induced with 2.1 - 4 mg/kg of thiopental and 0.1 mg of alfentanil IV and maintained with 65% nitrous oxide and 1.5% - 3% enflurane in oxygen.	2.072273421980091
On pain stimuli another 0.2 - 0.4 mg of alfentanil was given.	2.1151193342110166
Total effective antiemetic response was defined as the absence of nausea and vomiting for 24 h postoperatively.	2.6871182717115847
The incidence of nausea, vomiting and the number of patients showing total antiemetic response as well as the incidence of adverse effects were compared with the chi2 test and P<0.05 was considered significant.	2.49190225263305
Patients were similar with respect to age, height, body weight and total anaesthetic agents received.	2.2710816148462243
Duration of anaesthesia and the time until awakening was not significantly different among groups.	2.601574092847132
Postoperatively 7 out of 20 patients given 4 mg of ondansetron and 3 out of 20 patients with droperidol vomited (n.s.).	2.057602850982385
The incidence of nausea was 11 out of 20 in the ondansetron group, and 4 out of 20 in the droperidol group (P<0.05).	2.24288347622912
Sixteen patients in the droperidol group and 8 patients in the ondansetron group showed a total effective antiemetic response (P<0.05).	2.4980611362493192
Postoperative sedation and well-being scores did not differ significantly among groups.	2.5927696935090516
Our results show that for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting 4 mg of ondansetron was inferior to 1.25 mg of droperidol.	2.1591079837906526
The drugs were given intravenously prior to general anaesthesia for minor gynaecological surgery with nitrous oxide and enflurane in oxygen supplemented with small boluses of alfentanil.	1.8980404705713723
A 66-year-old woman died of internal bleeding and pulmonary fat embolism following repeated massive blows from a wickerwork carpetbeater and an electric cable.	1.9836748409080174
The initial autopsy diagnosis was natural death.	2.2799106472968744
A second autospy on the exhumed body and an intensive criminal investigation revealed a long history of maltreatment by two sisters with whom the victim lived.	1.7868809977498001
The maltreatment occurred during exorcisms with the purported purpose of ridding the victim of her possession by Satan.	1.879639129664524
The perpetrators and the victim belonged to the same pseudoreligous sect.	2.1660105155883596
The elder of the two sisters had been previously convicted of a fatal exorcism maltreatment of a 17-year-old girl.	2.2727689476385167
Definition of the problem: The article discusses the ways in which sociological analyses can contribute to the problem of a just allocation of scarce donor organs.	1.9990005284231158
Since 1993, 30 patients with acute distal intraarticular radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	2.150415701742023
According to the AO classification there were 3 B- and 27 C-fractures, most of them Frykman VIII fractures.	2.164846860911903
Of 30 fractures 23 showed additional lesions which could only be diagnosed under arthroscopic view.	2.3104968991245185
Of 25 fractures 23 which were treated at least 12 months previously could be followed up radiologically and clinically.	2.229869489938904
X-rays included postero anterior and lateral views to evaluate the radial angles and the radial length and stress tests to check for instability, especially of the scapholunate ligaments.	2.160835053894165
Clinical examination included range of motion and objective grip strength measured with a Jamar (Cedaron) tester.	1.9553984006037495
Each test was performed on both wrists for comparison.	2.5949531542718365
Subjective data included pain and function for daily activities.	2.2488639511090516
About 70% of our patients showed an excellent or good result; about 15% had a poor result.	2.3286598049112874
However, we must mention that we were not able to reduce one C3-fracture under arthroscopic view and had to switch to a semi-open procedure with additional external fixateurs.	1.9674256535593606
Arthroscopically assisted treatment of distal intraarticular fractures is not only useful to detect and manage additional carpal lesions, but seems to give good midterm results as well.	2.003196517868805
Antitachycardia pacing techniques (ATP) have proved useful for termination of ventricular tachycardia (VT).	2.01230131930294
However, little is known about the efficacy and safety off ATP during long-term follow-up in a larger study population.	2.4263029504246636
We analyzed the data of 80 ICD patients (pts) with spontaneous monormorphic VT, mean age 59  +/-  12 years, the mean follow-up was 26  +/-  17 months.	2.3226298783633728
2926 episodes of ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 349  +/-  51 ms, 240-520 ms) occurred in 64/80 pts (80%), overall efficacy of ATP was 89.9%, acceleration occurred in 4.1% of VTs.	1.776609312422335
Success of ATP did not correlate with positive ATP testing on induced arrhythmias, LVEF, NYHA class or aneurysm.	1.9021443142099668
Neither underlying heart disease nor antiarrhythmic medication had an impact on the ATP success rate.	2.2083977388782285
ATP efficacy was linked significantly to short VT cycle length (VTCL, 240-300 ms, p < 0.01) and long coupling intervals (91-97%), p < 0.01).	1.9511626040757781
Acceleration occurred in 32% of pts and in 4.1% of VT episodes; it was also dependent on short VT cycle length (< 300 ms vs > 300 ms, p < 0.04) and short coupling intervals (< 81% vs >= 81%, p <= 0.01).	1.8301774516311973
Methodological work was performed in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in order to develop suitable tools for non-invasive characterization of hematopoetic bone marrow.	2.68564185311556
The methods were applied for the assessment of normal values in healthy persons and to examine patients with generalized hematological diseases or to monitor effects of therapies influencing the composition of bone marrow.	2.1897989426859414
Lichen ruber planus is considered a T-cell mediated immunologic reaction with unclear pathogenesis.	2.3107140590923945
Drugs and infections (especially hepatitis B and C) are well-known provocation factors.	2.396265110810856
After an infection with scabies a 13 year old boy developed a generalized lichen planus including bullous lesions.	2.08009874310663
For the first time scabies is presented as a trigger for lichen planus.	2.216714571309484
In childhood, lichen planus is characterized by atypical clinical features and sometimes a severe course.	2.415079645872638
Introduction: Increasing demands on quality assurance und medical performance documentation require an immedate and evaluable documentation in the outpatients' department.	1.8821064648048038
Presentation of a new computer-based diagnostic system for reporting and medical performance documentation.	2.3758506802647026
Methods: Development and initial application of the system in three big orthopeadical or traumatological hospitals.	2.3183421667728785
Judegements about the feasibility of immediate documentation in outpatients' departments.	2.3011665606809446
Results: Presentation of an outpatients' departments diagnostic system with textblock-oriented anamnesis or anatomy-related diagnosis through pre-structured examination checklists.	1.8053514124445087
Coding of ICD-9/-10 as well as AO-classification and AIS (abbreviated injury scale).	2.5587407508872015
Medical performance documentation through forms including pre-defined billing codes.	2.1228978725555696
Presentation of the documentation flow and its transfer into other contexts.	2.1662865262594155
Discussion: Pure text-based clinical results do not allow sufficient evalutation for quality assurance and medical performance documentation.	2.013079858438065
However, a computer-based and immediate documentation in outpatients' departments should not mean a significantly increased workload for physicians.	1.9560390949292987
Hydromorphone is a µ receptor agonist opioid.	2.306514351396413
According to WHO recommendations, hydromorphone is to be classified in step III of pain therapy.	2.219561225027326
An oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of 12 hours has been evaluated only recently.	2.2191002395555754
The controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain.	2.2911965962086267
The oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step III.	2.3383754403980053
Hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief (despite increase of doses) or causes intolerable side effects (despite treatment of symptoms).	1.9112158690552647
In principle, no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected.	2.384183573809437
However, clinical experience shows that changing one opioid analgesic to another one can improve the treatment of patients so that hydromorphone may replace another opioid analgesic to which a patient fails to respond well or develops side effects.	2.0064479615366744
The dose of hydromorphone equivalent to 2 times 30 mg controlled release morphine is about 2 times 4 mg.	1.921133240524691
The values for the absorption, bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours -of three times the dose- are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every 4 hours.	1.977213127827547
In several open label and controlled studies, hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain, especially in patients with severe cancer pain.	2.881385951020951
With regard to the incidence of side effects, no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established.	2.947541764554018
In general, the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics.	2.449829035730266
In 63 patients, 82 elevations of the maxillary sinus were performed.	2.1672517479903335
As augmentation, materials autografts from the iliac crest (combined with alveolar ridge augmentations in 16 sinus lifts) were transplanted in 39 cases and osteoinductive, allogeneic bone powder (AAA bone (autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone): n = 8, DFDBA (demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft) and/or GraftonTM (demineralized bone matrix gel): n = 35) were used in 43 cases.	1.746263739603805
Some 4-6 months after implantation, osteoinductive, allogeneic (demineralized) bone implants showed radio-opaque areas as an equivalent of bone formation.	2.158598800577179
Histological examinations revealed that osteoinductive implants were completely transformed into patients' own bone tissue.	2.0387313499440767
The average augmentation height after autograft transplantations was 14 ( +/-  3) mm in comparison with 9 ( +/-  3) mm after allograft implantations.	2.097370171952356
Histologically as well as radiologically no differences of the bone quality could be determined between the two augmentation materials.	3.0026450260271393
Endoscopic controls showed, in both groups, nonirritated mucous membranes.	2.5650057698751065
On an average 2 endosseous implants (Bone LockR or ITIR-screw implants) were inserted into the augmentated maxillary sinus floors in both groups.	1.8355092796482788
No osseointegration was achieved in 4 out of 67 dental implants when bone autografts were used and in 2 out of 74 dental implants of the allogeneic bone group.	2.0880628371526564
Patients with bone autografts suffered from postoperative complaints on an average of 19 ( +/-  9) days (without consideration of 2 patients with postoperative complaints persisting for more than 90 days).	2.318060080836372
The average postoperative complaints of recipients of allogeneic bone implants continued for 3 ( +/-  5) days.	2.317749669866972
Under critical consideration of all investigated parameters, osteoinductive bone implants are preferable to iliac bone autografts for maxillary sinus augmentations in those cases in which no additional alveolar ridge augmentation is required.	1.8617832649586321
We describe a patient with a primary renal plasmacytoma.	2.680552925610779
In the literature available, only six clinical cases have been reported.	2.1692777180981806
A 64-year-old patient is presented who had the clinical signs of a renal cell carcinoma.	3.1165764495150223
Histological examination after nephrectomy, however, revealed a plasmacytoma.	2.7132592736345242
Based on this case, we discuss how one should proceed in this disease.	2.266071257088326
Primary renal plasmacytoma can be tentatively diagnosed preoperatively only in the presence of paraproteinemia or Bence-Jones proteinuria, as it cannot be distinguished from other renal tumors by imaging procedures.	2.133541302158959
Postoperatively, further staging procedures must rule out bone involvement (solitary myeloma or multiple myeloma).	1.874233684661786
Nephrectomy is required in patients with plasmacytoma only if renal complications occur.	2.7020249446661406
Dissection of the ascending aorta (type A) following later after aortic valve replacement has been described with increasing frequency.	2.3818137518558093
This study analyzes the role of aortic valve replacement for the evolution of late dissection.	2.5533329358378283
Between December 1986 and November 1995, 222 patients with 225 acetabular fractures were treated operatively by three surgeons in the Department of Traumatology and Emergency Surgery of the University Hospitals of the Catholic University of Leuven.	1.971884216820605
Indications for surgery were unstable fracture, displaced fracture through the acetabular dome and fracture with intra-acetabular fracture fragments.	1.8814851589360686
There were 37.3% A-fractures, 49.7% B-fractures, and 13% C fractures according to the AO Classification.	2.2815460584133653
In 16.4% of fractures there were primary neurological deficits.	2.219324176636306
Patients were treated operatively after an average of 5.0 days.	2.6350278891043786
The Kocher-Langenbeck approach was used in 56.9% of cases, the ilio-inguinal approach in 27.1% and the extended iliofemoral approach in 4%.	2.161553888047087
In 7.1% of patients, a primary total hip endoprosthesis was implanted.	2.3730302668699292
There was no intra- oder perioperative mortality.	2.1589082055985993
The average hospital stay was 26.1 days.	2.3697525006789357
In 7.1% of patients, we noted secondary neurological problems.	2.418571275382362
Deep infections were present in 1.3%.	2.775182936824721
In 11.1% of patients a second operative procedure was necessary.	2.3670019265231574
We were able to review 175 patients after an average of 2 years.	2.500525795174716
Signs of arthrosis and periarticular ossification were noted on the x-rays: walking distance, hip mobility and pain intensity were asked about and recorded after the clinical examination.	2.0227829634483108
In 76% of patients an excellent or good result on the Merle-d'Aubigne scale was obtained.	2.0862004473311955
T-fractures and posterior wall fractures were followed by the worst results.	2.4742009401397786
During this 9-year period, changes have been made to the preoperative radiological examination carried out, the choice of operative approach and our policy on prevention of thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative ossification.	2.1985268431838096
After thorough preoperative diagnosis and with a meticulous operative technique, it is possible to stabilise the vast majority of acetabular fractures through the three classical approaches.	2.29737131364576
Because the fractures are relatively rare, their diagnosis complex and their surgical treatment difficult, specific training is essential for every acetabular surgeon.	2.0362590039092865
Diagnostic pitfalls exist when benign salivary gland diseases are mistakenly classified as malignant, with consequences for treatment and prognosis.	1.9804741818264586
Examples are necrotizing sialometaplasia, metaplastic Warthin tumour and sclerosing polycystic sialadenopathy.	1.923344525937948
The proper diagnosis is of eminent importance to distinguish cases of primary tumours that have developed in salivary glands or their lymph nodes from cases of extraglandular tumours with metastases in these glands or their nodes.	1.8943751329990863
In these cases clinical data and additional immunocytochemical methods are necessary to clarify the exact diagnosis, especially when the primary salivary gland tumours have a structure largely identical to the metastases (e.g.	2.0377283100892143
Nasopharyngeal or cervical chordomas can be mistaken for pleomorphic adenoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma.	2.0499044384473657
The initial stage of malignant MALT lymphomas in association with Sjögren's syndrome demands identification of clonal rearrangement for therapeutic implication.	1.937440892686821
The diagnostic criteria for proper classification are analysed in detail.	2.200157358647478
A 59-year-old male patient was transnasally operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with hypopituitarism.	2.39206240419566
A second operation and X-ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor.	2.1834829258445194
Both neoplasmas were classified as sparsely granulated prolactin cell adenomas.	2.288058877859116
Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and FSH in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor.	2.179443900643494
Two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated.	2.2392932289771745
A tumor in the liver was identified.	3.041809387282554
Biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology.	2.1171336473097866
Due to structural and immunohistological similarities this tumor could be identified as a metastasis of the pituitary tumor.	2.2534607643375386
After 5 months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism.	2.5755847392014495
Post-mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinoma.	2.3268161059179358
Our case report confirms the experience with 35 definite pituitary carcinomas reparted in the current literature: malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor, but only from its metastases.	1.9977123824976024
Paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease.	2.2840535654550878
While some disorders almost invariably herald an underlying malignancy (obligative marker), most only occasionally do so (facultative marker).	1.7700835224881282
The association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial.	2.2494520304524976
There are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma.	2.7065707234781384
We diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a 74 year old female patient, admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid.	2.4559707528693084
Multiple metastases were found in her lymph nodes, liver, lung and skeleton.	2.6675805633952216
The patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared.	2.4933143907922424
Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature.	2.185865298213419
Closed femoral fractures and blunt soft tissue trauma are the main causes of this injury.	2.468231049272644
The multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur.	2.34585542995065
Fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of extense swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient.	2.209530248387605
Sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury.	2.493179800480942
During the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated.	2.206530538284408
Therefore an operative revision of the sciatic nerve was performed eighteen weeks after trauma.	2.152185498115817
No direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome.	2.2360924395891697
The tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy.	2.2980403865665733
Conclusion: Early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain, paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient.	2.0220363017330643
Tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign.	2.5164932306677534
Frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients.	2.49430243352039
We suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far outweighed by the morbidity that accompanies an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy.	1.7707599521707704
Aim: The long-term effect of DNase with cystic fibrosis was examined.	2.420542763894865
Teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers.	2.855587214105453
The police publish difficult cases of unidentified bodies in dental print media.	1.9702372606090388
Using their records such as x-rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification.	2.061644692616889
To evaluate the efficency of this procedure 177 cases published between 1975 and 1995 were examined.	2.073403996217188
Only 3% of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media.	2.4281631510340937
According to these results a new concept of presentation sould be developed to improve the efficency of this odontoforensic method.	2.1206192817353684
New technological possibilities such as digital x-raying or online data transfer could open new ways for forensic identification.	1.780244047927696
In a fatality after oral intake of a large amount of an insecticide spray consisting of propoxur, tetramethrine and the solvents isopropanol and benzyl alcohol, a coagulation nectrotic fixation of the oesophagus and stomach were the main morphological findings.	1.8427803878454228
The concentrations determined by HPLC and GC/MS in femoral blood, liver, kidney, vitreous humor and liquor were in the comatose lethal range for propoxur (< 0.3-18 µg/g), whereas tetrametrin (up to 0.1 µg/g) was almost completely decomposed.	1.8829349831371582
The propoxur decomposition product o-isopropoxyphenol (2.8-56 µg/g), benzyl alcohol (18-58 µg/g) and its oxydation product benzoic acid (85-140 µg/g), isopropanol (0.45-1.1 mg/g) and acetone (0.01-0.03 mg/g) were also found.	1.899884696414068
On the other hand, the concentrations in heart blood and lung tissue were up to 30 times higher.	1.9711500495768395
As a reason for these immense concentration differences an agonale aspiration of the highly concentrated liquid stomach content after vomiting immediately before death is discussed.	1.7738331269852656
The extent of the metabolization of propoxur to o-isopropoxyphenol and of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid, which is assumed to proceed mainly postmortem, was quite different in the materials investigated and was almost complete in the liver.	1.9843674169093293
The intoxication by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor propoxur in combination with the neurotoxic effect of tetramethrine was determined as the cause of death.	2.1874034387913057
Background: Despite the fact that deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLKP) is less invasive than to penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), this procedure is rarely performed.	2.0795357000700796
We therefore investigated whether or not the DLKP technique we employed can achieve stable improvement of visual acuity.	2.025805056321579
Palmoplantar keratodermia (PPK) varians and PPK punctata are considered different entities within the group of hereditary palmoplantar keratodermas.	1.98574811499764
Keratosis punctata of the palmar creases constitutes a localized form of keratodermia palmoplantaris punctata.	2.0212421887585537
We describe a 31-year-old man exhibiting both nummular and papular keratoses on the soles, as well as small punctate keratoses confined to the palmar creases.	2.123872013626111
In view of the co-occurrence of these two types of PPK, the question arises whether keratosis palmoplantaris of the varians and the punctate type represent distinct entities or represent variable manifestations of the same gene defect.	1.9730698307008672
The author gives a synoptic view on the paths and routes of emigration the jewish and/or political reasons persecuted psychoanalysts had to take in order to escape national socialist Germany.	1.984885369137181
With reference to current studies on emigration, which for Germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between 1933 and 1938, the immigration policy especially of the United States and Great Britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed.	1.829980674888719
In this context, the major importance of the solidarity and help the refugees were granted by the international psychoanalytic community and performed in spite of partially major theoretical differences and institutional rivalries is emphasized.	1.8658321658017305
Acute suppurative thyroiditis is very rare in childhood.	2.483092783918371
We describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children, and add 2 own cases of this rare disease.	2.306641369058366
In the first case, diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid.	2.155543811908895
Operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then.	2.5846633862427324
In the second case, a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only.	2.081589852248659
Seven years later, no recurrent abscess occurred in this child.	2.3383112880534207
In conclusion, especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection.	2.1625840134369936
If present, complete removal of the fistula is essential for permanent cure.	2.730951896330367
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	1.7428509754535457
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	2.0977766825633286
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n=98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	2.0440809775777096
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	2.0376958442855218
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	2.0659151638241124
Simpson in Scotland was the first to describe the administration of ether for analgesia in painful deliveries.	2.3746630300067415
Only a few days later E.C.J.	2.4666574249253737
von Siebold (*1801 in Würzburg - \dagger1861 in Göttingen) performed the first systematic study on ether in obstetrics.	1.79596574945485
Following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non-pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour, he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients.	1.9549858743089665
The first administration was on February 25th 1847.	2.1471631856785676
While he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new-born, he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients.	1.959588172044975
He concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery, since it disturbed the natural course of labour.	2.002039752731485
On the other hand, von Siebold was very pleased with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention.	1.8674671043981566
Background: Mode switching aims to maintain a ventricular rhythm that matches metabolic needs during both sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias.	1.963136227953548
This allows patients with atrial arrhythmias to benefit from AV synchronous pacing modes.Aim and method: Beat-to-beat mode switching in Diamond and Clarity pacemakers is designed to maintain a relatively stable ventricular rhythm, ensuring consistent ventricular filling patterns.	1.8206600116544038
Atrial tachyarrhythmia detection is based on a continuous analysis of the atrial rhythm.	3.1667824664328026
A too rapid increase of the atrial rate with a beat-to-beat acceleration > 15 bpm is considered to be an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	2.445700925310753
Mode switching occurs on detection of the first premature atrial event: atrial tracking is stopped and the ventricular rate is determined by the rate indicated by the dual sensor (QT interval and activity).	2.101588268631254
Atrial pacing restores AV synchrony immediately after cessation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia, effectively avoiding retrograde conduction.	2.0335551364392357
Dedicated diagnostic functions allow one to monitor the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to study atrial and ventricular events just prior to its onset.	2.3817441208213213
Both the mode switching and rate responsive function are fully automatic, rendering follow-up procedures easy and less time-consuming.	2.0985398002557347
Conclusion: Reliable detection of all atrial events is essential to guarantee appropriate mode switching.	2.189378102426938
Therefore, the pacemaker stores the distribution of the amplitude of all atrial events, both during sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias, which facilitates the appropriate programming of the atrial sensitivity.	2.0494253008865764
Introduction: Mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by CT and MRI.	2.56940094236218
The applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air- and bone-containing thorax, which permits only restricted echo windows.	2.032502566078325
Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography circumvents this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum.	2.254856053391897
Blood glucose alterations prior to cerebral ischaemia are associated with poor neurologic outcome, possibly due to extensive lactic acidosis or energy failure.	2.0020464485679006
Cerebral effects of hyper- or hypoglycaemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are less well known.	2.07025960007078
In addition, little information is available concerning cardiac effects of blood glucose alterations.	2.1208700332873742
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre-cardiac-arrest hypo- or hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia upon haemodynamics, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism (CMRO2), and regional cardiac blood flow during CPR subsequent to 3 min of cardiac and respiratory arrest and after restoration of spontaneous circulation.	1.9007463060209964
After approval by the State Animal Investigation Committee, 29 mechanically ventilated, anaesthetised pigs were instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and blood flow determination by the radiolabeled microsphere technique.	1.7486131437024415
After 3 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and respiratory arrest, CPR (chest compressor/ventilator (Thumper) and epinephrine infusion) was commenced and continued for 8 min.	1.8366283312403746
Thereafter, defibrillation was attempted, and if successful, the animals were observed for another 240 min.	2.0934603155032865
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), CBF, CMRO2, coronary perfusion pressure (CorPP), and regional cardiac blood flow were determined at control, after 3 min of CPR, and at 10, 30, and 240 min post-CPR.	2.0897047745456727
In group I, 4/9 animals (44%) could be successfully resuscitated; in group II 4/10 (40%); and in group III 0/10 (0%).	2.376511590999296
Prior to cardiac arrest, mean arterial pressure, CPP, and CorPP in group III were significantly lower compared to groups I and II.	2.199124005614588
In group I, CPP during CPR was 26 +/- 6 mmHg; CBF 31 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g CMRO2 3.8 +/- 1.2 ml/min/100 g; CorPP 18 +/- 5 mmHg; and left ventricular (LV) flow 35 +/- 15 ml/min/100 g. In group II: CPP=21 +/- 5; CBF 21 +/- 7; CMRO2 1.8 +/- 0.8; CorPP 16 +/- 6; and LV flow 22 +/- 9; and in group III: CPP 15 +/- 3; CBF 11 +/- 8; CMRO2 1.5 +/- 1.1; CorPP 4 +/- 2; and LV flow 19 +/- 10.	2.078017645585341
During the 240-min post-resuscitation period, there were no differences in CBF, CMRO2, or LV flow between groups I and II.	2.0467478976037836
Hypoglycaemia prior to cardiac arrest appears to be predictive for a poor cardiac outcome, whereas hyperglycaemia does not impair resuscitability compared to normoglycaemia.	2.1453332479483156
In addition, hyperglycaemia did not affect LV flow, CBF, or CMRO2.	1.9922720679538803
However, it has to be kept in mind that haemodynamics and organ blood flow do not permit conclusions with respect to functional neurologic recovery or histopathologic damage to the brain, which is very likely to be associated with hyperglycaemia.	2.4777678275720874
Normal urinary organic acids in patients with non-specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely, and no further investigations are required.	2.500802272959763
In other patients, the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical, neuroradiological and biochemical findings.	2.6008855834174396
GCDH enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom GA1 is very likely.	2.31325227997229
This article gives a brief review of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the nineteenth century up to our own time.	2.3520161323573436
Malignant lymphomas, originating from peripheral T or NK cells, are rare tumours in Europe and account for less than 10% of all malignant lymphomas.	2.1384403988051437
In this review, the salient features of the more frequently occurring entities derived from T or NK cells will be presented.	2.003632564904196
Nasal NK/T cell lymphoma is mainly found in the nose and paranasal sinuses and often, but not always, display an angiocentric growth pattern leading to coagulation necrosis.	2.08855726773886
The tumor cells consistently express CD56, CD2 and the EBER molecules encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus.	1.8400496243544184
Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis.	2.5661863017089788
The tumour cells express T cell antigens, CD103 and cytotoxic molecules, but are negative for CD4.	1.984930007285289
Approximately 20% of the cases display CD56 mostly in combination with CD8.	3.0606065318671973
Recently, an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified.	2.287797951615527
Histologically these cases resemble celiac disease, however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent CD8 and T-cell-receptor protein expression, and, they are clonal by molecular analysis.	1.9854875509908625
Clinically, the patients suffer from refractory sprue or ulcerative jejunitis.	2.2018769002725005
The prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour-forming T-cell lymphoma.	2.092433750051366
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings (atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale cytoplasm, arborizing high endothelial venules and large FDC-meshworks) as well as clinical features (systemic symptoms, signs of a dysregulated immune response).	2.0006484645976
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas, that do not fit into a distinct entity, are classified in the REAL and the new WHO classifications as peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified.	2.170055090708307
These display a broad morphological spectrum (including the T-cell lymphomas of different cell sizes, Lennert's lymphoma and T-zone lymphoma of the Kiel-classification) and in general are clinically aggressive.	2.069020625087777
Causes and courses of the diseases are subjected to a change of an increasing life expectancy on the one hand and technically highly developed medicine on the other hand.	2.1714654274846446
Since a growing number of elderly people is denying intensive medical interventions which serve the purpose of keeping them alive despite severe diseases, the problem of euthanasia imposes direct questions.	1.987959494748413
A central role is played by the active-passive difference and its moralistic legitimacy.	1.9806997387070597
The difficulties of this difference are discussed below on the applicable level of ethical discussions.	2.001059874642566
At the same time, knowledge of the danger is being made aware that in a maximal therapeutical orientated medical care system the desire for euthanasia may become identical with the reverse side of this care system.	1.9840973743872405
Isolated severe head trauma (SHT) or SHT in combination with multiple injuries are important factors for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the consequences of accidents.	2.574555505548754
The prognosis mainly depends on the presence of primary mechanic brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage.	2.676701763341183
Causes for the development of secondary brain damage are the intracranial space demand after traumatic injury and edema formation which may result in iscemia, as well as inflammatory processes.	2.3775980516703443
Both isolated SHT and polytrauma with or without brain damage may result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which may cause a single or multiple organ failure (MOF).	2.2359282808416263
Often the organism is able to survive isolated traumatic injuries and functional disturbances, but in combination or cumulation they may be lethal.	2.2096876101955747
The hypermetabolism after SHT is often regarded as an interaction between the central nervous system and the whole organism by the activation of the neuroendocrine axis.	2.47325554048589
In contrast to the consequences of SHT for the whole organism, multiple injuries after polytrauma may affect brain functions, such as the shock dependent disturbance of the brain perfusion accompanied by brain hypoxia which may lead to an aggravated prognosis.	2.11478970159441
Moreover, coagulation, metabolism and fracture healing are influenced by the onset of SIRS as well.	2.388085348644887
Our knowledge about the bidirectional inflammatory interaction between brain and whole organism is still limited.	2.2157666527690574
In this context, the effects of secondary surgical interventions which may additionally stress a traumatized body have to be considered and are the subject for actual clinical discussions and experimental studies.	2.1138943179063037
This article tries to summarize some important aspects on this topic.	2.08138713198312
Background: Chronic cough and thoracic pain, commonly caused by upper airway infections, are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics.	2.037189904837016
These "benign" symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders.	2.186044603439607
Methods: In two patients (male, age 41/12 and 43/12 years) chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm (Pleuropulmonary blastoma).	2.0148148778536705
Results: Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis.	2.3364582267561724
An incomplete resection was performed in both cases.	3.096121997647968
Both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy.	2.3464868274473956
One boy died, the other one is alive and well more than 6 years after diagnosis without evidence of disease.	2.3568941806570844
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy) can provide a long term remission.	1.9733602096846277
In 12 patients with systemic sclerosis the influence of hypnosis and autogenic training on the acral blood circulation and the coping with the disease was investigated in a pilot study.	2.261989015087908
In the first step significant increases in the skin temperature of the fingers (mean +/- SD: 3.9 +/- 1.2  °C) could be found after relaxation hypnosis.	2.3003270926118287
In the second step six patients (study group) gained experience with autogenic training.	2.0362508681383047
The other six patients served as control group.	2.1884735218808724
Long-term effects of the autogenic training (mean acral rewarning time, duration and course of the Raynaud attacks, acral lesions of the hands, psychosomatic status of complaints, type of relation to the disease as precondition for coping with the disease) were not found within the relatively short follow-up period of 4 months.	2.319209739858521
Two patients, however, reported that they could shorten the duration of Raynaud attacks by autogenic training.	2.4074243136174753
In our patients heterogenicity and an increased score of multiple psychosomatic complaints were registered at the outset.	2.06937345420897
As far as the type of relation to the disease is concerned, the patients could be assessed as almost adapted.	2.628867875866593
Hypnosis and autogenic training can be recommended as complementary therapy in systemic sclerosis.	2.3504708384424013
Abstract The term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea, cough, and count or purulence of sputum.	1.938533563645316
The management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management, hospital management or intensive care treatment.	2.0064811465668244
Cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors.	2.6939669746766897
The first-line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug-treatment with 2-agonists and anticholinergics.	2.197166225081221
Systemic steroids as a short-term course are advocated if hospital-treatment is necessary.	2.4413919345599226
Infections of the respiratory tract are a frequent cause of acute exacerbations.	2.7836841798735925
However, a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state.	2.3427019557701434
Antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present.	2.208394216188192
The severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms.	2.451405138542517
This should be borne in mind for the choice of the antimicrobiotic treatment.	2.208491492829499
As a consequence the number of intubations and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced.	2.526382588240006
If invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary, the potential of dynamic hyperinflation in acute exacerbation has to be considered.	2.5239500875329863
Background: In 1986 Prof. H. Olbing (University of Essen Pediatrics Department), supported by Prof. G. Stickler (Mayo Medical School, Minnesota), introduced a 4-weeks clinical skills lab for all students (annual class 250), based on self-instruction by means of computer-assisted, interactive, audiovisual learning materials, models, bedside teaching and seminars on special topics (partially peer-guided).	1.7128687944761185
Each year 14 chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching.	2.0881690173023575
The peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills.	1.9930553982191017
Each tutor is active during 4-5 skills lab periods, and in each period he/she coaches two groups of two students each.	2.10658230222184
During the bedside teaching phase each group examines and presents four patients.	2.038851737838503
Spinal injuries referring to banal falls are common injuries in elderly persons.	2.216576809386871
Up to 55 years of age spinal fractures are more frequent in men while its opposite in older persons.	2.219108339026521
There are two typical lesions: odontoid fracture in the upper cervical spine and compression fracture in thoracolumbar spine.	2.0692812356629013
Odontoid fracture is the most frequent lesion in cervical spine in the elderly.	2.852986815777473
This is caused by trabecular structure of dens axis and spine's stiffness in old age.	2.063563953718178
Instable fractures in extension type II are most common.	2.4410710020485253
In many cases the instability of the lesion is hidden and can be first seen in functional examination controlled by x-ray.	2.27150451832418
Conservative treatment is efficient in stable lesions type III while there is a high risk for pseudarthrosis in treatment of instable lesions in elderly with Halo Fixateur e. g. We think that the best operation for these fractures is the anterior screw fixation.	2.081632879557402
If this is not sufficient because of low bone mass or early dislocation of the screws a dorsal fusion C1/C2 with transarticular screwing e. g. should be done.	2.176510083394533
Because of rare symptoms thoracolumbar fractures in osteoporosis are hidden frequently.	2.0810906830277536
In many cases it's not easy to distinguish acute lesions from healed fractures or tumor lesions.	1.9016505349553816
Therefore there are just few compression fractures (A type) that have to be treated operatively.	2.4475579895660555
Instable lesions type B and C must be operated as well in the elderly as in the young.	2.556509080249296
Because of low bone mass in elderly the dorsal instrumentation should include more than just the two injured segments.	1.9570773388995104
An even more adequate stabilisation is done with an additional vertebral replacement.	2.158131037859658
Following curative minimal-invasive laser resection of T1-T3 laryngeal carcinomas, patients were subjected to an intensive voice rehabilitation.	2.064474401697284
Before and after rehabilitation, acoustic analyses were made by using two different computer-supported measuring systems: (1) the "multidimensional voice program" (Kay Elementrics Corp.) and (2) a novel software program developed in Göttingen that includes a new voice quality parameter based on correlations between frequency bands.	1.8710658874608592
Findings showed that not all acoustic parameters equally documented voice improvement after rehabilitation.	2.0462359346128376
The standard deviation of fundamental frequency was the only parameter showing a significant post-therapeutic improvement.	2.085295537226789
A further suitable acoustic method proved to be the voice quality parameter that has been newly introduced by us.	2.358015347500859
In contrast to analogous parameters of other methods, this approach is independent of the exact periodicity of the glottal excitation function, thus permitting reliable results to be obtained even with aphonic or heavily dysphonic voices.	1.8296900587950113
Aseptic pseudarthrosis may occur after all kinds of traumatology treatment.	2.300307533111012
Following conservative treatment, incomplete immobilisation or an unattached bone fragment can be causal.	2.003921828604484
After plate osteosynthesis the biomechanical principles are not efficient or the circulatory damage delays healing.	2.0445429985998196
There are two broad types of pseudarthrosis: vascular and nonvascular.	2.082185295662874
The extent of vascularisation can be demonstrated by bone scintigraphy as well as X-ray.	2.7144121958712613
The treatment of vascular nonunions is very common.	2.2625138151204887
Mechanical stability is required, therefore a new osteosynthesis is desirable.	2.3335937402865334
Osteoporosis caused by inactivity and dislocation increases the rate of complications.	2.4897244042605347
Much more difficult problems are encountered in treatment of unreactive and avital pseudarthrosis, particularly in cases with a defect of bone substance.	2.3772979418569316
These defects can be treated with a segment transfer and a fibula-to-tibia operation.	2.587033984176504
Extracorporal lithotripsy has been established as a new method in treatment of active and vascular nonunions.	2.5914790402196077
Former osteosynthesis is not a contraindication.	3.0847880547605016
Stability and immobilisation are necessary.	2.6003058311697314
Treatment in the low-frequency magnetic field shows no effect.	2.3155869613495375
Correct biomechanical and biological osteosynthesis with proper attention paid to location, quality of bone and asepsis can avoid the development of a pseudarthrosis.	2.289507628049088
Aim of the study: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological abnormalities in 10 year old survivors with extremely low birthweight of 500-999 g. In addition the association between retinopathy of prematurity and other ophthalmological disorders was studied.	1.9674348795368903
Background: Although the majority of surgeons regard Hartmann's operation as therapeutic standard in perforations of the colon complicated by peritonitis this procedure has been critically discussed in recent years.	2.0678673846899227
Advocates of one-stage techniques criticized bad postoperative results (high morbidity and mortality) and long-term outcome (low rates of intestinal restoration).	2.307470351405864
The aim of our study was to investigate whether the late results after Hartmann's operation justify this criticism.	2.0099570793109205
Method: From 1982 to 1997 Hartmann's operations were performed in 103 patients for colonic perforations.	2.218122723785131
In 63 % of cases inflammatory diseases caused colonic complications.	2.2031854875778554
The average Mannheimer Peritonitis Index (MPI) was 19.	2.0923727704749973
Seventeen patients died postoperatively (mortality: 16.5 %).	2.2953225785497122
In 69 patients (80 %) intestinal restoration could be performed after an average interval of 122 days (complication rate: 6 %, no mortality).	2.1224206259134752
On follow-up, patients were asked to give information on their general state, changes of housing, abdominal complaints, and quality of life.	2.3338169813081855
Results: Data on 93 % of patients could be obtained.	2.3904024381319524
The median follow-up time was 75 months.	2.580212367731658
Eleven patients had died; the remaining 72 were investigated.	2.329318271747534
86 % described the quality of their lives as good or very good; only 11 % indicated severe loss of activity.	2.2575632732817787
Quality of life did not differ between patients in whom intestinal continuity had been restored and those in whom it had not been restored.	2.145887314338336
Conclusions: According to our results, long-term outcome after Hartmann's operation is good.	2.7043039566978466
Clinical examination and CT scan have proved to be the best ways of measuring static tibial torsion, whereas dynamic measurements are usually performed in the clinic and the "gait laboratory."	2.1730969746171622
Only few studies have determined there to be a connection between a torsion defect in the lower leg and expected pathological conditions of the knee and ankle joints.	2.4561278189596645
However, patellofemoral instability, Osgood-Schlatter disease, osteochondrosis dissecans are increasingly being found in cases of increased external tibial torsion and arthrosis in reduced torsion.	1.9680417757777446
The aim of this study was to ascertain to what extent homeless, mentally ill subjects in Munich take advantage of available psychosocial services.	1.8351274194072058
To obtain a representative picture of the situation, the first step was to ascertain how many people in Munich are actually homeless.	2.134533379624435
The next step was to ascertain what proportion of them are in need of psychotherapy.	2.277094278282147
Using the standardized Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), 146 men and 32 women were interviewed.	1.8832326067285934
The results according to the DSM-III demonstrated high lifelong and 6-month prevalence of psychic disturbances.	2.3926532997135883
Medical and social services were often enjoyed, but mostly over a short period of time in particularly critical situations.	2.0678500909043565
Women were treated more often than men.	2.4643587547033263
Elements such as age and level of education hardly influenced patients' seeking help.	2.187023966058664
Despite a high prevalence of addictive disease, alcohol and drug clinics were rarely consulted.	2.092946452940612
The increase in the number of diagnoses was paralleled by an increase in the number of patients seeking help.	2.6267496650249726
Most treatments involved schizophrenia and anxiety.	2.423425829228075
By means of logistic regression models, predictors of the extent to which these services were used were analysed.	2.0467434196317913
We conclude that new clinical models are needed and that the aversion to the present care system is too great.	2.0596361954530527
Continued treatment occurs only rarely.	2.5763787670733307
Electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics are currently used as diagnostic criteria for the long QT-syndrome.	2.41500915243598
In borderline electrocardiographic findings associated with unclear syncope, it is often difficult to ensure or exclude long QT-syndrome.	2.261631006596736
Schwartz and coworkers therefore created a point system as a guide in clinical decision making.	1.9864738208870776
In recent years genetic diagnostics have entered the arena of long-QT assessment.	2.0983513591215637
Aside from new insights into the pathophysiology of the long QT-disorder, it is expected that genetic diagnostics will offer substantial help to ascertain long QT-syndrome in patients with borderline electrocardiographic and clinical findings and improve risk stratification in long-QT family members.	2.37715791306452
Performing linkage analysis, coupling of autosomal-dominant congenital long QT-syndrome (Romano-Ward Syndrome) to chromosomes 11 (LQT1/11p15.5), 3 (LQT3/3p21), 7 (LQT2/7q35), and 4 (LQT4/4q25-27) was demonstrated.	1.9204427616919992
More recently, the disease genes in long QT-syndrome 1, 2, and 3 could be identified.	2.4016181973367074
Analysis of the base-pair sequence allowed detection of several different mutations in different families illustrating genetic heterogeneity.	1.9121695134467438
Aside from diagnostic aspects, molecular genetics may also guide pharmacological therapy by identifying the specific ion-channel disorder leading to QT-prolongation and sudden death.	1.7465273101429868
During the past 4 years we have demonstrated in eyes with corneal pathology that applanation tonometry (Goldmann, Perkins) generally delivers falsely low measurements in comparison to intraocular needle tonometry.	1.8350728502284293
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether impression tonometry (Schioetz) is more precise than applanation tonometry in determinating the intraocular pressure in eyes with corneal disorders.	1.7537135707831508
The case of a 24-year-old woman with a plunging ranula is reported.	2.49747577488377
Primarily, the patient noticed extensive swelling of the neck, which had developed 3 months previously.	2.7426371959202895
The polycystic, firmly attached tumor and the sublingual and submandibular glands of the right side of the neck were surgically removed.	2.2818473920273425
Pathological examination showed a retention cyst by means of a plunging ranula.	2.4721708026394467
The etiology, pathogenesis, clinical aspect and diagnostic procedures for the plunging ranula are described.	2.1810596509015943
Various therapeutic possibilities are discussed in regard to their value.	2.892193156187066
We prefer surgical treatment with a histological examination to verify the diagnosis.	2.523727507137554
The plunging ranula originates on the sublingual gland; therefore, its simultaneous extirpation is recommended to avoid recurrences.	1.9644836643224957
In extensive cases, the additional removal of the submandibular gland can be advised.	2.4315029016777543
Cranial dural fistulae are rare; when they occur, it is usually difficult to detect them at an early stage.	2.407008909712082
With a view to the question of possible progress in diagnosis we now report on seven patients with lateral dural fistulae fed by branches of the external carotid artery.	2.0762942078970883
The examination was carried out before selective arteriography using cw-Doppler sonography and colour coded duplex sonography in combination.	2.227807005300597
Sonographic criteria for detection of hyperperfusion take account of flow velocity as well as pulsatility.	2.69923970737517
In all cases hyperperfusion of the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery was detected.	2.3164407488301
In most of these cases pathologic findings were also observed at the occipital artery, and more rarely in the contralateral external carotid artery or the ipsilateral vertebral artery, in addition.	2.211908012114919
Therefore, cranial dural fistulae characterized by a high shunt volume can be diagnosed correctly by indirect Doppler sonographic criteria using cw-Doppler and duplex sonography.	1.9928353885877308
Direct visualization of the fistula and its nidus requires additional selective arteriography, in the course of which endovascular embolization may be performed.	2.5519754266641246
Background: Echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease.	2.5333895921340144
The good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects.	2.4695122742430358
Dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant jets are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies.	2.0839245999748974
In Germany, as in all industrial nations, there has been an increase in the number of cases of cancer and in cancer-related mortality.	2.4581257732197788
According to the German Federal Bureau of Statistics, in 1998 nearly 213,000 persons died due to malignant cancer.	1.895462279428096
Cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all.	2.132630975605072
Pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family.	2.454388953824552
Although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy, in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians.	2.118395099150703
This work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine.	2.1876656268793018
This retrospective study shows the results in 30 patients of revision surgery on their reruptured ACL.	2.199927425023953
The follow-up time was 30 months on average (range 10 - 54 months).	2.1866806885896573
The follow-up examination included subjective (Lysholm score, Tegner activity level rating score), clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer.	1.9878303970157178
The overall evaluation was done according to the IKDC score.	2.620228098446981
The follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on ACL.	2.045136907364911
The IKDC score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results, which demonstrated that revision ACL surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery.	1.8011853799497024
Nevertheless, we recommend reconstruction of a torn ACL even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration.	1.9943292058024396
Nowadays, restorative proctocolectomy is considered the "gold standard" in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis.	2.515865984709936
Alternative procedures such as Brooke ileostomy or Kock pouch are limited to special indications.	2.146461920452056
Preservation of function is the decisive advantage of the ileoanal pouch, but preservation of function is not equal to quality of life.	2.1431013946287685
Quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to define and measure.	2.146066985321149
Quality of life can only be assessed by standardized and validated quality-of-life questionnaires.	2.4278160688935326
Preoperatively, patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted quality of life, depending on the intensity of their disease.	2.558102000282454
Proctocolectomy is the curative therapy and improves quality of life.	2.3321941824389008
When evaluating quality of life it is not essential if patients are treated by Brooke ileostomy or restorative proctocolectomy.	2.542370285828205
The advantage of restorative proctocolectomy is the improvement in some aspects such as sexuality and physical acticity.	2.132311069132673
The "Total Quality-of-Life Index" is not impoved.	2.379483859708245
Preoperatively, patients should be informed that preservation of function by restorative proctocolectomy is accompanied by an increased postoperative morbidity in comparison to other procedures.	2.3516317363670143
Decreased quality-of-life results when complications occur postoperatively that cannot be controlled over a long period of time.	2.212095973119643
In some cases excision of the ileoanal pouch may be the most sensible way of solving the problems.	2.387381287269919
On the other hand, patients without complications and good function after ileoanal pouch procedure may achieve a quality of life comparable to that of healthy controls.	2.110092745298639
Preoperatively, patients should be aware of this risk-benefit relationship and should share the responsibility of the decision for or against restorative proctocolectomy.	1.9558886930324053
The objective of this investigation was the experimental determination of the contact pressures in the hip joint for characteristic phases of the gait cycle.	2.296824465354183
The joint forces determined in vivo with telemetric endoprosthesis by Bergmann et al.	1.9799695456254327
(1993) were converted into a pelvic reference system, based on kinematic gait analysis.	2.187114619181433
In eight cadaveric hip joints (age 18-75 yrs.)	2.1695792763103694
the reaction forces were applied corresponding to four phases of the gait cycle (heel strike, mid-stance, heel off, toe off) and the pressure distribution determined with FUJI pressure sensitive film.	1.8309720565121745
We found maxima of 10 MPa during mid stance.	2.1272899004107315
The areas of highest pressure were located in the ventro-superior aspect of the acetabulum (anterior part of the acetabular roof) and in the dorso-inferior aspect of the lunate surface.	2.5302438148723283
The pressure distribution was relatively constant during the four phases and the maxima did not vary proportional to the applied load.	1.9326126287862337
In spite of its serious sequelae, volatile substance abuse (VSA) attracts very little public attention in Germany.	1.8193110598679105
Our case report describes an adult male who inhaled propane for recreational purposes.	1.9998852593294316
Initially, he achieved short-lived euphoria and hallucinations.	2.08302995027599
He compensated for the developing tolerance by increasing the dosage, finally consuming 5 litres of fluid propane daily.	1.8910324645879124
Getting such quantities was facilitated by his occupational access to propane.	2.074954438185374
Since he abused the propane in an apartment house, he also exposed third parties to the danger of explosion.	1.8485229655922657
Clinical examination revealed disturbances in orientation, restricted perceptivity and concentration, reduced mnemonic performance, and psychomotor agitation.	1.8903998495751675
All these symptoms diminished during a 6-month follow-up.	2.361154572200782
The relationship of his organic mental disorder to the abuse of propane was not clear, since he had also abused alcohol.	1.8752464097995982
Objectives The Marburg external patellotibial (Mpt) fixator is designed to temporarily protect a reconstructed distal extensor apparatus of the knee.	1.852720500393582
It allows an early functional aftercare.	2.3657738053879003
The indications or ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary disorders are described.	2.4900883300610097
Clinical applications are several lung diseases in adults and especially in children.	2.3826024205468523
In specific, well-defined applications, the feasibilties of ultrasound are promising.	2.229546980017827
Sonography provides important additional information to chest X-ray and is even superior to CT under special circumstances.	2.2530011901392326
Pulmonary sonography is a useful link between conventional X-ray and more expensive cross-sectional imaging.	2.598387125666435
In the evaluation of pulmonary diseases at present the potential of ultrasound is not optimally used.	2.5555577034305808
Traditionally oral surgeons and dentists have evaluated the jaws using intraoral films and panoramic radiographs.	1.9448764103846659
The involvement of radiologists has been limited.	2.416922624454902
In the past few years dedicated CT-software-programs developed to evaluate dental implant patients have provided a new look at the jaws.	1.8930540673493848
The complex anatomy is described and identified on human skulls and on axial, panoramic, and cross-sectional images.	2.0680706794705563
With this anatomic description Dental-CT-scans are used to demonstrate the anatomy of maxilla and the mandible.	2.342811342360301
An overview of the technique of Dental-CT is provided, furthermore the radiation dose of different organs is explained.	2.290892363746796
Suggestions to reduce these doses by simple modifications of the recommended procols are given.	2.057471168693937
The debate on passive and active euthanasia has met a controversial echo both in the German-speaking media and in professional publications within recent years.	2.013626044511228
This discussion, however, largely excluded mentally ill  patients.	2.8796898742509685
Also, euthanasia advocacy groups have usually distanced themselves from  euthanasia in psychiatric patients.	1.9014870224388558
We report here two cases from our hospital in which in-patients with affective disorders committed assisted suicide during a hospital pass.	2.0218414268293077
Definition of the problem: In Germany, the dissection rate of the deceased is distinctly lower than in many other European countries.	2.255385437180573
Currently undergoing a clinical trial a new miniaturized monoplane ultrasound probe potentially enhances the practicability of perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) without loss of echocardiographic quality.	1.8569581878195496
Methods: In the present prospective study, the nasally inserted miniaturized TEE probe was tested in 12 ventilated patients and compared with a conventional TEE probe.	2.528271598018243
Echocardiographic quality was tested by two independent investigators by analyzing the percentage of the endocardium contour detection (<50%, 50-75%, 75-100%) in the left ventricular short- and long-axis views.	2.355619035653752
Results: In 11 patients, more than 50% of endocardium were visualized continuously with both probes.	2.198991453085672
Although the nasal TEE probe was inferior to conventional TEE in detecting lateral endocardium, automated endocardium detection compared well with both methods.	1.887310150289505
Inter- and intraobserver variability in manual measurements of the left ventricular cross-sectional area was below 5% on average and differed non-significantly with regard to the method.	2.314809788945226
In 2 patients, continuous monitoring was aggravated by repeated loss of contact between the miniaturized TEE probe and mucosa.	1.9863081576189536
Conclusions: In comparison with conventional TEE, the miniaturized TEE probe provides practicability advantages without significant loss of information for cardiovascular monitoring.	2.053674176493763
By means of modern color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) even very small vessels can be visualized.	1.975536481598696
Maximum resolution nowadays is about 0.5 mm diameter of the vessel.	2.5480502658853856
We compared the use of CCDS and angiography in studying of acral perfusion.	2.5021582247594747
Besides morphologic criteria, hemodynamic criteria were recorded.	2.2901365731912633
Arteries in healthy fingers appear as long and straight vessels with a clearly defined border.	2.0155264464815543
The physiological maximal blood flow velocity exceded 20 cm/s.	2.177821318049151
CCDS revealed tortuosity of finger arteries as typical finding in thrombangiitis obliterans.	2.005391938609284
Segmental stenosis can either be identified morphologically or quantified by measurement of the flow velocity with poststenotic maximal systolic velocities of less than 20 cm/s or by the acceleration of the blood flow within the stenosis, as proven by angiographic examinations.	2.0440204928078143
CCDS is suitable for evaluation of acral perfusion in patients suffering from secondary Raynaud's syndrome.	2.581438600736021
Apart from diagnosis of disturbed acral circulation, other possible applications of CCDS are in in the surgical field, for example replantations in hand or finger surgery.	2.0044554430171915
The discussion of the Osheroff vs Chestnut Lodge court case in the "American Journal of Psychiatry" raised the question whether individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is the appropriate treatment for severe depression.	1.9378868686201813
A summary of the crucial points and a review of the clinical and scientific implications of this case is presented.	2.566025788497507
In addition, the difference between psychiatrists and psychotherapists regarding the assessment of depressive disorders is examined by analysing results of the ICD-10 research criteria study.	2.23614525796784
In the case of one patient with dysthymia (ICD-10 RC: F34.1) psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists.	1.9676604097674195
By contrast, the percentage of clinicians suspecting an endogenous etiology and thus, diagnosing a psychosis and starting a psychopharmacotherapy was markedly higher among psychiatrists.	1.8969177379836182
In conclusion, the integration of different conceptualizations and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists.	2.057954484102276
For certain patients, an integrated therapy may be more effective.	2.5612712334878553
A 43-year-old patient was admitted for severe claudicatio in his right leg, doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery.	2.109960558244527
Using the cross-over-approach from the contralateral side, it was possible to navigate a guide wire through the occlusion, and after passage with an excimer laser an ipsilateral retrograde puncture with placement of a sheath was performed.	1.9540764068037573
In order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation, a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique.	2.221653063216514
Afterwards three stents were placed.	2.606362298570105
Conclusion: Using the kissing balloon technique, laser-assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments.	1.823862578732062
A surgical procedure can thus be avoided.	2.502419661873597
The typical MRI features of the most common pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, have been established.	3.1166809859042055
However, even in these common pancreatic disorders, MRI correlation with the underlying pathology is limited for clinical reasons.	2.1930667234999337
We emphasize MR-pathological correlation of inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic changes, including pancreatitis, adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, rare cystic and solid pancreatic neoplasms, and islet cell tumors.	1.8585791840209527
By highlighting the correlation of key pathological features with MR findings, a better understanding of the MR appearance of pancreatic pathology can be provided.	2.1374656011669115
In addition, MRI may prove a powerful tool in detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors.	1.9895061360331576
Background: The implantation of a femoro-popliteal bypass graft represents the gold standard in the management of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease in the femoro-popliteal region.	2.2727027418963277
Application of interventional techniques has permitted the development of a novel, endovascular implantable bypass system.	2.257855862415898
The device is placed within the lumen of the superficial femoral artery.	2.135121904932434
The present study investigated the technical properties of the new system in cadavers, with subsequent evaluation of its application in humans.	2.203744488979724
Methods: The endopass consists of a thin-wall polycarbourethane tube with a total length of 53 cm.	2.1767216873884943
The distal end is connected with a self-expanding stent prothesis 4 cm in length.	2.1643326312342612
Endovascular implantation is performed through a groin incision.	2.3312024755912097
Following antegrade ringstripper-TEA, the endopass is introduced into the femoral artery after placement of a guide wire.	2.311060386608823
The proximal anastomosis is performed surgically.	2.402477203004982
Results: The technical requirements and feasibility of the system were tested on 12 cadaver extremities.	2.234188758820658
Implantation of the device proved technically successful in seven of eight extremities with significant occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.	2.162494259400021
The most important problems included the complete ringstripper-TEA, the placement of the guide wire following the TEA, and the expansion of the endopass.	2.1706895709681184
Following approval by the ethics commission, the endopass was implanted in five patients between June 1997 and March 1998.	2.1512422517911833
In three patients, the endopass remained patent and has functioned well.	2.4271863621928813
One patient with poor vascular outflow suffered an early noncorrectable occlusion, while in the remaining case, perforation secondary to the ringstripper procedure forced us to abandon the attempt.	1.899230800385092
Conclusion: Experience from the cadaver study and initial human applications confirm the feasibility of this method.	2.2409620563955395
Introduction: There is no data available on the action of etomidate on ion currents in human neuronal cells.	2.3396309986364714
Therefore the effects of etomidate on a human neuronal delayed rectifer potassium current were investigated.	2.2273260964507715
In order to evaluate patients' exposure to radiation in computed tomography, dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and dose free in air on the axis of rotation are used.	1.8554833054068005
The CTDI and the MSAD, derivable from the CTDI, are a good measure for the absorbed doses in the examined volume, but they do not take the biological sensitivity of the organs into account and do not describe the radiogenic risk that is actually relevant for patients and doctors.	1.945489275873179
The dose on the axis of rotation is not an accurate measure of the effective dose and the radiogenic risk.	2.170981168878874
The declaration of a limit for the dose on the axis of rotation should take the different regions into account, in order to guarantee acceptable image quality on one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other side.	2.1841726749896875
As physical dose quantities, the CTDI, MSAD and dose on the axis of rotation are useful to characterize and differentiate between programs and systems concerning radiation exposure.	1.7672636679491263
Prognosis of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction has substantially improved over the last two decades.	2.5416130178185847
However, stratification of patients at risk for death due to arrhythmic events remains a clinical challenge.	2.2845198440762977
Due to the important role of the autonomic nervous system in the genesis of sudden death, autonomic markers such as heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity have recently gained attention as risk stratification parameters.	2.1058666333015554
The present study reports the results of noninvasive risk stratification in 411 consecutive postinfarction patients treated due to contemporary therapeutical guidelines with a high proportion of patients discharged with a patent infarct related artery.	2.0535746567023287
The diagnostic arsenal of risk parameters comprised heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and more traditional markers such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular late potentials.	2.11152525345323
Patiens were followed for a mean of 33  +/- 21 months.	2.55663671661028
Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular function, both autonomic markers, and the patency of the infarct related artery were independent predictors of the prospectively defined primary study endpoint, i.e., all-cause mortality plus ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	2.031644057330563
With respect to the secondary endpoint (ventricular tachyarrhythmic events), left ventricular function, heart rate variability, and infarct vessel patency were independent predictors.	2.1622049089239495
Ventricular late potentials and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia had no predictive value with respect to ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	2.3079620478903338
These findings from a large prospective long-term study demonstrate the value of markers of cardiac autonomic tone in identifying infarct survivors at risk for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	2.157796131897712
K+ Channels and Cardiotoxicity of Drugs: Implications for Drug Toxicity Assessment - The time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the QT interval of the ECG and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK), which consists of a rapid component (IKr) and a slow component (IKs).	1.9533008710154498
Drugs that block cardiac IKr prolong the cardiac action potential (AP).	1.965652768981992
Prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer QT interval on the ECG.	2.1261594240187898
During prolonged APs, increased inward currents induce early afterdepolarizations, which increase the risk of Torsades de pointes (TdP) cardiac arrhythmias.	1.914088412577768
TdP arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent twisting of the electrical axis around the isoelectric line.	2.187162337482181
It has a rate of 150 to 250 beats/min and it can occasionally degenerate into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal.	2.15004642850799
The incidence of drug-induced TdP arrhythmias is highest among class IA and class III antiarrhythmic agents.	2.0118358098732534
However, under certain clinical conditions, also several non-cardiovascular medicinal products induce QT interval prolongations in the ECG or TdP arrhythmias.	1.8239872658381893
Since all drugs known to cause TdP block IKr, an early evaluation of possible effects on APs of cardiac myocytes expressing IKr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended.	1.9726854269944996
If in-vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce AP prolongation and/or K+ channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations,  either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to TdP arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies.	2.139422919111964
Carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of ominous prognosis if not adequately treated.	2.1464341496455623
To a large extent the probability of positive lymph nodes is determined by the grade of the primary lesion.	2.6098421542468193
In turn the number of positive nodes greatly influences the survival.	2.610132559155948
In the past the complications of radical ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy have decreased their timely indication.	1.9606006703642345
If delayed lymphadenectomy is performed, the survival rate is reduced by approximately 50 % as compared to the results of immediate lymphadenectomy.	2.7462959166603382
The modified inguinal lymphadenectomy described by Catalona leads to less complications.	2.064750125762921
If performed without delay it should lead to improved survival in patients with higher stage and high grade penile cancer.	2.435734548931908
Recently suggested employment of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherpy may further enhance the survival.	2.0051397566291174
On the basis of existing models for psychodynamic diagnostic evaluation and psychoanalytic interview technique and of the theoretical concepts of the 5 axes of the OPD diagnosis, a new type of the psychodynamic assessment interview is presented.	2.069304088986299
The examination is structured in 5 phases: the opening scene, exploration of specific examples for relationships, exploration of experience of self and others, of therapy motivation, and finally clarifying the preconditions for treatment and the ability for insight.	1.9153923041754262
The syndrome diagnosis according to ICD 10 is completed in a final phase.	2.1136293703517604
This psychodynamic-diagnostic assessment interview is recommended, apart from the use for OPD diagnosis, for use a clinical instrument.	2.1921288165566124
Cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most frequent forms of meningoencephalitis in AIDS patients.	2.457275868167381
Before the introduction of triazol antibiotics like difluconazole, the frequency of this meningitis among AIDS patients was 5-10%, yet declined during the last years.	2.327420110912152
Clinically, nonspecific signs of a meningeal inflammation predominate while focal neurological signs are rare.	2.1706767576008414
Rapid institution of high-dose antimycotic therapy is the keystone to improve prognosis and decrease mortality.	2.469987059149111
Antimycotics of choice are amphotericin B, fluconazole, and flucytosin.	2.2868529441088903
Diagnosis is established by detection of cryptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid, microscopic demonstration of cryptococci using India-ink, and cryptococcal cultures.	1.7626180845618749
Recent developments aim to improve antimycotic therapies.	2.3544547701196956
During the last years, life-long secondary prevention with difluconazole was established.	2.139577896860094
Cryptococci which are resistent against fluconazole and amphotericin B are a special challenge, yet fortunately are rare.	1.9183895329010154
Longterm outcome of patients is determined by the progression of the underlying immunsuppression.	2.9976438929805513
Therefore, combination of secondary prophylaxis with modern antiviral substances is important.	2.1477512859915664
Clinical decision analysis in patients with suspected cryptococcal meningitis is presented using methods from evidence-based medicine.	2.39529622837191
The effect of aprotinin (2000000 IU as a bolus +500000 JU/h until the end of the operation) on transfusion requirements and coagulation parameters in orthotopic liver transplantation (study group: n=9; placebo group: n=9) was investigated in a randomised, double-blind study.	2.0663326521218166
Coagulation parameters were monitored intraoperatively using a mobile laboratory.	2.325058906550635
In contrast to the published results, no effect on transfusion requirements could be demonstrated.	2.19726136273649
However, aprotinin showed a positive effect on some coagulation parameters in the reperfusion phase.	2.266510980570398
The mechanism appeared to be inhibition of the contact activation of the intrinsic system with less thrombin generation in the study group.	2.395803827230115
Co-existing inflammation and epidermal hyperproliferation characteristic for psoriasis have been shown to be reproducible in several animal models utilizing a variety of different strategies.These models highlight some points of the multicausal pathogenesis of psoriasis.	1.9637252975129291
Based on observations made in the animal models, a hypothesis is proposed for the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the elements of which can be tested in a recently established xenogeneic transplantation model.	2.3331918763225015
Adipose tissue tumors are often characterized by typical or even specific chromosomal alterations.	2.153891950056319
In some of the cases the molecular background of these microscopically visible alterations was already elucidated.	2.217931439322026
In myxoid liposarcomas the translocation t(12;16) creates a fusion gene between the CHOP gene and the FUS gene and in lipomas the HMGI-C gene becomes rearrranged by structural aberrations involving chromosomal region 12q14-15.	1.6407611941798752
Based on examples of a lipoma, a well-differentiated liposarcoma, a myxoid liposarcoma, and an aggressive angiomyxoma it is demonstrated in the present paper how cytogenetic investigation can be used as an additional tool for an improved diagnosis of adipose tissue tumors.	2.290438205794084
Furthermore, the detection of molecular mechanisms underlying the visible cytogenetic alterations will certainly significantly increase our knowledge about the pathogenesis of these diseases.	2.3920230207673447
The primary goal of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is analysis of submucosal structures that are not visible by clinical or endoscopic means.	2.246665181212268
Therefore, image analysis of the larynx should only be performed under knowledge of the results of clinical diagnosis.	3.3311091499810277
The anatomic relationships of the laryngeal skeleton, the intrinsic structures, and the surrounding soft tissue are presented synoptically.	2.491057095453701
The pattern ERG (PERG) is used as an indicator of retinal ganglion cell function.	2.213301192753245
Up to now, reports on the reproducibility of the PERG have been contradictory.	2.1274328401530256
We investigated the reproducibility under the conditions of the forthcoming ISCEV guidelines for the PERG.	2.2268135481261995
We simultaneously recorded the PERG and VEP in 42 eyes of 21 subjects to phase-reversing checkerboard stimuli with DTL electrodes.	1.7537158118508156
Both transient (2 rps) and steady-state (16 rps) stimulation was employed.	2.002599476841779
The check sizes were 0.4 °, 0.8 ° and 16 °, the mean luminance 45 cd/m2, the contrast 98%, and the field size 32 °x27 °.	2.202135121710309
Measurements were repeated at the same time of day after 1 week.	2.5532591658096813
In addition, we compared two different electrode positions in 16 eyes: (1) across the cornea along the lower lid; and deep in the conjunctival sac.	2.053770194576038
With position (1) the amplitudes were found to be higher by 20% than (2).	2.8720174199940076
We calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of amplitude as a measure of reproducibility.	1.990730180609471
For the latency of the PERG, the intersession CV was found to be 1.5%.	2.362764336910182
Altogether, the amplitude reproducibility of the PERG is somewhat higher than that of the VEP.	2.297279627830481
As a result of physical violence to exposed regions of skin (beating, grabbing) it was possible to effect a mutual transfer of epithelial cells between probands.	1.818995763875904
The majority of these cells were corneocytes with a minimal incidence of nucleated stratum granulosum cells.	1.9792815942340038
Punching onto foil-covered sandbags resulted in a comparable transfer of cells.	2.266615922459119
Punches afflicted to the upper arms resulted in a successful `perpetrator-victim' assignment via DNA typing.	2.1531819216878505
The DNA did not only originate from the few nucleated cells but also from the corneocytes themselves, as positively confirmed by investigations of denucleated cell-suspensions.	1.8030197064849878
The cell concentration achieved in model experiments, however, shows that the forensic value of such a sample is dependent on the presence of nucleated cells.	2.622692260758004
The results of this paper justify the requirement - (having weighed up the appropriate case-specific modalities) - that sampling by taking swabs of the skin regions in question must be carried out as soon as possible.	1.9858141570277112
Ultrasound contrast media increase backscatter from blood thus improving the signal-to-noise-ratio.	2.2483206234869635
Potential clinical applications of intravenous ultrasound contrast are reviewed.	2.2460380191204377
Contrast enhancement of continous wave Doppler is indicated when the native recordings are noisy and no complete envelope of the Doppler spectrum is obtained.	1.8477159701742696
In aortic stenosis several investigations showed good agreement between the gradient calculated from Doppler measurements and the results of cardiac catheterization.	2.2239272406529222
In mitral insufficiency maximum area of the regurgitant jet is a widely used parameter for estimation of the severity of the regurgitation.	2.3502133677322234
However, assessment of the maximum jet area may be not possible because poor acoustic windows.	2.2182775502640237
Contrast enhancement provides complete display of the regurgitant jet in most of the patients.	2.264515645614064
The diagnostic confidence of the Doppler investigation is further improved by the recording of the pulmonary venous flow, which can be recorded in most of the patients following injection on contrast.	2.5102810370036277
Therefore contrast enhanced transthoracic Doppler is an alternative to transesophageal Doppler investigation in patients with poor transthoracic windows.	2.5411012432737756
Since 1993 a report card system for fractures of the neck of the femur has been established in the Department of External Quality Assurance of the Chamber of Physicians of Westphalia-Lippe.	2.1771636205120717
Several indicators of good quality have changed significantly since then: conservative treatment decreased from 6.8 % in 1993 to 4.2 % in 1997, lethality decreased from 6.9 % to 5.4 %, average length of stay decreased from 30.9 days to 24.9 days, average length of stay before operation decreased from 2.6 to 2.1 days, the frequency of operations on weekends increased, complications in wound healing increased from 4.9 to 6.0 %, and cardiopulmonary complications decreased from 11.2 % to 7.8 %.	1.7438482918632923
Between 1993 and 1997, 54.3 % were dismissed to go home; the percentage of patients sent to rehabilitation facilities after acute care rose from 8.3 % in 1993 to 20.1 % in 1997.	1.8470479178236854
Operative treatment was performed in more than 90 % of all fractures in all counties of Westphalia-Lippe.	2.403862488977342
However, there was a wide and significant geographical variation in the choice between osteosynthesis and hip replacement: the percentage of hip replacements differed between 57 % and 82 % among different counties.	1.8847401747748702
Average length of stay before the operative procedure for patients undergoing reduction and rigid internal fixation of the fracture is still too long (1.6 days in 1997).	2.3082680034804985
The etiology of os odontoideum is still controversial.	2.1936530889275945
In most patients, it is found by accident because of neurological symptoms and/or painful range of motion of the cervical spine.	2.656271958251281
Upon recognition of the os odontoideum, it is unknown whether or not immediate surgery is beneficial.	2.6937223444426333
This is in contrast to an "unstable" os odontoideum, which could result in atlantoaxial instability or compression of the myelon.	2.3737794731940958
In this study, we present the results of our treatment of four patients with an unstable os odontoideum.	2.8110993455559066
In all four cases, a C1-2 fusion was performed (3 x Magerl/Seemann, 1 Gallie-Brooks).	2.0035505921176378
Postoperatively, we found a complete regression of neurological symptoms in three patients and one was significantly improved.	2.3826854569327516
The range of motion of the cervical spine was free of pain in all patients.	2.6609138534578496
As a result, we strongly support immediate surgical treatment of an unstable os odontoideum in order to prevent severe and life-threatening neurological complications.	2.481936240583517
Several studies from anglo-american countries indicate that in non-psychiatric hospital departments mentally ill patients have a longer length of hospital stay than mentally well, while in Austria and Germany, until now, no studies concerning this question exist.	2.1118684593715176
Therefore, we investigated the influence of psychiatric comorbidity on the length of stay in 608 patients of medical, surgical and gynecological departments in Vienna and Tyrol.	2.1991724260495604
Based on the Clinical Interview Schedule, 28.1% of the patients in this sample suffered from psychiatric disorders.	2.1739783812853526
The presence of psychiatric disorders, as well as type of hospital department (medical department), higher age, more previous non-psychiatric treatment periods, and more somatic diagnoses predicted a longer duration of inpatient treatment.	2.1355647097093327
To avoid the influence of cofounding variables, psychiatric cases were matched with psychiatric non-cases.	2.135629883637233
The mentally ill group was treated for a markedly longer period as inpatients than the mentally well.	2.1229332855335112
Patients with a diagnosis of dementia or of substance abuse showed a significantly increased length of stay, while we could not confirm this for other psychiatric diagnoses.	2.144182734486317
The development of new cardiopulmonary bypass technologies, special surgical instruments, as well as intrathoracic video systems facilitates mitral surgery via a small right thoracotomy.	2.125633250309829
Functional recovery after bilateral comminuted fractures of the humeral head with posterior dislocation is poor.	2.352982801681865
When reposition and internal fixation fail, the remaining alternatives are (hemi)arthroplasty and/or arthrodesis.	2.2989000012947214
In a 50-year-old patient, we treated the dominant shoulder by arthrodesis; a Neer prosthesis was inserted at the other side.	2.151165837306505
Using this strategy, the advantages of both techniques were combined with an acceptable functional recovery, which ist especially important for young and active patients.	2.1594635981790886
Commonly used regiments for gut decontamination after oral ingestion of toxic substances are induced emesis, gastric lavage and activated charcoal.	1.8538195473505812
It was not until recently that the effectiveness of these procedures was studied systematically.	2.3228138168959016
The results of these studies are presented and the side effects and complications of the different procedures are discussed.	2.834078506101083
Together with the German poison control centers, guidelines for gut decontamination in pediatric patients were developed, based on the official recommendations of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT).	2.055367346926574
The methodology used to assess postoperative continence has a significant effect on the outcome of incontinence surgery.	2.5530837118043053
Retrospective chart review studies consistently report higher success rates than patient questionnaire-based outcome analyses.	1.9521077053594054
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the true long-term results of the Stamey bladder neck suspension procedure using an anonymous patient questionnaire.	2.2900201141606815
Of 172 consecutive patients, 138 (80.2 %) returned a questionnaire on long-term continence, complications and subjective satisfaction with the operative result.	2.159488725251606
With a mean follow-up of 66 months, 65 of 130 evaluable patients (50.0 %) remained completely continent while 15 (11.5 %) never became continent and 50 (38.5 %) had recurrent incontinence 6-90 months postoperatively.	1.8140952110290531
Almost two-thirds of the patients felt either cured or substantially improved more than 5 years after surgery.	2.4709346742754743
Stamey bladder neck suspension leads to a persistently improved quality of life despite a considerable failure rate.	2.5525417080549
Our study demonstrates the advantages of patient questionnaires for outcome analyses and emphasizes the need for standardisation and validation to allow comparisons between the results of different incontinence procedure in the future.	2.184760671855455
Social work for the elderly in a demographical ageing society is not justified per se, but has to prove its utility under the altering social conditions of the changing age-structure.	2.0055075154860478
In the field of practice, this has led to an increasing need for professional orientation and to searching for profiles of performance with greater attraction.	2.081938670916323
Pseudoaneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) can be caused by external injury or may be due to spontaneous dissection.	2.509039721317585
Pseudoaneurysms bear an increased risk of arterio-arterial embolism.	2.52863498676482
Potential treatment regimen include conservative and medical approaches with anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, extra-intracranial bypass, resection of the pseudoaneurysm with vessel reconstruction, ligation or endovascular balloon occlusion of the ICA.	1.932276233886493
Pseudoaneurysms of the ICA adjacent to the scull base require a major surgical procedure.	2.089323356800286
If there are contraindications for vessel occlusion conservative or medical treatment used to be the only therapeutic alternatives.	2.2449022835803487
We report the treatment of two patients with extracranial ICA pseudoaneurysms after blunt injury with stent placement (in one case combined with coil embolization) as a further treatment option.	2.338531121999979
Introduction: The combination of direct magnification mammography and computed radiography provides an improvement in spatial resolution of storage phosphor-based digital systems.	2.110886768327187
A clinical study comparing conventional and digital direct magnification mammograms was performed.	2.145124942133554
Methods: 100 survey mammograms in 1.5- or 1.7-fold magnification and 50 4-fold spot magnification views were obtained with a prototype direct magnification mammography system and a storage phosphor-based digital system.	1.7738246091500494
An intraindividual comparison of these with previous conventional radiograms of the same patients was carried out.	2.347049785706502
Results: The diagnostic value of digital survey mammograms using the direct magnification technique is comparable to that of conventional radiograms of the breast, especially with regard to the identification of microcalcifications and lesions and the clinical consequences.	2.389487824476142
Spot magnification views performed with this combination of techniques allowed improvement in the evaluation of microcalcifications.	2.4104896147902197
In 15 % of cases, diagnostic procedures were adjusted accordingly.	2.723475135478334
Conclusion: The combination of the direct magnification technique with digital storage phosphor radiography systems allows the performance of digital mammography by improving the overall spatial resolution.	2.077880066332053
The diagnostic value of digital direct magnification survey mammograms was comparable to that of conventional mammograms.	2.1847361329064805
Digital 4-fold spot magnification views improved visualisation of the morphologic aspects of microcalcifications.	2.000388986818663
Warthin's tumour of the larynx is an unusual finding.	2.736582700905486
In present literature only four cases have been reported.	2.3918968296233856
Only one case of a woman suffering from Warthin's tumour of the protid gland and the ipsilateral site of the larynx has been published.	2.4878793450845262
A case of a 74-year-old woman with an Warthin's tumour of the right parotid gland and the left false cord is presented.	2.5511296580793883
The theories about the development of Warthin's tumours are discussed.	2.7021828645288464
In rheumatic diseases, radiation synovectomy is a reliable method.	2.698023046815112
Meanwhile, radiation synovectomy is an outpatient therapy.	2.443683852453399
In addition, combination with arthroscopic synovectomy is an increasing therapeutic modality.	2.101441906989474
In comparison to the hitherto inpatient modality, a greater lymphatic emigration of the radionuclide and, therefore, a higher radiation exposure is possible.	2.124245840819448
In 35 patients we found radionuclide emigration in 17 cases by whole body scintigraphy, resulting in a 50%-percentile with 68.27%-confidence interval of 1.8 (0.45-4.78)% of the injected yttrium-90-activity.	1.9900901869672407
Comparison of 3 groups with the above mentioned therapy modalitites resulted in no statistical difference (p>0.05).	2.0432834769124733
Because of the found radionuclide emigration, a radiation dose of 0.1 (0.05-0,18) mSv in women and 0.2 (0.1-0.38) mSv in men was calculated.	1.9395926611393757
For lymph nodes, liver, spleen and whole body radiation doses of 619 (154-1644) mSv, 62 (15-165) mSv, 62 (15-165) mSv and 37 (9-99) mSv were calculated.	1.7214306086487754
Therefore, radiation synovectomy can be used unlimited by patients age and independent of the therapeutic modality.	2.5999820830429687
The goal of surgery using a thoracoscopic approach for the anterior reconstruction of fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine is the reduction of postoperative pain and morbidity.	2.362247046881421
Fusion of the injured segment was performed by partial corporectomy and the vertebral body reconstructed using a tricortical autogenous bone graft.	2.306465504103429
A plate and screw assembly was inserted to stabilize the surgical correction.	2.2392275908340573
This technique was used between May 1996 on May 1998 in 100 patients with 103 fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine.	2.1772596817602197
Fractures from T4 to L3 were stabilized; most fractures occurred  at the thoracolumbar junction.	2.1013542332999795
A monosegmental short fusion was given preference in 51 patients.	2.163302818103632
A dorsoventral approach was necessary in 68 patients on account  of the fracture type.	2.631156923218057
Comparing a group of 30 patients who had undergone an open procedure and a similar group treated under thoracoscopic assistance, we found a marked reduction of the postoperative need for analgesics and the duration of postoperative ventilation.	2.4658518369829854
Pneumatic external counterpulsation operates by applying ECG-triggered diastolic pressure via cuffs to the vascular bed of the lower limbs.	2.0648763208537195
Comparable with intra-aortic balloon pumping, PECP produces a diastolic augmentation combined with increase of mean arterial pressure and coronary perfusion.	1.950877483784198
American, Asian, and our own data demonstrated a reduction of angina pectoris through repeated use of PECP one or two hours daily for four to seven weeks.	2.0181993322702825
Exercise testing and thallium scanning confirmed the clinical improvement.	2.2781827315280108
PECP is a virtually riskfree treatment option in patients suffering from angina despite medical and interventionell treatment.	2.203560964789976
Opening of collaterals and collateral growth induced by external counterpulsation are discussed as the cause of clinical benefit.	2.2926205495483964
Transrectal fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the prostate under digital control is a cheap and rapid method for diagnostic evaluation of palpable and non-palpable nodules, yielding high sensitivity (ca.	2.1016329209546987
95%) and a low complication rate (<1%).	3.20802339279991
Its specificity amounts to >97%.	2.557649668164983
The scarcity of urologists trained in the FNAB method and of pathologists experienced in cytology of the prostate limit the clinical application so far.	2.006603960068333
Besides various forms of prostatitis, five different types of cancer can cytologically be differentiated.	2.296152866292435
While PIN I cannot be cytologically identified, PIN II/III lesions may lead to false-positive diagnoses.	2.1115510598794653
Cytologic grading of adenocarcinomas of the prostate is of statistically proven prognostic validity and strictly correlated with its histologic counterpart.	1.9992096958639256
Preoperative, radiologically controlled FNAB of pelvic and paraortal lymph nodes has sensitivity of ca.	1.9718196845294655
86% and specificity of 100%.	2.7153530693182826
It thus helps to avoid unnecessary prostatectomies if nodal tumor spread has preoperatively been proven.	2.0036624341325493
Diagnostic DNA cytometry is able to identify those prostatic cancer patients who do not reveal significantly increased risk of tumor progression or decreased survival probability, even without therapy (constantly and representatively diploid and tetraploid patterns).	1.959194335574539
Patients with DNA tetraplid histograms may show detoriation of prognosis under hormonal therapy.	1.914935246177052
DNA-aneuploid prostatic cancers should not be subjected to a "wait and see" strategy; they do not respond to hormonal therapy.	2.1397973184398187
Early defibrillation is the standard of care for patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT).	2.50790306558933
Technical developments aim at further miniaturization and simplification of defibrillators as well as adaptation of energy requirements to the patient's needs.	2.3654938887826797
Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD) and automated external defibrillators (AED) are based upon the same technology.	2.0394326213585305
Both devices analyze the ECG signal internally, followed by a "shock" or "no shock" decision.	2.3667608091376713
Use of automated devices is the prerequisite for defibrillation by non-physicians.	2.148002118911966
Chest impedance measurements and use of alternative shock waveforms, such as biphasic, aim at adaptation of energy or current to the patient's individual needs and avoid application of unnecessarily high amounts of energy to the myocardium.	1.9917301390691045
Calculation of median frequency is a non-invasive method for analyzing the heart's metabolic and electrical state.	2.275579664547222
It helps to determine the optimal moment for defibrillation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).	2.2301048874453633
Developments concerning the structure of in-hospital emergency systems or pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS) aim at further reductions in time from collapse of a patient until first defibrillation.	2.1977635127483737
All programs of that kind have to be organized and supervised by a physician who is responsible for training and supervision of the personnel involved.	2.1878717624367376
Spontaneous breathing with Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) or Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) caused a reduction in intrapulmonary shunting and dead space ventilation and improvement in arterial oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.	2.0742692906877154
During spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP venous return, cardiac output and oxygen delivery increased while oxygen consumption remained unchanged.	1.9724748750217664
In patients early spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP was associated with a better arterial oxygenation than in patients receiving controlled mechanical ventilation for 3 days and were then weaned with APRV/BIPAP.	2.0157285660709956
Length of mechanical ventilation, intubation and ICU stay was shorter in patients breathing spontaneously early with APRV/BIPAP.	2.1214957362869122
Therefore, early spontaneous breathing with APRV/BIPAP may be of advantage.	2.1749968037844027
Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a rare but clinically distinct disorder which is easily overlooked.	2.2111129717970393
It commonly occurs in older men and, because of its similarity to epileptic seizures, is often misdiagnosed.	2.3634557912327328
The etiology of RBD is still unknown.	2.290215261517983
However, there is an interesting association with Parkinson's disease which presents some pathophysiological hypotheses.	2.2272798952017365
Treatment is usually successful with clonazepam.	2.497080916800972
Various therapeutic options have been proposed in the treatment of femoral head necrosis ranging from conservative management to total hip arthroplasty.	2.4398985591795053
Since microsurgical techniques are routinely used in orthopaedic surgery, the importance of revascularization has increased in recent years.	2.3667792773323035
Vascularized bone grafting as well as various osteotomies have been considered for the stages II and III according to Ficat and II, III and IV of the criteria of the ARCO system respectively, which also bases on MRI-findings.	2.114084557025517
We investigated the results of 80 patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head treated with a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft, perfused by the A. circumflexa ilium profunda, between 1988 and 1996.	2.1415468491286505
Mean follow-up was 5,6 years.	3.047245348771018
The clinical results according to the harris hip score were good or excellent in 86,1 %.	2.310857570913673
These results correlate with the subjective assessment of pain and of the hip joint function with an average of 7,9 points using the VAS (max.	2.803143568544235
Unchanged radiological appearance over the follow-up period was observed in 47,5 % using the ARCO criterias.	2.5664249859057646
Reviewing the studies using vascularized grafts, about 50 % of the patients with a stage II and III according to Ficat and II, III and IV of the ARCO respectively show an unchanged stage of the disease 5-6 years after the procedure.	2.4488767490051075
Therefore, transplantation of a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft possibly offers the chance to intervene causally in the course of the disease with only little alteration of the biomechanics of the hip joint.	2.1177811895305307
In an enquiry of 250 German-speaking maxillofacial departments, 160 responded.	2.068861028121715
Results showed that a surprising 30-50% of the institutions are still following guidelines for procedures which have been proven by scientific follow-up studies to be almost 100% unsuccessful.	2.3601006809243503
This paper summarizes the results of an attempt to reconstruct the fates of Jewish pediatricians from Germany, Vienna and the German Pediatric Hospitals in Prague between 1933 and 1945.	2.0761389518995808
The relevant archives in Europe, USA, Great Britain and Israel provided facts and relevant dates for 697 Jewish pediatricians who were humiliated and murdered or who emigrated.	1.6856940925742618
Compared with the total number of 1361 pediatric specialists in the three areas, more than 50% of them were Jews as defined by the Nazi racial laws.	2.2185302838038337
So far, 577 cases have been cleared up: 446 of them emigrated to 31 countries; 63 became victims of the Holocaust; other individual destinies included going underground or committing suicide.	1.6674616295484692
The fate of about 120 persons is still unknown.	2.2490873413872503
This paper discusses the probable reasons for the high percentage of Jews in pediatrics, the anti-semitic attitude of the German Society for Pediatrics and the continual humiliation and persecution of Jewish pediatricians in the Nazi period.	1.9627837697755937
We performed a prospective multi-center study in order to determine the causes of  30-day perioperative mortality.	2.6447563048991323
The implantation of a mesh is an essential step in laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery.	2.347712297511244
We present the case of a 22-year-old man who developed an unspecific and refractory syndrome of inguinal pain after a TAPP procedure for a primary inguinal hernia.	2.130102468124232
By a transinguinal approach, 18 months after the first operation we removed a preperitoneal Prolene mesh which had shrunk and folded to 30 % of its original size.	2.019939644672472
The problem of biocompatibility of meshes currently used in inguinal hernia surgery is discussed.	2.0658140099495683
New therapeutic schemes besides cytokine treatment should be evaluated.	2.4690205700447057
The following study analyzes the in vitro toxicity of treosulfan on spheroids of 8 primary cultures of renal cell carcinoma cells.	2.0923220424629045
These data were compared to the toxicity of vinblastine.	2.7301606292335743
All investigations were performed in regard to the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression of the cells, which is one of the main causes of multidrug resistance.	2.7737189585299817
Four Pgp positive and four Pgp negative spheroids were incubated with the drugs in increasing doses.	2.0005545050260425
Toxicity was measured using the MTT toxicity assay as well as trypan blue exclusion.	2.653933875736245
Significantly higher toxicity of treosulfan compared to vinblastine could be demonstrated.	2.174795809033653
In addition, the effects of treosulfan were not related to Pgp expression.	2.39052895953422
These results are encouraging and a phase II study analyzing the efficacy of treosulfan in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma has been initiated in our institution.	2.5146707056264583
Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy renders beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids.	2.232555768537683
Additionally, direct protective mechanisms of estrogens in the blood vessels and myocardium are under study.	2.2672929208433263
Recent findings suggest an improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and coronary microcirculation.	2.279806479204328
Furthermore, it has also been suggested that this treatment has cardioprotective effects on the left ventricular geometry, i.e., nomial left ventricular mass and wall thickness.	2.4668677703654756
Whether the beneficial effects of estrogens are counterregulated by a combined use with progestins is not yet known and requires further investigation.	2.043494411834533
Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide.	2.7572232298822525
Characteristic signs of malaria are special macroscopic and microscopic organ changes, which may also be seen in postmortem examinations.	2.463014620594902
Modern diagnostic tools allow a fast and reliable diagnosis.	2.380319583897059
The symptoms of malaria are rather unspecific, so the correct diagnosis may be difficult, especially if the doctor is not informed about the patient having been abroad.	2.14189561727551
The cases presented also point out possible legal consequences of a missed diagnosis.	2.097224565211674
Prognostically relevant factors based on the histological assessment of the resected pancreas are known.	2.9974245696982065
However, additional parameters, such as biological staging of the intrinsic malignant potentiality of the tumor, would be useful.	2.5084740297590473
There has been no uniform finding of a relationship between CD44 variant expression and tumor progression.	2.1799966882943638
Method: We assessed the expression pattern and prognostic impact of CD44 standard and CD44 isoforms v4, v5, v6, v7 and v10 in 40 ductal pancreatic carcinomas by immunochemistry on paraffin-embedded tumor material in patients after tumor resection.	1.721185796407066
At the time of the investigation neither histomorphological parameters nor the survival time were known.	2.1751633639562518
Results: There was no correlation between the histomorphological parameter and the expression of CD44 splice variants.	2.4616920058778033
CD44 splice variants v4-v10 were almost only expressed in tumor tissue.	2.084577379334165
However, because of the small number of cases this was statistically not significant.	2.6929756676115497
Conclusion: CD44 splice variants may have an influence on prognosis in ductal pancreatic carcinoma.	2.2448999447349274
However, further investigation on a larger number of patients is necessary to confirm these results.	2.7603471504243364
Regarding the etiology of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), congenital bone and/or fibromuscular anomalies, positional characteristics and trauma play a role.	2.2300803443440937
In the clinical examination the AEST test is of utmost importance.	2.184358273222364
The visualization of the subclavian artery and vein by DAS in different positions is mandatory.	2.1827684560831324
Less than 5% of the patients show a subclavian artery aneurysm, but 76% have obstructions of digital arteries.	2.485563959973863
Every patient, must undergo a neurological examination including the measuring of the proximal ulnar and median nerve conduction times.	2.1144114380994017
Anatomical lesions of the subclavian artery, reduction of the proximal nerve conduction times and high-degree venous compression as well as disabling pain during the night with abuse of analgesics are absolute indications for the decompression of the neurovascular bundle.	2.5396505123894406
This is achieved by the transaxillary exarticulation of the first rib together with a cervical rib and fibromuscular bands if present.	2.3150610368553175
The results of the primary operation are favourable: completely painfree 85%, markedly improved 12%, unchanged or worse 3%.	2.1541087652447746
The results of operations for persisting and recurrent TOS are disappointing: completely painfree 48%, markedly improved 31%, but 21% unchanged or worse.	1.805632808350415
Regional perfusion of the lung is not distributed homogeneously within the organ.	2.4885554973745982
This phenomenon has been explained by the classical concept of West et al.	2.092975128911443
based on the isolated canine lung.	3.2348337436113135
The concept stresses the importance of different gravitational forces along the vertical axis of the lung resulting in three zones in which no pulmonary perfusion (zone 1), waterfall-like perfusion (zone 2), and continuous blood flow (zone 3) prevail.	2.3130341892093584
A new concept of distribution of regional pulmonary perfusion is presented which centers on vascular factors which are better suited to account for observed blood flow heterogeneities.	1.9030000849159823
The pulmonary vasculature is composed of repetitions of one structural unit: the vessel bifurcation.	1.9449506590136934
Apart from its size, each single bifurcation is similar to all others.	2.162345042941552
The pulmonary vessel tree can, therefore, be considered to be self-similar.	2.5393761775791055
Self-similarity has been identified as a design principle of living nature.	2.32523156192054
Self-similar objects can produce heterogeneity which is also self-similar when viewed at different scales of magnification.	1.9299079299644024
For measurement of the structure of such objects and their function, i.e., in this case the heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion, fractal geometry is best suited.	2.2858023131807084
Distribution of blood flow within the lung can be described by means of fractal analysis, and all phenomena of perfusion distribution can easily be explained when applying this concept.	2.306663469564152
Furthermore, since the basis of fractal analysis is pulmonary vascular anatomy, it lends itself for the study of blood flow distribution.	2.4616434646292182
A major advantage is the independence of fractal parameters from resolution of perfusion measurements.	2.0168041161451002
Thus, fractal analysis can be used to compare results that have been obtained using different resolutions and different species.	2.343193107557656
Fractal methods have previously been used in medicine for other purposes.	2.4237286763628094
Nonlinear analyses of heart beat variability can predict the onset of malign cardiac dysrhythmias hours before actual appearance in the ECG.	2.101898569511388
Very similar methods applied to electrical brain activity have been shown to allow prediction of epileptical seizures approximately 15 min prior to appearance of clinical symptoms.	2.0079911474371026
In part II we report about the clinical application of the EPTT in 67 patients with a wide spectrum of repairs and reconstructions of the extensor mechanism.	2.601148439498392
48 patients had fresh injuries, 18 of them with severe concomitant knee lesions and 19 patients had neglected rsp.	2.1269945331746993
There were 4 deep infections, two of them related to the MPT fixator.	2.3773275413609354
In the patients with uneventful healing the fixator remained in place for 7.3 weeks in average.	2.125988166973776
The clinical, isokinetic and radiological results were reviewed in 17 patients with an average follow-up time of 37.3 months.	2.535413572126175
There were 5 patients with partial patellectomy and tendon reattachment because of lower patella pole comminution and 12 patients with tendon reattachment ruptured at the inferior patella pole or suture repair in midsubstance rupture.	1.8712694675849149
The clinical results according to the IKDC score were rated in 3 patients as normal, in 10 patients as nearly normal and in 4 patients as abnormal.	2.2167602170933667
This rating was highly dependend on the subjective judgement by the patients who considered their operated knees not as normal as the contralateral knees.	2.1226582555524383
From our clinical experiences and results we can derive that the EPTT enables the surgical management of extensor mechanism disruptions with a minimum of internal fixation material and provides a safe protection of the repairs and reconstructions during the healing period.	1.9591747837325042
The EPTT allows immediate unrestricted functional rehabilitation and early walking without crutches.	2.025702784165538
Thus the EPTT represents an effective alternative to the patello-tibial cerclage with a wire or synthetic ligaments.	1.9688381583559975
Ondansetron is more effective than a placebo in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), but it has not been proved to be superior to established antiemetics for prophylaxis or therapy.	2.4618971883265153
We compared ondansetron vs droperidol for the treatment of PONV.	2.7024146607241963
Our prospective, randomized double-blind study was performed between 15 October 1992 and July 1993; it included 271 gynaecological ASA I - III inpatients who had been operated on under general anaesthesia with intubation.	2.1058196573762786
Patients were excluded if: there was no informed consent; it was an ambulatory or emergency operation; the patient was pregnant or breast feeding; allergies were being treated with antihistamines; drug addiction was present or convulsions or Parkinson's disease; any pre- or intraoperative antiemetic medication had been administered.	1.903376117160267
All patients wishing an antiemetic and/or suffering from at least one emetic episode during the first 24 h postoperatively received either 8 mg ondansetron or 1.25 mg droperidol from identical 4 ml ampoules intravenously.	2.0127724579486754
The verbal nausea score (1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) was recorded every 30 min for 4 h, then before and 2 h after each antiemetic dose.	1.921164350437134
All emetic episodes and the interval between administration and effect were also noted.	2.1635327103415056
Patients were interviewed 36 - 48 h postoperatively on subjective effects, side-effects and individual acceptance.	2.1991373469988953
After oral premedication with diazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopental, in a few cases with etomidate or propofol.	2.21404687526544
Relaxation was achieved with pancuronium or atracurium and, when indicated, with succinylcholine.	2.183235802778027
Muscular relaxation was antagonized with neostigmin and glycopyrrolate.	2.171450306229574
Gastric content was aspirated once after intubation.	2.303738247259951
Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen, enflurane, halothane or isoflurane and fentanyl up to 0.3 mg. Statistical evaluation was performed by the unpaired Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test.	1.9524327237337091
Categoric variables were examined by the 2 test.	2.7532630910110734
Significance was defined as P<0.05.	2.8636894249928324
Of 271 patients, 100 (37%) experienced PONV.	2.3209038268075552
The groups were statistically comparable with respect to demographic data, type and duration of operation, emesis record, perioperative uterotonic medication.	2.332061586988474
Nausea scores and emetic episodes were identical before antiemetic medication.	2.1569364891506617
The reduction of these parameters after medication was similar.	2.2922071623148415
Complete response over 6 h was 60% in the ondansetron and 68% in the droperidol group.	2.3069505367113243
In both groups the first medication failed in 4 cases during the initial 2 h. Twenty of the ondansetron and 16 of the droperidol patients needed a second dose; among these 2 and 4, respectively, a third ampoule.	2.0500445331473416
No rescue medication was necessary over 24 h and a mean of 1.4 ampoules was administered in both groups.	2.1848115759116755
Onset and quality of emetic action were identical in both groups.	2.318387483401528
It was not possible to evaluate 25 interviews due to linguistic or amnestic problems.	2.1277340123169326
Multiple side-effects were noted frequently.	2.9260896176239446
Injection pain was reported significantly more often in the droperidol, pruritus in the ondansetron group.	2.3439716836952447
Ninety-three percent of the ondansetron and 85% of the droperidol patients opted for the same drug for future PONV treatment.	2.0757263309043865
Ondansetron (8 mg) and droperidol (1.25 mg) proved to be equally effective when used as a postoperative antiemetic.	2.3219771693145814
Both drugs showed similar side-effects.	2.565212836739787
Due to differences in methods it was difficult to compare our results to those obtained in other studies.	2.1508365645462857
Paradoxical embolism is well-known in theory but rarely encountered in clinical practice.	2.41632117342214
The typical pathophysiological background is the coincidence of venous thrombosis, elevated right atrial pressure, and a consecutive right-to-left shunting via a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.	2.23634068871575
This review summarizes the results of internal cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in comparison to external cardioversion.	2.881370793655032
Internal cardioversion was achieved by positioning defibrillation electrodes in the right atrium and coronary sinus (alternatively in the left pulmonary artery).	2.4002308600597186
In previous studies also a combined internal/external cardioversion was used by locating a defibrillation electrode in the right atrium together with a cutaneous patch electrode.	2.0003018446654215
Although in comparative studies the success rate of 91-93% with internal cardioversion is higher compared to success rates of 67-79% with external cardioversion, the conventional method of external cardioversion remains the method of first choice.	2.006080373744195
The success rate of internal cardioversion after failed external cardioversion ranges from 73 to over 90%.	2.0618430951111884
Possible indications for primary internal cardioversion are: induced atrial fibrillation during electrophysiological studies, atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery and cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in patients with permanent pacemaker implants.	2.165458004080984
Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the importance of home care for patients with advanced tumor diseases and for their families.	3.1919356921955018
VDD single-lead systems use floating ring electrodes for atrial sensing.	2.0868499454981873
To ensure an optimal atrial sensing function, knowledge of the interactions between electrode design, pacemaker, amplifier and implantation technique is required.	1.9810377285349643
In this overview, technical determinants of atrial sensing concerning atrial ring configuration (surface area, ring spacing, full/half ring), design of the lead (insulation material, conductor coil configuration), and amplifier design (differential amplifier, sensing impedance, bandpass filter) shall be explained and related to determinants at implant (AV distance, site of implantation, atrial position, intraoperative measurement technique).	1.7520053362793635
(1) Ring configuration: Bipolar atrial full ring systems have proved to be efficient with narrow (5-10mm) or wide (15-30mm) ring spacing, as well as bipolar half ring systems with DAB configuration and narrow ring spacing.	2.109313891622067
Especially in a position close to the atrial wall, a wide ring spacing detects a less clear-cut signal than a short ring spacing; on the other hand, with a wide ring spacing, sensing is less compromised if the rings move to a worse position further away from the wall.	2.0086879888691636
A narrow ring spacing detects a sharper signal if positioned close to the atrial wall, but a considerable reduction of sensed P wave amplitude may result if it moves away from the wall or to an oblique angle relative to the atrial depolarization front.	1.8870856076502651
(2) Design of the lead: Polyurethane as insulation material provides a higher stiffness than silicone insulation.	2.049813575015128
A coaxial conductor configuration increases stiffness and consequently the possibility to manipulate the atrial part of the lead.	2.2967433773552233
Thus, if a position close to the atrial wall is desired, the combination of a coaxial conductor coil, polyurethane insulation, and a narrow ring spacing seems most promising.	2.1593825561112605
(3) Amplifier design: For atrial sensing in VDD systems, bipolar sensing, differential amplifier, high sensing impedance (>=2k), and a wide bandpass filter (e.g., 10-100Hz) should be realized.	2.1300362935101806
Especially the inclusion of a relatively low frequency range (10-40Hz) is important, because compared to a fixed atrial electrode, a higher quantity of the atrial signal sensed by a floating electrode is in the low-frequency range.	2.1858336119052337
A position of the ring electrodes in the mid-to-high right atrium parallel to the lateral wall should be the goal.	2.5700901465490964
Correct interpretation of the sensed P wave amplitude and prediction of sufficient sensing after connection with the pacemaker is only possible with exact knowledge of the measurement technique of the intraoperative pacing system analyzer and the connected permanent pacemaker device (bandpass filter, signal peak-to baseline or peak-to-peak).	1.9492175418940696
Attention should be paid to the fixation of the electrode at the site of insertion to avoid postoperative dislocation of the ring electrodes.	2.3941554402546035
Knowledge of different electrode/pacemaker specific parameters and special aspects at implantation is a prerequisite for optimal function of VDD single-lead systems.	1.9079923157267453
Preoperatively, considerations should concern the choice of the electrode (AV distance, ring spacing) and implantation strategy (position close to or rather apart from the atrial wall).	2.0181684411828633
An atrial position may only be accepted if sufficient sensing can be documented with a measuring method similar to that of the implanted pacemaker.	2.13408313160889
Objectives: To investigate the agreement (and its potential dependency on extravascular lung water) between transpulmonary (TPID) and standard pulmonary artery (PAID) thermodilution cardiac output  measurements.	1.7814038899541826
In the industrial Western world, 8 % of the population suffer from urogenital discomfort.	2.1705163567362393
Epidemiologic studies show that the incidence rises with age.	2.744562765939863
In light of the steadily increasing longevity in the female population, clinically manifested irregularities such as urogenital atrophy, recurrent urinary tract infections, irritable bladder, and incontinence pose a challenge to the attending physician.	1.7455541398421868
To this day, urinary incontinence in later life is considered "normal" and "caused by old age."	2.1323674520710116
However, among other age-related reasons, the main cause of this disorder is postmenopausal hormone deficiency.	2.3867936353348798
Thus, following thorough diagnostics, pathological changes in the urogenital tract can often be reduced or altogether eliminated by simple conservative measures such as topical hormone administration, which rapidly enhance patients' quality of life.	1.9026032080299597
The present study gives an overview of the physiology of urogenital aging and the diagnostic and therapeutic means available to physicians to alleviate patients' discomfort.	2.033238073849983
Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is one of the most common pain syndromes in childhood, with prevalence rates ranging from 10 to 20% in all school-age children.	2.0278344054288393
In nearly 50% the complaints persist over many years of their life-span to adolescence or adulthood.	1.8590841973620087
Although the empirical findings have increased in the last decade, our knowledge about the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology is still very limited.	2.3159820142599314
Current approaches suggest that we understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance (biopsychosocial paradigm).	1.868441667880082
In this respect there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial causes (daily hassles, specific life events), psychopathological factors (anxiety, depression, somatization disorder), and social environmental influences (mother's psychopathology, social modelling, reinforcement) in the pathogenesis of functional abdominal pain.	2.0096463553389885
The noticeable correlation with other pain syndromes and functional disturbances indicates that recurrent pain may possibly be a manifestation of a basic somatization disorder.	2.081489530413192
The unfavourable long-term prognosis supports the need for early and specific interventions.	2.575907082363679
Psychological treatment requires a medical examination to exclude organic origins.	2.278028551861404
Some of these invasive diagnostic procedures can be very difficult, expensive and distressing for the child.	2.0947602610429765
Behavioural medicine is based upon having an extensive family history and symptom analysis.	2.2570304538523054
The psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis, reduction of pain symptoms and environmental modification.	2.361319672154017
Although preliminary data on the use of these behavioural medicine programs have shown some promise, further investigations are needed to examine the applicability and effectiveness of specific interventions in the treatment of abdominal pain symptoms.	2.5460029493659766
Dermatologic disorders of the stump in patients with a leg amputation may have characteristic pathophysiologic and clinical features.	2.818259942835346
A knowledge of these factors may lead to earlier diagnosis and avoid immobilization.	2.5895109843340443
There ist no German language review of this aspect of dermatology.	2.2156836750949798
After providing an overview of the problem, including a discussion of prostheses, we review the following problems: mechanically induced blisters, follicular keratoses, epidermoid cysts, stump edema syndrome, acroangiodermatitis (pseudo-kaposi sarcoma) and verrucous hyperplasia.	1.902407466570126
Secondary aortoenteric fistulas are a well-known complication after open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.	2.2983241750289563
This is the first case description of an aortoenteric fistula after endoluminal treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.	2.250431053893455
Preoperative diagnosis by antigranulocyte immunscintigraphy established infection of the protheses.	2.304447387097479
The problem was solved by closing the defect of duodenum, removing the endoprotheses and in situ reconstruction with omentumplasty.	1.8638168009147182
The reasons and consequences are discussed.	2.425203296069927
Concepts in the treatment of craniomaxillofacial fractures have changed over the last 15 years.	2.7150867170959825
Modern imaging techniques have become a central part in establishing a proper diagnosis.	2.1981956127819653
Advanced life support and intensive care medicine allow for early primary fracture treatment.	2.4535972873998553
The former principles of minimal exposure of bone fragments using small incisions have been replaced by principles from reconstructive craniofacial surgery comprising extensive subperiosteal dissection, exposure of all fracture lines, open reduction and rigid internal fixation.	1.8021570876678497
Missing bony structures are replaced primarily by autogenous bone grafts.	2.2169914488908096
In a 20-year period (1974-1993), 4230 patients underwent surgery of the gallbladder.	2.4283106443677727
Acute cholecystitis was the indication for emergency laparotomy in 869 patients (20,5 %).	2.280694039136007
Retrospective analysis demonstrated that after adjustment for age, sex, and mode of surgery - elective versus emergency - advanced age is not a risk factor contributing to mortality in uncomplicated cases of emergency surgery.	2.0081654919766163
Cases of acute cholecystitis complicated by perforation, peritonitis, and/or the presence of concrements in the biliary duct are associated with an increased mortality, however.	2.5053100851054135
The clinical effect of ionidizing radiation on ocular neovascularizations is controversial not only because of the variety of treatment modalities.	2.2306985378100412
The aim of our study was to investigate an experimental model which allows to evaluate radiation parameters and to study the mechanism of the inhibitory effect on neoangiogenesis.	2.1070495297156615
We report on a 59-year-old woman patient with selective IgA deficiency and familial hypercholesterinaemia.	2.095220157912432
To lower elevated LDL levels in the patient's blood, immunoadsorption therapy with sheep-anti-human polyclonal antibodies coupled to sepharose columns was administered.	1.9166692674844081
During the procedure, the patient developed an anaphylactic shock requiring intensive care treatment.	2.5464325354243287
The patient's history revealed a fresh cell therapy with fetal sheep cells 10 years previously.	2.0005762898756
Intracutaneous testing confirmed sensitization to sheep immunoglobulin, which was the most likely reason for the anaphylactic shock.	2.592188894625058
A nationwide survey was performed to evaluate the significance of knee replacement (endoprosthesis) in Germany.	2.5920816659028745
All orthopaedic, traumatologic and general surgeons were asked about their preferred surgical techniques, favourite types of prosthesis and related issues.	1.9126987654716079
Sledge prostheses have been increasingly preferred to constrained prostheses in the last few years.	2.2671913791066847
Unicompartmental prostheses as well as constrained prostheses and high tibial osteotomies are still chosen for special cases.	2.4584505828304275
Revisions were most commonly due to patella problems.	2.3148230963625007
Patella replacement is popular to prevent this problem.	2.38894553560004
Endoprosthetic knee surgery receives as much endorsement among German surgeons as endoprosthetic hip surgery.	1.9303504022379976
An important problem is the increasing costs of the method.	2.4311598637010694
Chronic pulmonary hypertension and septic lung failure display different clinical features resulting in severe disturbances in the pulmonary circulation.	2.1018391611051555
In these diseases, the pulmonary bloodflow is impaired by a pathologic constriction of blood vessels that may lead to right ventricular overloading as well as serious worsening of gas exchange mainly caused by ventilation/perfusion mismatch.	2.2601522094124293
Various mechanisms deteriorating the vascular function may induce both an irreversible and a reversible contraction of pulmonary vessels, respectively.	1.8813963863888221
Two pharmacological approaches exist to reduce the vascular resistance:...	2.5811755024796854
Objective: to examine mortality, mobility, pain, institutionalization rates six month after hip fractures.	2.1135641983236697
Lateral acetabular osteotomy in comparison to three-dimensional osteotomies of the pelvis in hip dysplasia is a simple technical procedure.	2.609943663850622
Contraindications are an age over 8 years and an irreducible femoral head.	2.171718427777222
For a long time we have used xenogenic deproteinized bone wedges from animals.	2.1850033281051773
We now use autoclaved and deep-frozen wedges from allogenic femoral heads.	2.0300619426627637
The wedges are sterilized at 121  °C for 20 min and then kept deep-frozen in the bone bank.	2.0068929563649167
Our results in 109 patients show that this method is very successful; even extreme angles of acetabular index correction are possible with this technique.	1.943404270881908
It is unfortunate that the lateral acetabuloplasty with autoclaved allogenic bone graft is not used frequently and we recommend that this method be installed at all paediatric orthopaedic hospitals.	1.8588180818447357
There are only few publications about the effect of music therapy on pain relief.	2.381165411943576
The intention of this prospective study is to demonstrate the influence of the Nordoff/Robbins method of active music therapy in a group of 12 patients with fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndromes and polyarthritis on pain reduction, life quality and coping.	2.419841604337867
The clinical parameters of each patient were related to the observations in the audio- and video-documented music therapy settings and to the self-reported changes in pain intensity and pain behaviour.	2.144392969310944
There was a significant reduction of pain intensity and pain-related disability in the music group compared to a control group, but no change in the depression and anxiety score.	2.382913794222243
The influence of music therapy could be even better demonstrated in the systematic analysis of the single cases by individual profiles.	2.337860954119431
Active music therapy affects especially the communicative and emotional dimension of chronic pain.	2.1834779917016522
Psychophysiological and psychodynamic models are presented to explain the effectiveness of music therapy on pain reduction.	2.533359321826368
Clinical studies on music therapy as well as on other "art therapies" should relate the analysis of clinical parameters to the descriptive-phenomenological documentation of the therapeutic process to demonstrate systematically the influence of music and art in the individual case.	2.3144173605101117
Background: Retrospective analysis to  assess the value of the sequential arginine-insulin-test (SAIT) in the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD).	2.414048068500183
Case Report: The case of a 57-year-old woman is reported who was admitted for peripheral hypereosinophilia.	2.4779855701306293
Auditory similarities in voices of monozygotic twins have already been described in the literature.	2.273211124249774
However, is there a clinical relevance?	2.7108588116445023
In our hypothesis, comparable prerequisites for an increased vocal load in a profession or in an artistic education of the voice could be due to these similarities.	1.9871026501744682
We compared intra-pair differences with data from a control group.	2.2589991574292134
Moreover, we examined the correlation of intra-pair differences with the age of the monozygotic twins.	2.5172107498159675
A greater difference in older twin pairs than in younger pairs could show the effect of an exogene influence.	2.1199678464659035
In addition to the few phoniatric studies in twins in the literature, we used current methods for acoustic analysis.	2.3159689640882095
We examined seven parameters of vocal performance and three acoustic features in 31 monozygotic twin pairs (median age 36 years, range 18-75 years) and compared them with 30 control group pairs, which consisted of non-related persons of the same age and sex, newly combined from the group of monozygotic twins ("statistical twins").	1.985078330274553
We found significant differences in seven of ten parameters (vocal range, highest and lowest vocal fundamental frequency, fundamental speaking frequency, maximum voice intensity, number of partials, vibrato of intensity; U-test by Mann-Whitney).	1.8177191234863483
No correlation of the differences of the identical twins with age was found in the examined parameters.	2.5949474868512694
The voices of identical twins are significantly more similar than those of non-related persons regarding the above mentioned features.	2.1997339612563733
Thus, the suitability of the voices of monozygotic twins for professions with a high demand on voice is comparable.	2.08556529920654
Results of the group comparison correlate largely with the literature.	2.3625733543922416
The missing correlation with age could be due to the fact that the environmental effects were not measurable, and/or the development of the voice is more influenced by genetic effects.	2.55661806558959
After > 10 000 treatments - our HM3/4 and MPL 9000 have been replaced by the Siemens Lithostar multiline.	1.8621935087868529
As a ESWL center with ESWL as the primary treatment indication for all types of stones in kidney and ureter we report our initial experience with this new multifunctional lithotripter.	1.9254168269585348
The system consists of an electromagnetic shock-wave emitter (Focus 80 x 5 mm) and a digital fluoroscopy unit.	2.127233329266665
Stone localization is achieved in a - 10 ° and + 30  ° position without movement of the patient.	2.3496766625862207
The treatment table itself allows most endourologic and percutaneous auxiliary procedures.	1.9869484924410445
Additionally, an intergrated inline ultrasound is available.	2.235685959403038
From 10/94 to 08/95, 204 male and 96 female patients with a mean age of 50.7 (4-92) years underwent ESWL with the Lithostar multiline.	2.1107999564300557
The mean stone diameter was 10.3 (2-20) mm with 53 % ureteral and 47 % renal stones.	1.9927296338411176
300 patients underwent 480 treatments (average shocks 3673, range 793-8000; mean energy level 5.5, range 1-9).	1.9488643406520065
Stone localization was achieved after 5 (1-39) min (mean fluoroscopy time 3.1 (0.5-16.2) min).	2.1212407953077985
In 92.7 % no analgesic premedication was done.	2.367699442330889
56 % of the patients needed no analgesics at all during ESWL.	2.853802312848905
44 % received 8.1 (2-15) mg Piritramid intravenously.	2.3869931320765407
Epidural anesthesia was performed in only 2.3 % for a second treatment.	2.622179813633963
95 % of the patients had complete stone disintegration.	3.242614295126251
In 68 % disintegration was achieved in one session.	2.6020024582478327
ESWL was repeated for further disintegration in 18.5 %, because of an unsuccessful treatment in 11.5 % and because of technical interruption of the previous session in 2.5 %.	2.069449544109824
We saw subkapsular haematomas in 2 %.	2.4004472668359282
Auxiliary procedures following ESWL were necessary in only 9.2 % of the patients.	2.3071095913950477
In situ ESWL with the new Lithostar Multiline seems to be as effective as the Dornier HM3/4.	2.2830381576387455
Analgesia-free treatment was performed in more than 50 % of the patients.	2.8123275361967317
Auxiliary procedures were less frequently necessary as compared to our previous experience with in situ ESWL.	2.42260805821974
We report on a strikingly frequent referral of former preterm babies with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and subsequent ARDS in our hospital during the winter 1994/95 with regard to the clinical course under application of alternative treatment modalities.	1.9014863309934489
Treatment modalities like inhalational ribavirin, use of bronchodilators and instillation of surfactant had been tried without success.	1.9238754892977614
All children (age: 1-43 months) were ventilated for 6.6 (1-17) days with FiO2 = 1.0 and a mean airway pressure of 16.4 (10-24) cm H2O.	2.0626618717502474
Mean arterial blood gases were 49 (paO2) and 41 (pCO2) mm Hg, the OI was 33.4.	1.941390504220414
By inhalational NO in combination with IPPV or HFOV 4 patients could be stabilized, in the other 6 ECMO became necessary.	2.500169118408747
Two of them died in spite of several weeks on ECMO; 8 children survived and could be discharged home after a mean hospital stay of 3 months.	2.0574347012765277
Even in very severe cases of RSV infection treatment modalities like NO, HFOV and ECMO can be used successfully.	2.1532520699610203
The use of these treatment modalities must be considered before the lung damage is irreversible; in those cases a pre-existing BPD is no contraindication even for extracorporeal lung support.	2.083428201051599
The vascular organization of human spermatic cord was analyzed by means of injection and by casting preparation of the testicular artery and veins of the pampiniform plexus after orchiectomy.	2.141193397670034
After leaving the human testis, the testicular veins are organized in two main groups and form two vein plexus.	1.910754606588923
One of these vein groups forms a tight plexus around the testicular artery.	1.991560437018319
Computer-aided 3-D reconstructions based on the paraffin serial sections of the human spermatic cord allowed us to demonstrate the relation between the blood vessels and the other tissue structures of the spermatic cord.	2.480664032514035
The results obtained allowed us to subdivide the human spermatic cord into three compartments.	2.0894990342036666
The dorsomedial compartment contains the vas deferens and its blood vessels.	2.1085761514960093
The middle compartment contains the testicular artery and the vein group which forms a tight plexus around this artery.	2.1062397906379053
The ventrolateral compartment contains a vein group which shows no topographic relation to the testicular artery.	2.209949010567408
This vein group is embedded in a large, macroscopically visible volume of fatty tissue.	2.081207883761135
To be sure of sparing the testicular artery during antegrade sclerotherapy this vein group should be prepared.	2.011008286682019
It has known for a long time that Sydenham's chorea and tics, as seen in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS), are phenomenologically very similar.	1.903029494642998
Tics may occur as symptoms of acute Sydenham's chorea or persist over years as residual symptoms.	2.0446179232799566
Investigations of children suffering from GTS, including obsessive-compusilve symptoms, have provided signs of a poststreptococcal autoimmune process but also shown that treatment based on immunological interventions has been effective.	1.8876863740422671
We treated a 14-year-old boy showing all diagnostic criteria of GTS, familial susceptibility, and an increase in the antibody titer of streptococcal antigens with 7S immunoglobulins i.v.	2.120208038260672
Response to this therapy was good regarding motor tics, vocal tics, and behavioral symptoms such as disturbed impulse control which still persisted after 9 months.	1.8738324315354133
These findings and the successful therapy underline reports of the literature and point to a pathogenetic mechanism of an immunologically triggered disturbance of the striatal dopaminergic system, at least in a subgroup of GTS.	2.159700903921974
We report on three cases with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes.	1.8885657155994335
Among our patients with isolated IDDM (about 250 patients) no case of ITP was seen.	2.128067437827665
Therefore we recommend that all patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored for other diseases associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II.	2.1888947953945546
The high rate of coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality needs preventive intervention.	2.401702201361404
Several studies have documented the effectiveness of LDL-cholesterol lowering in CAD primary prevention.	2.26615949042568
The West of Scotland Prevention Study resulted in risk reduction by about one third through LDL-cholesterol lowering.	1.9556898219390564
The data indicate that specifically patients at high risk benefit from lipid reduction.	2.224059534508027
High risk patients have besides high LDL-cholesterol one or more additional risk factors such as family history of premature coronary artery disease, hypertension, smoking, low HDL-cholesterol or diabetes.	2.10430819572483
This strategy allows to reduce the number of patients needed to treat in order to prevent one CAD event (56 in isolated hypercholesterolemia) to 14-24 in high risk persons, approaching the number (n=13) known for effective lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.	2.0289639604028378
One hundred and three cases of Spitz nevi were reviewed.	2.415290183635743
36% of these patients were adults.	3.2652579777952413
The lesions in children occurred primarily on the face and secondarily on the trunk followed by the extremities.	2.3718333906343694
In adults, they affect the legs in women, and the trunk in men as does malignant melanoma.	2.39720172314138
Clinically they were diagnosed more frequently as Spitz nevi in children and adolescents than in adults.	2.2486472674298166
Histologically, there are various expressions of Spitz nevi, but they are usually compound melanocytic nevi with little pigmentation and typically large spindle- and/or epithelioid melanocytes.	2.206225038019697
There are only small histopathological differences between Spitz nevi in childhood and adulthood: one important feature rarely seen in Spitz nevi of adults is multiple mitotic figures at the dermo-epidermal junction but rarely at the base of the melanocytic nevus.	1.7366104195248073
Nevus Reed is considered to possibly be a distinctly pigmented variant of Spitz nevus.	2.2689752674879977
A few months ago an endovascular implantable PTFE stent graft became commercially available.	1.9680716860256504
Since May 1998 we have treated 15 patients with extensive vascular occlusion at the femoropopliteal level.	2.253045290074284
The implantation is carried out via a single inguinal approach in combination with conventional vascular surgical techniques like orthograde ringstripping of the superficial femoral artery, local TEA and patch-grafting of the femoral bifurcation, angioplasty, local lysis, etc.	2.040525384546675
The self-expanding thin-walled PTFE stent prothesis appears to be a viable alternative to the femoropopliteal P1 bypass and can be performed under local anesthesia, percutaneously or through a small inguinal incision.	2.2141165922452273
The implantation can be carried out with minimal tissue trauma.	2.653157443087905
Radiological and orthopaedic outcome in severe and moderate haemophilia A and B patients undergoing long-term prophylactic treatment were prospectively investigated focusing on the age of onset of prophylaxis and the number of joint bleedings prior to treatment.	2.372494477913397
Three patient groups were evaluated according to the age at onset of prophylaxis.	2.7840823852345147
In group I (n = 8) prophylactic treatment was initiated in the first 2 years of life.	2.559543129297494
Patients of group II (n = 6) received prophylaxis at the age of 3-6 years.	2.6472697867605763
Late-onset or secondary prophylactic treatment was started at the age of 6 years and above in 7 patients (group III).	2.387334452357361
All patients received virus-inactivated F VIII or F IX concentrates at dosages of 30-40 IU, in some cases up to 50 IU/kg body weight i. v. three times per week for those with haemophilia A and twice per week for those with haemophilia B. Elbow, knee and ankle joints were investigated at 3-4 yearly intervals according to the radiological and orthopaedic scores recommended by the World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH).	1.8835685959432023
The total number of joint bleedings before and after start of prophylaxis were recorded in all patients.	2.400539026350553
In group I 7 out of 8 patients had unaffected joints with constant radiological and orthopaedic scores of zero or 1, after a median of 11.25 years of prophylactic treatment.	1.9269474964150983
One patient in this group demonstrated mild radiological alterations (score 4).	2.277595208006325
Patients of group II showed neither radiological nor orthopaedic alterations at study entry.	1.9546869894873178
Worsening joint scores could be detected despite ongoing prophylaxis after the 3-year interval (median orthopaedic score 4, median radiological score 8).	2.160788062134204
Treatment group III already showed considerable joint damage at study entry with a median radiological score of 11 (0-33) and a median orthopaedic score of 4 (0-11).	2.218873971639247
Despite prophylactic treatment both, orthopaedic (median 8, range 2-12) and radiological scores (median 19.5, range 2-47) deteriorated after 3 years.	1.9405254496397994
Prior to onset of prophylaxis no or only one joint bleeding occurred in treatment group I.	2.2062431505744637
In group II, a median of 6 joint bleeds (range 1-8) were reported before prophylaxis was started.	2.290500035655734
Patients of group III usually experienced a median of more than 10 joint haemorrhages (range 6-10 or more).	2.33877726173506
Under prophylactic treatment the number of joint bleedings decreased significantly in groups II and III.	2.613369593560047
However, radiological and orthopaedic scores increased as a sign of progressing osteoarthropathic alterations in patients reporting more than 6 joint haemorrhages before onset of prophylaxis whereas no joint alterations could be assessed in patients with no or only one joint bleeding episode prior to prophylaxis.	2.107640083939065
Even a small number of joint bleedings seems to cause irreversible osteoarthropathic alterations leading to haemophilic arthropathy.	2.1323107795424394
Once apparent, further progression of joint damage could not be arrested despite of prophylactic treatment (group II and III).	2.3508761302911827
In order to prevent haemophilic arthropathy, effective prophylaxis should be started before or at least after the first joint bleeding in severe haemophilia A and B.	2.167541380219884
The hemodynamic treatment of septic shock consists of fluid repletion, maintenance of an adequate cardiac output, and restoration of mean arterial pressure.	2.0717083933761047
Norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor that can be considered when the patient is adequately fluid resuscitated, when cardiac output is greater than 3.5 l/min/m2 (or Sv O2>=65%) and when blood pressure remains low.	2.259862717927228
The objective is to achieve and maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60-70 mmHg, or more in some patients (older or hypertensive patients).	2.0499121405677947
Renal effects of norepinephrine were evaluated in several studies; urine output, creatinine clearance, and osmolar clearance are significantly increased.	2.0505962891902914
Norepinephrine is perfectly suited in situations of high renal output and low renal resistance, as is the case in septic shock patients.	2.0181446820495292
The effect on oxygen transport is unpredictable.	2.2680315211008892
The effects on lactate concentrations were poorly evaluated, but several studies suggest that the drug does not worsen and can even improve tissue oxygenation of septic shock patients.	1.9895632569529187
Provided that cardiac output is maintained, treatment with norepinephrine is without negative effects on splanchnic tissue oxygenation.	2.126597089612008
In conclusion, the clinical experience with norepinephrine strongly suggests that this drug can successfully increase blood pressure without deteriorating cardiac output and organ function.	1.9881572536967154
Whether using norepinephrine in septic shock patients effects mortality as compared to dopamine or epinephrine still requires a prospective study.	2.207550907620585
Is it possible to find a correlation between the localisation of neovascularisations and the localisation and extension of the retinal ischemia?	2.5806178269687874
Ischemia was recognized not as capillary non-perfusion but as impaired retinal perfusion.	2.024515555280582
Elderly patients with known episodes of atrial arrhythmia and indication to pacemaker therapy are borderline cases relative to selection of ventricular single-chamber or dual-chamber pacemaker.	1.956540912211771
The frequency of recurrence of arrhythmic episodes under dual-chamber pacemaker therapy is there the most important criterion.	2.2863451722423265
The long-term history of 39 patients with known intermittent or durably successfully treated episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter was compared with 24 patients with new atrial tachyarrhythmia after pacemaker implantation.	2.153433713773174
There was no significant difference in the frequency of recurrence and in therapy efficiency of atrial tachyarrhythmia between both groups.	2.424115095702324
The results show the benefit of implanting a dual chamber pacemaker also for patients with a known history of atrial tachyarrhythmia.	2.5221197772231783
It therefore, should be postulated for therapy of those patients.	2.5994933022472737
Although the risks and side effects of blood transfusions have been significantly reduced during the past years, the potential infectious and immunologic side effects still require a clear and restricted indication before each transfusion is performed.	2.1289144987627218
However, the transfusion errors before and during administration of blood components nowadays represent the highest risk in particular for critical care and high risk patients.	2.061766166481628
This article focuses on the specific problems of handling, preparation, and practical performance of transfusions.	2.1485877775783333
Some practical aspects and problems of transfusions are examplary shown for intensive care and high risk patients, such as immunosuppressed, transplanted or polytraumatic patients and critical care premature neonates.	2.0772564152436988
Vincent's angina (Plaut-Vincent) is the most prominent disease caused by coinciding infections from fusibacteria and spirochaeta both belonging to obligate anaerobic bacterias.	1.9542429814606432
A possible symbiotic infection of both anaerobics may become manifest on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and the oropharynx beside the tonsillas.	1.930637101953169
We report the case of a 29 year old female patient with necrotizing ulcera of the soft palate suspicious for stomatitis ulceromembranacea.	2.123037835585619
In case necrotizing inflammations of the oral cavity area were to be found infections due to anaerobic bacterias should be considered mostly occuring as mixed infections.	2.1511208844621574
The correct identification by cultivation turnes out to be difficult in that it requires special conditions.	2.179115595886534
Furthermore, reliable detection of these bacterias necessitates careful collection and transport of patients specimens.	2.023889149953492
In case of Fusospirochaetosis (Fusotreponematose) a specimen should be prepared for microscopic examination beside setting up a special culture.	1.850603308631328
This is because the staining is the most suitable procedure for bacteril identification to support the clinical diagnosis of stomatitis ulceromembranacea.	2.3283339096692703
Quantitative tissue Doppler echocardiography is a new diagnostic approach to left ventricular systolic performance.	2.4555015379480243
The aim of the present study was to validate a recently developed method based on the computer software TDI-Labor enabling a variable time and space related measurement of regional wall velocity from tissue Doppler images.	1.8877561512598713
The same images were employed for comparative measurement of the mean endocardial velocity using the conventional M-mode slope approach.	2.1097506410234232
Tissue Doppler data of the subendocardial wall velocity were found to correspond closely to the mean endocardial wall velocity (y = 0.97x + 0.17; r = 0.77; p < 0.0001).	1.9341235701082795
The average wall motion gradient of the population was 1.33  +/-  0.35.	2.2061146430269747
Wall motion velocity and wall motion gradient were shown to be not age dependent.	2.265023323936374
Historically, the profession of geriatric nurse has arisen from the care of the sick and has developed very differently from region to region.	1.9148465611294971
A question as to the status of development of the profession of geriatric nurse cannot be answered by reference to the current status of legislation on professional law matters.	2.3442042006342123
If experts in that field focus too long on such matters, there is a danger that decisive developments in the profession of geriatric nurse take place outside their field of vision.	1.9697204518563984
It is reported about the recent detection of not yet compensated victims of forced sterilisation during the Third Reich.	1.9269574182638247
The author describes the current state of compensation practice.	2.395403982595763
From a global viewpoint, tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases of our time.	2.309283877947748
The situation in Germany, as in most comparable industrialized nations, is stable.	2.3785270241012846
The declining trend of previous years continued in 1997, when 11,163 people developed active tuberculosis - an incidence of 13.6/100,000.	1.9380422214264403
However, the tuberculosis  problem cannot be restricted to one country, and Germany is particularly affected by trends in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet countries.	2.0531514731076204
These countries experienced a marked increase of tuberculosis  cases and resistant strains during recent  years, a tendency which can only be countered by fast, well-aimed and efficient action in the affected areas.	2.106265914125113
The industrialized nations in particular should consider financial and logistic contributions as their duty.	1.989127044337777
Crucial for control of the tuberculosis situation  within each country are registration and  close observation of epidemiological trends, identification of high-risk groups, and continuation of established tuberculosis control measures.	2.0079555825577473
We report about a 61 years old patient, who suffered a rare ulnar dislocation of the ellbow after being arrested by the police.	2.258180444772211
We report on the eighth known case of a mature metastasis of a mature teratoma of the testis.	2.2776268385351006
This case - in addition to those published previously - emphasizes the fact that a mature teratoma of the testis has to be regarded as a malignant tumor in adults.	2.4430503016200507
It is supposed that the mature teratoma originates, as other testicular tumors, from carcinoma-in-situ-cells, which are responsible for metastasize and are not detected after lysis.	2.1747351509084356
Even the suspicion of an extranasopharyngeal angiofibroma or an angiofibroma in young children must be viewed in general with skepticism, although reports of angiofibromas with atypical localizations and manifestations in young children have appeared in the literature.	1.8329023907157271
In all three cases the neoplasm was resected via an endonasal, micro-endoscopic approach that avoided an external incision.	1.978945053433118
According to the literature and based on our own experiences with typical histological findings in all three cases, the clinician has to be aware that the rare angiofibroma can occur in pre-adolescent children with atypical localizations.	2.385816729984095
The endonasal surgical approach is without any doubt the least traumatic one and in selected cases allows resection of a circumscribed tumor considering functional and aesthetic aspects.	1.9845310997705394
Objective: Chronic recurrent abdominal pain in childhood is frequently due to a Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis.	2.414936832543029
The diagnosis should be verified either by gastric biopsy culture or by histological investigations of the gastric mucosa in children.	2.0375712295578
The gastroscopy necessary for this often requires general anesthesia.	2.2322732266636702
The purpose of the present study was to etablish whether an ELISA for Helicobacter pylori has an adequate predictive reliability with regard to the putative gastric histology in order to possibly prevent unnecessary biopsies and associated anesthesias.	2.150547044493293
Complete dislocated fractures of the thoracic spine may have no neurological deficits if separation is present in the middle of the dorsal column.	2.456732520999612
In this case there is no injury to the spinal cord, because the "saving fracture" of the vertebral arc prevents it.	2.710341740073555
One case of a severe dislocated fracture at T11-12 is reported.	2.330748809888223
In practice, a complete set of X-rays should be done after high-speed trauma, even if no neurological deficit is present.	2.3298776114109963
The treatment is operative by open reduction and fusion from the ventral or dorsal column.	2.0704772544506396
Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring transmitter in the mammalian brain, related to sleep regulation and possibly to energy balance in diving or hibernating animals.	1.860189100432931
It has been used for almost 35 years as an intravenous agent for induction of anaesthesia and for long-term sedation.	2.55086654609792
Its convincing pharmacological properties, without serious adresse effects on circulation or respiration, are compromised by its unpredictable duration of action.	1.9291345349011388
This is not a major problem with long-term sedation during ICU treatment.	2.8422248332424718
GHB has been used with good results for sedation of patients with severe brain injury, where it compares favourably with barbiturates.	2.502937853505716
In animal studies, it seems to possess a protective action against hypoxia on a cellular and whole organ level.	1.9618198123850388
However, in some experimental animals GHB has been shown to produce seizure-like activities, and the compound is being used to produce absence-like seizures.	2.2858105017111483
GHB has been used in our ICU for years to provide adequate sedation for patients under controlled ventilation or for patients figthing the respirator during spontaneous respiration.	1.9867591935936182
No serious side effects were observed in these patients, while in some patients under haemodialysis hypernatraemia and metabolic alkalosis developed; both were reversible after discontinuation of GHB and restriction of additional sodium input (Somsanit, the commercially available GHB preparation in Germany, contains 9.2 mmol sodium/g; the daily dose averages 20-40 g GHB, i.e.	1.9549749345635963
Hemodynamically unstable patients who are brought to the emergency room with blunt abdominal trauma will go directly to the operating room after a rapid ultrasonography examination with evidence of hemoperitoneum.	2.1382261937941722
In hemodynamically stable patients, in addition to ultrasonography, computed tomography can be done.	2.666957126109439
This is especially efficient if evaluation with sonography is not completely possible or shows little pathology (e.g.	1.8960436685477482
small amounts of hemoperitoneum).	2.5935704780253284
We report on a posttraumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk, something which is rather rare.	2.0734405997458056
The injury was caused by blunt chest trauma following a car accident.	2.2746934906975347
Computed tomography could not find the brachiocephalic lesion.	2.2774538772585564
In patients with fractures of the upper ribs after blunt chest trauma, angiography should be done to exclude severe injuries of the aorta and brachiocephalic vessels.	2.5464365332297443
Even after the strengthening by the law of 1997, the German criminal law regarding corruption is no obstacle for cooperation between medical research and industry.	2.007884297839929
The injustice of corruption is an irregular exchange between performing one's duty and benefits.	1.9331974412117703
According to this, an enterprise may give funds to a scientist for research purposes if no counter performance exceeding the research is associated with this.	2.115297897921747
However, it makes a difference if the scientist has to show his appreciation by influencing economic decisions of the clinic in favor of the enterprise.	1.8977121584448589
In case of such an injustice, it is, under the new law, no longer important if the benefit is destined for the scientist himself or for another person or organization.	1.9837191619870331
Thus, it is in the interest of both research and industry to avoid the suspicion of corruption in the first place.	2.6337173460110077
A prerequisite for this is the strict observance of the legal and administrative regulations concerning projects financed by third-party funds.	1.9643280865304389
Since the immune system plays an important role in the rejection of tumours, current tumour therapy includes immunostimulation.	2.241724001287953
This can be done by interleukin 2 (Il-2), which activates T and killer cells and induces lysis of the tumour.	2.352049493190397
Because the intravenous application of Il-2 may have serious side effects, we treated two patients with peritumoral injections in a pilot study.	2.2888709185236076
Both patients suffered from multiple cutaneous metastases of melanoma.	2.447169663785199
A total of 31 and 39x106 IU recombinant Il-2 (Proleukin) respectively was injected in increasing concentrations in one metastasis of each patient.	1.9601449896597098
Histologically, almost complete necrosis of the tumour was induced.	2.7174222169214564
In comparison with the control specimen, the T-cell-rich infiltrate increased intra- and, in particular, peritumorally.	2.4348447097736794
While the ratio of helper to suppressor T cells remained unchanged, the proportions of NK cells, monocytes/macrophages and IL-2-receptor-bearing cells increased.	2.1563545031901894
This reaction was restricted to treated metastases.	2.3491270823319828
No clinical side effects or laboratory changes were registered apart from local erythema and swelling.	2.104958601076993
Wear of the articulating components (especially PE-UHMW) of total hip endoprostheses is the most important technical factor limiting the functional lifetime.	2.2249514554568193
To minimize wear debris, ceramic heads, according to ISO 6474 (Al2O3), have been used, from 1969 paired with Al2O3 and since 1975 paired with PE-UHMW.	1.9464878455487915
Al2O3 balls articulating with cups made from CFRP have been in clinical use since 1988.	2.0628435322867964
Laboratory experiments and in-vivo testing showed minimized wear debris and mild biological response to wear products using CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced plastic) instead of PE-UHMW as the cup material.	1.7989215825548204
The articulating surfaces of retrieved ceramic heads (Al2O3 - Biolox) and cementless CFRP cups (carbon fiber reinforced plastic, Caproman) were compared using sphericity measurement techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and roughness measurements (including advanced roughness parameters Rvk or Rpk according to ISO 4287).	1.6334154560702687
Altogether, the first results of the clinical study showed that the combination Al2O3-ball/CFRP-cup came up to the expected lower wear rates compared with the conventional combinations.	2.5073736117300207
Two cases where DNA typing has been carried out for stain analysis are described.	2.1543318237533406
In both cases Y chromosomal STR systems have been used in combination with autosomal STR systems.	2.5691904633645324
In the first case the DNA from the fingernails of a female victim with skin particles of the male murderer was typed.	1.9580624053757623
The male DNA in this mixture of male and female DNA could be typed.	2.106529991161423
The excess of female DNA in the samples did not distrub the PCR reaction of Y-chromosomal systems.	1.9736175215939893
In the second case several body parts could be identified to belong to a single male person.	2.0178325900051646
The typing of the suspect's DNA did not give any information because of a family relationship.	2.2427810255634077
Different kinds of stains have been analysed with DYS 389 I/II, DYS 390, DYS 391, DYS 392 DYS 393 and DYS19.	1.7639028969613795
Two multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to save time and stain material.	2.3274833352402777
Although the Y-chromosomal systems are not as polymorphic as autosomal STR systems the analysis of combined haplotypes can give additional information in forensic casework.	2.0070638643008936
In a prospectively designed randomized study, we compared the efficacy of sublingual nitroglycerine and intravenous enalaprilat in the out-of-hospital treatment of 46 hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema (defined as rales over both lungs and systolic blood pressure >200 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure >100 mg).	1.9688791368396963
The out-of-hospital treatment consists of oxygen (6 Ll/min) via a face mask, furosemide 80 mg i.v., opioids 10 mg s.c., and either sublingual nitroglycerine (n=23; initial dose: 0.8 mg; repetitive application of 0.8 mg every 10 min until a cumulative dose of 3.2 mg) or intravenous enalaprilat (initial dose: 2.5 mg; repetitive application of 2.5 mg every 30 min until a cumulative dose of 10 mg).	1.7444342840373421
The aim of the antihypertensive treatment was a reduction of systolic blood pressure below 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg until admission to the emergency department.	2.098591994083711
In the emergency room, an arterial and venous blood sample was taken to determine the respiratory (pO2, pCO2) and metabolic status (pH value; base-excess; serum lactate) of the patient.	2.178088812627161
Successful antihypertensive treatment was observed in 13/23 (57%) patients of the enalaprilat group and 15/23 (65%) patients of the nitroglycerine group (p=0.54).	2.2414102557948863
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure on admission were similiar in both treatment groups (systolic RR: enalaprilat: 179 [31] mm Hg; nitroglycerine: 184 [38] mm Hg; p=0.59; diastolic RR: enalaprilat: 96 [14] mm Hg; nitroglycerine: 101 [14] mm Hg; p=0.12).	1.7945764784004483
No significant differences were observed between the enalaprilat and the nitroglycerine groups concerning respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission (pO2: 67 [15] vs. 64 [17] mm Hg; p=0.50; pCO2: 46 [9] vs. 47 [13]; p=0.75; pH value: 7.27 [0.12] vs. 7.27 [0.09]; p=0.98; BE: -4.2 [3.7] vs. -5.7 [4.1]; p=0.23; lactate: 4.2 [3.3] vs. 4.2 [2.7]; p=0.98).	1.5169821755904642
Intravenous enalaprilat did not exhibit any advantage compared to nitroglycerine in terms of blood pressure reduction or respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission to the emergency room.	2.2435827374230812
We conclude that enalaprilat is no substitute for nitroglycerine in the out-of-hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema.	1.9372592642333313
Paragangliomas of the glomus caroticum are relatively rare, but highly vascularized neoplasmas, which develop from chemoreceptors.	2.0482957170415355
Paragangliomas grow very slowly and are most always of benign origin.	2.1348259192866563
There is a familial predisposition, and an autosomal-dominant transmission is presumed.	2.336189680744645
We describe the case of a 47-year-old male patient who was referred to our department because of a progressive swelling of the neck on both sides.	2.648202713108041
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography had displayed soft tissue tumors in the jugular regions.	2.258447055267123
We performed an operative exploration, which showed a highly vascularized tumor.	2.255617878542844
An angiography of the neck and thoracic region, furthermore, revealed an additional paraganglioma in the anterior mediastinum.	2.269109981899041
Using a surgical approach via lateral cervicotomies and thoracotomy the paragangliomas were extirpated.	1.9574483541419814
Our case report demonstrates the rare polytopic manifestation of paragangliomas.	2.1667841765665075
This perivascular neoplasms have to be removed before haemodynamic complications develop.	2.5425698569037896
The extent of this tumors is clearly illustrated by use of an angiography.	2.1689681628010042
Because of the familial predisposition, clinical and radiological examinations of relatives are mandatory.	2.3177617345353054
In more than 30 years of development of intensive care medicine (ICM), our speciality has acquired moral and ethical standpoints, although not without public pressure and discussions.	2.0272866903935047
Special commissions dealing, e.g., with brain death, terminal care, ethics of foregoing life-sustaining treatment in the critically ill, withholding or withdrawing mechanical ventilation, and other issues have meen formed in a number of medical societies.	2.0901688335674957
With increasing experience, a multitude of ethical problems have arisen in ICM that have to be dealt with, such as the issue of quality of life.	2.3584286921792668
What is an unworthy life?	2.8362068562118448
Are we allowed to make judgments for our patients?	2.472549463684737
What is cost-effectiveness in ICM?	2.91123462795112
Other restrictions include bed and equipment shortages in the intensive care unit (ICU), the necessity for triage - undisputed in catastrophe medicine - and how one should proceed in managing elective patients?	2.0228567899378
In situations of limited ICU bed availability, sicker patients will be admitted, sparing out patients who are less ill for observation and those with poor quality of life and poor prognosis.	2.0896484411558225
For the future, it will likely be necessary to define the patients who should be admitted to an ICU more than those who should not be admitted.	2.3562036450461337
An ICU treatment entitlement index would be directly proportional to the probability of successful outcome and the quality of the remaining life, and would be inversely related to costs for achieving success.	2.1945682999016207
The ICU outcome with survival, hospital mortality, and follow-up of ICU patients is considered.	2.439283304683995
DNR (do not resuscitate), the dying patient, terminal care, terminal weaning - DNT (do not treat) - active and passive euthanasia, living wills, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness for ICU patients are defined.	2.0723812434189095
Their application in the ICU will be discussed and problems pointed out.	2.531481309068215
Outcome predictions using scores (APACHE III, SAPS II, MPM) have been developed based on previous experience, but should only be applied to patient groups and for quality assurance in ICUs.	2.1353725139944295
The most frequent and difficult problem in the ICU is the vegetative state, which requires an exact diagnosis.	2.192019927502091
The differential diagnosis from other comatose states such as coma, brain death, and locked-in-syndrome is depicted.	2.010833342625255
The ethics of interrupting life-sustaining treatment in critically ill patients have been worked out by a Task Force on Ethics of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (1990).	1.959800079224383
A consensus was found that the patient may judge to forego therapy; ethically it is then appropriate to withhold or withdraw therapy.	2.063941770335177
According to the consensus, withdrawing an already initiated treatment should not necessarily be regarded as more problematic than a decision not to initiate treatment.	1.9652723644687693
In my mind, however, there is a great difference between withdrawing or withholding, e.g., ventilation.	2.6027154988384127
A dissentive opinion by some members of the Task Force stated that hydration and nutrition other than high-technology or parenteral nutrition are key components of patient care, and should not be equated with medical intervention.	1.9598157182387486
The ethical problems associated with active euthanasia (physician-assisted suicide or death) as practised in the Netherlands are also discussed.	1.9067434445268197
In most countries this practice seems unacceptable.	2.2222483389697856
Care decisions for single patients in unacceptable situations should be made after medical evaluation by the intensivist with the medical team and, if possible, by the patient and/or his or her surrogate.	2.4115697930091176
Legislation and solutions cannot be expected for single patients, but ethics committees could be helpful in decision-making.	2.2381686910006455
Pseudarthroses of the spine are classified into congenital, acquired non-traumatic, posttraumatic and postoperative (iatrogenic) pseudarthroses.	2.096589821296431
The various types of non-unions of the spine are described according to their clinical and radiological appearance.	2.8567946167644145
In line with their clinical importance, special attention with respect to the operative treatment is given to non-union of the axis of C2 and to spondylolysis.	2.5548128693260623
For the pseudarthrosis of the dens a posterior fusion according to Gallie-Brooks is recommended, in spondylolyses without marked slipping a "direct repair" should be considered in young patients.	1.9635185301275104
The rate of responders 63 %.	2.434030771873687
In relapse-free patients both the whole tumors and the vital areas there of were smaller than in patients with relapse during a follow-up period of 5 years.	2.389518246793487
Within the subgroup of osteoblastic osteosarcomas, metastases were observed following smaller tumors than in chondroblastic osteosarcomas.	1.9876566614985098
Therefore, in addition to degree of regression, histological subtype and tumor size should be considered in the prognostic evaluation of osteosarcomas.	2.1368742163912775
The possibilities of using different material combinations for the replacement of knee joint endoprostheses are very limited.	1.974372305134597
Therefore, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys are currently being used for femoral components and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for tribologically stressed tibial components.	1.7643533528437647
Titanium alloys can be considered for the tibial component only.	2.712456065416142
The fixation of hamstring grafts in ACL reconstruction requires a connector device.	2.0781329714083014
During the process of ingrowing the graft stability depends entirely on the fixation.	2.2054504248582716
The following study focused on the mechanical conditions of no 6 Ethibond, 5 mm Mersilene tape and 5 mm Polylene tape.	1.9921836613852486
The material were tested as loops with a length of 30 mm including the knot similar to intraoperative conditions.	1.9508715302089459
The ultimate tension load and elongation of the conditioned and unconditioned loops were investigated under cyclic load of 50 N and 100 N using a tension load machine.	1.822498618913966
The ultimate tension load increased significantly only for Mersilene from 416 N to 462 N. However, the highest ultimate tension load showed Polylene with 479 N. The oscillating load up to 100 N revealed for unconditioned loops and elongation of 4.1 mm for Ethibond, 2.9 mm for Polylene and 5.4 mm for Mersilene.	1.7175980215503142
The elongation decreased significantly for the conditioned loops to a maximum of 1.4 mm.	2.1813284012160965
Concerning the amplitude during the period of oscillating load there was found a significant reduction as well.	2.3594610865929537
Based on our results Polylene showed the best mechanical properties.	2.2369023875021963
Regardless the intraoperatively used material we advocate the conditioning of the loops before anchoring the hamstring graft in ACL reconstruction.	1.8591245580178652
On the basis of the results of 327 knee arthroscopies in children aged between 2 and 17 years in the period from 1985 to 1995 we attempt to evaluate the current status of this procedure.	2.3266795669403253
Arthroscopy as a diagnostic intervention in trauma with haemarthrosis or in any kind of knee effusion is progressively being replaced by sophisticated ultrasound techniques or MRI.	1.9294564814076451
This trend shows a predominant therapeutic use of knee arthroscopy.	2.2127737658862365
Taking our own "incorrect" clinical diagnoses as a starting point we look at common problems in the accurate clinical examination of the symptomatic knee in younger children.	2.0217992904619013
Rational utilization of all kinds of modern diagnostic measures will reduce purely diagnostic arthroscopies in favour of therapeutic endoscopic interventions thus reducing perioperative risks to a minimum.	1.8805871199816744
The pathogenesis of cortical blindness as a rare complication in severe preeclampsia is still unclear.	2.1915862212199535
The case of a women with postpartum blindness is reported in which CT and MRI initially showed cortical and subcortical edema in the parieto-occipital lobes.	2.041825683982912
At this time cerebral angiography and transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) revealed widespread cerebral vasospasm.	1.8727491126967963
Mean blood flow velocities in the middle and posterior cerebral artery and carotid syphon initially reached 380 cm/s and normalized within 2 weeks.	1.926121503795751
While the patient's vision improved rapidly, follow-up MRI disclosed ischemic lesions and petechial hemorrhage in the occipital cortex.	2.1560975572910284
This case provides rare documentation that transient blindness in patients with preeclampsia may result from parieto-occipital ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm.	2.234369280004297
The principle of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for rheumatoid arthritis consists in specifically concentrating a drug (photosensitizer) in the synovium.	2.0548048961946934
Subsequent activation of the photosensitizer by means of a laser leads to a cytotoxic effect.	2.8777137059441356
The practicability of PDT was tested in an animal model of IgG-induced arthritis in rabbits.	2.203246699298385
Photosan-3, 5-aminolevulinic acid and BPD-MA were administered intraarticularly or intravenously.	2.2643404435206724
In this model, concentration of the photosensitizer in the synovial lining cells, the lymphoid infiltrate, and the skin was seen.	2.487763609809309
After laser irradiation a selective demarcation and destruction of the synovium by prior administration of Photosan-3, not constant by BPD-MA and without therapeutic effect by 5-aminolevulinic acid, was observed.	1.898135983322514
In contrast, bradytrophic tissues such as cartilage, meniscus, and ligament structures were changed neither macroscopically nor microscopically in all series.	1.7773241107125575
PDT thus offers ideal preconditions for minimal invasive treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases because of its selectivity and efficacy.	2.284118492166949
The purpose of the study was to identify associations between drug prescriptions and the risk of falls in community-dwelling frail elderly people.	2.2784819869593287
Enlargement of the prostate is an age-related, physiological process that is unique in human tissue.	2.3708783013892014
The prostate gland is the most common site of neoplastic disorders in men.	2.6521557437823
Despite the growing impact of the various prostate diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality, the pathogenesis of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer remains poorly understood.	2.4158003221358277
This reflects the complex composition of the gland with different anatomic, cellular and functional compartments that are differentially involved in benign and malignant disease processes.	1.909086078066559
The present review summarizes new concepts on the morphogenesis of normal and abnormal growth in the human prostate.	2.105812842158233
There is increasing evidence that prostatic stem cells are located in the basal cell layer that is basically involved in normal growth and the development of glandular hyperplasia and prostate cancer.	2.2295329298775215
Severe differentiation and proliferation abnormalities occur during malignant transformation of the prostatic epithelium.	2.1601510281931025
These premalignant changes are associated with abnormal expression of growth factor receptors, oncogene and suppressor gene products and genetic instability.	2.039003806697343
Common prostate cancer is mainly composed of exocrine cell types that remain androgen-responsive even in hormone-independent disease.	1.876964257405117
The frequent occurrence of neuroendocrine differentiation in common prostate cancer reflects the differentiation potency of its stem cells.	1.9603518001078488
The endocrine phenotype derives from exocrine tumor cells via intermediate (amphicrine) cell types.	1.8883034138892387
Neuroendocrine tumor cells consistently lack the nuclear androgen receptor and represent an androgen-insensitive cell population in prostate cancer.	1.9798559406900076
Questionnaires were mailed anonymously to 150 German shock wave centers.	2.0457682934757995
Twenty questions addressed the following areas of interest: - Facilities of the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) center (technical, personnel, laboratory, etc.)	1.8850452165017395
- Cooperation at ESWL center with referring urologists - Laboratory facilities versus actual metabolic work-up.	1.9543904121070241
The return rate was 114 of 150 (76 %).	2.161298468957235
Surprisingly, at 58 % of the centers the average number of treatments is less than two per day.	2.0946160265097777
In 30 % of the centers only chemical stone analysis is done!	2.2950042813014315
The final conclusion was that ESWL has largely replaced the causal metabolic work-up and subsequent metaphylaxis as a symptomatic measure against urolithiasis.	1.936539490245206
Based on current insurance data patients with pseudophakia can be expected to suffer reduced stereoacuity.	2.0941871980439757
A prospective study was carried out to test this relationship.	2.8003927447435597
In 1970 Aulhorn and Harms made fundamental recommendations for the night driving ability of motorists as well as for the corresponding examination methods.	2.17730116103756
Reduced night driving ability of persons over the age of 60, as well the established limits for twilight vision and glare sensitivity, and their relevance to night-time collisions has been re-examined.	2.1464960714601373
Hernias of the obturator foramen are rare.	2.4193701110032024
They are described mostly in elderly female patients in poor health.	2.1697173103673277
Herniation of the entire urinary bladder with hemorrhagic infarction has never been described before.	2.259090779636273
For an anatomical reduction of the hernia it was neccesary to resect the superior pubic ramus.	2.150074793864792
For plastic reconstruction a marlex mesh was used.	2.228681287715654
ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft has become a standard procedure.	2.53898385628275
The graft can be inserted either using two tunnels and a lateral femoral incision or with a femoral half tunnel drilled from the joint, thus avoiding the lateral incision.	2.0210945985132147
Advantages of the single-incision technique in the early rehabilitation period have been claimed.	2.3773123135478955
Preoperative data did not show any significant difference between the two groups.	2.3584515826136605
At follow-up no differences were observed with respect to complications or the progress of rehabilitation.	2.883300104786009
Evaluation after 1 and 4 years according to the IKDC form revealed good to excellent results in 70 % of all patients.	2.473932254822116
The Tegner-score increased significantly, however most patients did not regain their former activity level.	1.942177699666349
ACL-reconstruction reduced anterior translation of the knee significantly at 6 months follow-up.	2.3860085288292847
However, we observed a slight increase of anterior translation after 1 and 4 years in both groups; stability was comparable in both groups at all time periods.	2.329101625782581
We conclude that an arthroscopic singleincision technique has no advantage compared to a mini-open two-incision technique for ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft in terms of subjective or objective parameters.	2.0207095070771186
For determining the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Germany, the outcomes of several epidemiological studies are available.	2.5909546643761385
If these rates are transferred to Germany as a whole, figures result of 67,000 to 138,000 MS patients in all.	1.91492001694215
The differing prevalence rates may be caused by various problems in finding patients, the epidemiological area, and different population structures.	2.289887668925304
To avoid these difficulties, a new approach for calculating the number of patients with diagnosed MS was chosen based on representative samples taken from the groups of physicians involved in MS treatment.	2.289266771715213
The disadvantage of this approach is that it does not allow any questioning of the diagnosis.	2.5746710792850442
Projecting the results in this way and their subsequent compilation - taking "double treatments" into consideration - showed a total of 122,000 patients with diagnosed multiple sclerosis in Germany.	2.2044729734554616
This figure corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is within the range found by Poser et al.	1.8799898933833816
[19]: 127 per 100,000 excluding the diagnostic category "possible multiple sclerosis" and 170 per 100,000 including it.	2.048420228421314
The chemical synthesis of alkyl glucuronides, which appear as metabolites in urine after the consumption of beverages containing congeners of ethanol, is described.	1.8888149801247793
Glucuronides of the following alcohols were synthesized: methanol, d5-ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, R-(-)-2-butanol, S-(+)-2-butanol, isopentanol and S-(-)-2-methylbutanol.	1.942219006198928
The retention indices of acetyl, pentafluorpropyl (PFP) and trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives are given and discussed in relation to the chemical structures.	1.8983271970952391
Mass spectra of homologous derivatives were shown to be very similar but some fragments were specific for the chain length of the alkyl moiety and can be used for identification and a quantitative estimation of glucuronides in urine samples.	2.15793810231139
Decreasing numbers of tuberculosis cases in the western countries have led to diminished attention towards this disease.	2.284230280239606
But worldwide, tuberculosis still is the leading cause of mortality due to any one single infectious agent.	2.109982975813414
In the industrialized countries, immigration, growth of low-income groups and increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients, mainly due to the HIV epidemic, supply a reservoir for tuberculosis.	2.173747589779195
Five efficient STR systems were investigated by automated laser fluorescence analysis on an A.L.F.	1.9932368322759983
DNA samples could be analysed with a high sensitivity (100 pg) and the results were reproducible.	2.860608180249004
No allele drop-out was observed.	2.345388405527471
Using specific allelic ladders, the inter and intra gel deviation was less than 0.5 bp.	2.003437508378201
The allele frequencies, the mean exclusion chance values and the discrimination power  for all five systems are shown.	2.0939011247640473
The combination of the five systems resulted in a power of discrimination of 99.9999989%.	2.2752038717347873
Few technological developments have impacted health sciences over the last years like the internet.	2.3878885835200943
This comes at a time when electronic acquisition, storage and processing of medical data becomes commonplace in the so-called developed countries.	2.044721684029809
The co-operation of different health providers can be facilitated using technological standards initially established for other purposes.	1.9602079694208863
This article is directed towards the gynecologist interested in practical use of the internet and its technologies and critically reviews the value of sample sites on the net.	2.0555607642591904
The accompanying internet website lists relevant resources.	2.2258699806004527
A calculation model was developed for the cost of stone therapy and metaphylaxis in Germany based on estimates of stone incidence, types and recurrence rates, actual costs for stone removal and metaphylaxis (based on data from a district of the social health care system).	1.968167022494708
There are 200,000 stone recurrences per year in Germany.	2.1803483426981933
Cost for treatment of these stones amount to $687,000,000.	2.5058308158191314
Stone metaphylaxis reduces the recurrence rate by some 40 %.	2.4158844625199336
The annual cost for stone removal could be lowered by $275,300,000.	1.9938353778188143
Metabolic evaluation/metaphylaxis amount to $70,100,000 per year, resulting in an net saving of $205,200,000.	2.1605338527685163
In 1997, there were 96 days off-work per stone patient resulting in 5,800,000 days off-work in Germany per year.	1.9517852932288289
Metaphylaxis in stone formers can lower health care cost significantly.	2.1061798196276023
Although health care conditions may vary from country to country, in principle this calculation model is applicable also to other countries.	1.909589448091293
Consideration of estrogen replacement therapy is well established in the treatment of postmenopausal syndrome and osteoporosis in menopause.	2.718383672175137
Some observational epidemiologic studies on this topic have suggested beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease.	2.1260357620404484
A prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trial with respect to cardiovascular events and mortality in postmenopausal hormone users, the HERS (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement) study has recently been published.	2.0856385274218914
Antiischemic effects of estrogens are mediated by improvement of menopausal-associated endothelial dysfunction, calcium antagonism, and activation of endothelial synthesis of prostacyclin.	1.9047603606902594
Improvement in functional state and reduction of stress-induced myocardial ischemia with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been demonstrated in several clinical trials.	2.228080583710204
Inflammatory stimuli induce the expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells.	2.238170762399847
The adhesive forces between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium are antagonized by the shear stress of the flowing blood.	1.981143420762654
Radiologic means aid in assessment of the most suitable side for operation and allow the surgeon to be prepared for special situations in order to perform the operation without difficulties [22].	2.653684423058196
The most suitable modalities are CT and MRI preoperatively.	2.4407574824838103
In uncomplicated cases, conventional imaging suffices for the postoperative needs.	2.2682667573534205
CT should only be performed if the patient complains of symptoms.	2.479808270559732
Systemic immunotherapy, notably with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN), has yielded a response rate of 10 % to 30 % in metastic renal cell carcinoma.	2.2059899896772124
However, systemic immunotherapy is limited by severe side effects, and long-lasting response is rare.	2.6661119655859
Tumor palliation and quality-of-life are important end points for evaluating the clinical benefits of immunotherapy.	2.156158812887709
Experimental and clinical treatment models have proved that local IL-2 application is less toxic than systemic treatment and is therapeutically effective.	2.077002635135636
Here we report long-term experience with inhalation IL-2 therapy in 188 patients who had progressive pulmonary metastatic renal cell carcinoma.	2.399579100760634
High-dose inhalation of IL-2 was used with low-dose systemic IL-2 or IFN.	2.5486822294454834
Maximal toxicity over the total treatment time was mild, and the low incidence of WHO grade 3 toxicity (24 %) allowed social activities and peformance of social roles.	2.152845061110262
Comedication for systemic side effects was required only in half of the patients.	2.4273597389573363
Inhaled IL-2 prevented progress of pulmonary metastases in 68 % of patients for a median period of 9.8 months.	2.296446143293383
Median survival was 12.4 months compared with the expected 5.3 months and quality-of-life did not differ substantially from pretreatment status.	2.2255672675034464
Local treatment can be applied alone or in combination with systemic therapy and can increase therapeutic efficacy.	2.5941463949031953
It is now well known that chronic alcohol abuse is an important factor for developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).	2.531258289993627
While hospitalized, these patients are at great risk for developing an unexpected alcohol-withdrawal syndrome.	2.1679968045279963
Compared to common markers of alcohol abuse, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) has been found to be more sensitive and specific.	2.1563817918913393
It is therefore very useful for detecting alcoholism and controlling compliance of alcohol withdrawal.	2.0697393495393803
We analyzed the serum concentrations of CDT, liver enzymes and mean corpuscular volume in 49 male patients with HNSCC.	1.9895126823901055
Elevated CDT levels were found in more than 25% of patients who earlier denied a history of chronic alcohol abuse.	2.7542035839501215
Over one-third of these patients developed an alcohol-withdrawal syndrome.	2.620266268329201
These findings demonstrated that analysis of elevated CDT serum levels was a valuable method for detecting chronic alcohol abuse and recognizing patients at risk for developing an alcohol-withdrawal syndrome postoperatively.	1.9222432357069672
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an essential role in specific cell deletion during normal embryonal and adult development.	1.970518388909349
Apoptotic cells are characterized by fragmentation of nuclear DNA and formation of apoptotic bodies.	2.1925660838369527
Molecular genetic analysis has revealed the involvement of several deaths and survival genes that are regulated by extracellular and intracellular factors.	1.972621859873552
There are multiple inducers and inhibitors which interact with target cellspecific receptors and transduce signals involved in cellular proliferation, cell cycle progression and programmed cell death.	1.7646751870893826
The elimination of tumor cell populations by applying lethal doses of chemotherapeutic agents or radiation is a well-established strategy in cancer therapy.	2.016126693684939
Although improved cytotoxic chemo- and radiotherapy regimens are available, the efficacy of these strategies is still disappointing with regard to many solid tumors.	2.285374174856309
Better understanding of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis, including death genes, death signals, receptors and signal transduction pathways, will provide new approaches in the development of strategies to regulate malignant cell survival and death.	2.1235554584996494
Recent discoveries in the field of apoptotic cell death promise to have a significant impact on antitumor therapies.	2.402736785974312
Apoptosis is known to be an active process which can be artificially manipulated by several molecular pathways.	2.5811487886552573
This information concerning the regulation and induction of programmed cell death might lead among otherthings, to the development of new powerful means to eliminate malignant cell populations of otherwise resistant genitourinary tumors such as prostate cancer.	2.0657270999873663
We report on a 63-year-old female patient with Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS).	2.026832207181708
In the course of this disease two carcinomas of the colon, a kerato-acanthoma and multiple sebaceous gland tumours, including four sebaceous gland tumours, including four sebaceous carcinomas, appeared.	2.121737460858392
This case is thought to be a heriditary form as one of daughters was also found to have a sebaceous epithelioma.	2.6384831875587316
MTS is a mostly autosomal-dominant disease with the association of sebaceous gland tumours and internal carcinomas.	2.3232149232613675
As the malignant tumours only show slight aggressiveness the prognosis is quite favourable.	2.15584894259939
Oral isotretinoin therapy was successfully used for the inhibition of sebaceous gland proliferation.	2.5894714491818123
A narrower definition is presented and an updated survey of the published cases is given.	2.2770572596192715
Furthermore, the histopathologic peculiarities of sebaceous gland tumours, especially of sebaceous gland carcinomas, are discussed and compared to sebaceous gland tumours not connected with MTS.	2.2278407930966755
The data on internal carcinomas were taken from the work of Cohen et al.	2.1809108465111486
(1991) and 11 current cases were added.	2.461337859182403
The rapid development of modern endovascular, microsurgical, and radiation therapies has considerably expanded the treatment options for encephalic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).	1.8624461392202183
Surgery has the longest history.	2.579295265971862
Single or staged intravascular procedures (embolizations) using fast-acting glues, sclerotic agents, and thrombogenic coils serve to reduce the size of AVM to that suitable for extirpation and may reduce the risk of surgery.	2.039332823372499
Radiation ("gamma-knife") therapy, most frequently used in small, non-operable AVMs, is also viewed by some authors as an alternative or even superior tool in small, operable malformations.	2.129431735263351
Partial embolization to reduce the mass-effect of space-occupying AVMs, to reverse diaschisis, and to treat AVM-related seizure disorders is being discussed and practiced.	2.0751282759944543
Given the in part competing or even controversial options, the selection of optimal treatment for AVM patients is becoming increasingly difficult.	1.9966546757308594
Current management is impeded by the paucity of information on the exact risks of invasive therapies and by insufficient criteria for identifying patients at risk of spontaneous bleeding during the natural course, including the seriousness of such hemorrhage.	2.0910308593552527
A new "all in one" sensing device was developed for continuous transtracheal intraoperative monitoring and in situ detection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroid surgery.	1.9490137983730296
Patients and methods: The new system is based on a double-balloon endotracheal tube with integrated atraumatic stimulating and tracing electrodes.	2.20960844723971
The recurrent laryngeal nerve is stimulated transtracheally and compound action potentials are recorded from the laryngeal muscles.	1.9964509602409608
Fifty-five patients were introduced into a phase-one clinical trial.	2.3522572966172173
Thirty-five patients with primary thyroid operations, 20 patients with reoperations, 10 of whom had neck dissections.	2.331335683251604
All patients were evaluated laryngoscopically and phoniatrically by an ENT specialist before and after surgery.	2.2564378588850844
Results: Compound muscle action potentials were recorded continuously during the whole operation and responded sensitively to tension and pressure to the nerve.	1.9232431356465578
There were no accidental permanent RLN palsies.	2.1521509795711915
Conclusion: The new system offers five advantages: (1) it is atraumatic; (2) it is easy to use; (3) it can monitor continuously with an audio feedback to the surgeon; (4) it works outside the operation field; and (5) it is highly sensitive, even indicating reversible irritation to the nerve.	2.2199536130423048
The diagnosis of primary malignant bone tumors, which only account for 1% of malignancies in humans, represents quite a challange for the pathologist.	2.0607258977640837
Apart from the often overlapping morphology between different entities, heterogeneity within one and the same tumor has to be kept in mind.	2.0153831904815718
Furthermore, in most cases the diagnosis must be established based on small biopsy specimens and occasionally even on frozen sections.	2.1440332031380196
In this context detailed clinical information including the patient's age and exact localization of the tumor, as depicted by X-ray or MRI, are essential requirements for a correct diagnosis.	2.2191474679881407
In addition, multiple biopsies from different tumor sites may be of help.	2.2224107687712453
For example, 25% of osteogenic sarcomas (OSA) are chondroplastic.	2.012905065219017
Others may contain areas similar to fibrosarcoma (FSA) or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH).	1.8391458528225872
Since 90% of OSA occur in the second decade of life whereas chondrosarcomas, FSA and MFH usually manifest after the age of 40 years, a biopsy solely composed of malignant chondromatous tissue obtained from a tibial lesion of a 10-year-old child should most likely be considered as part of an OSA.	2.0988474094175786
In the differential diagnosis of the so-called small, round cell tumors, which include Ewing sarcoma, malignant lymphoma and small-cell OSA, immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin-embedded material and a molecular biological/genetic work-up of frozen material are most helpful.	2.190545122638063
In this paper the histomorphological characteristics and criteria for differential diagnosis of the most common primary malignant bone tumors are discussed.	2.6508300885558875
The care of the patient after primary treatment is very important for both tumor control and patientsi compliance.	2.649609375354103
The aim of this care concept should be the early detection of local recurrences so as to have better secondary treatment (maybe cure) options.	2.1387721041391696
If expensive diagnostics are needed to get this information, it is reasonable to order them.	2.493970727910827
If there is no benefit for the patient, regarding survival or with respect to quality of life, clinical anamnesis and examination should be preferred.	2.8344877664782393
The effect on pain and heat sensation of monomere non-ionic contrast media with different osmolality was assessed in a randomized double-blind study.	1.9731011236832625
Peripheral angiography was performed in 29 patients who suffered from chronic occlusive vessel disease.	2.632879151705828
The two non-ionic contrast media iomeprol and iopentol were applied intraindividually.	1.9809379836918624
The contrast media with an iodine concentration of 350 mg/ml had an osmolality of 618 or 810 mosm/kg.	1.8829852654478632
The mean flow was 13.9 ml/s.	2.3295533942890216
The two contrast medium injections were separated by an interval of 10 min.	2.240320037851355
No analgesic premedication was given.	2.6338161440586854
The pain and heat intensity was semiquantatively measured using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (no heat/pain) to 100 (intractable heat/pain).	1.9333515999574344
The median after the first injection was calculated as 40 for iomeprol and 70 for iopentol.	2.2333887843791587
The comparison of heat and pain sensations after the second injection showed a less distinct difference with a scale rating of 60 for iomeprol and of 65 for iopentol.	1.836372431280825
The statistical variance was highly significant (p < 0.01) in favor of iomeprol.	2.600255645508702
Shampooing is the most common form of hair treatment.	3.1057665061372215
Shampoos have primarily been products aimed at cleansing the hair and scalp.	2.085014717132067
The diversity of qualities demanded from a good shampoo by today's consumer go far beyond this general function.	1.8242862511412477
A cosmetic benefit is expected, and the shampoo formulation has to be tailored to all the possible variations associated with hair quality (dry, greasy, permed, bleached, dyed), age (baby shampoo), care habit (frequency of shampooing) and specific problems relating to the superficial condition of the scalp (dandruff, seborrhea).	1.8637764821393263
Selected ingredients of shampoos that have been popular with the consumer are currently under attack because of potential risks associated with their use (e. g. halogenated organic compounds, formaldehyde, musk fragrances, and crude coal tar).	1.8362366066425884
Our standard graduate training programs devote limited attention to  the subject of shampoos, and much of the readily available information concerning shampoos is supplied by the industry.	1.8476684868149924
We should be increasingly aware that our patients look to us to supply independent information on what can be expected from a shampoo to enable them to make more informed choices at the consumer level.	1.8703509269659262
Despite the era of thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction patients carry an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmogenic death within a time period of one to two years following the acute event.	2.240077666804812
Therefore, risk stratification post-MI before patient discharge is furthermore mandatory.	1.971031868231796
Dysphagia is related to the impairment of food passage from the mouth to the stomach.	2.4241648800711295
Globus pharyngis implies the frequent and often painful sensation of a lump in the throat that usually does not interfere with swallowing and may even be relieved by food intake.	1.724160258852114
The diagnosis is based upon a careful history, clinical examination, endoscopy, dynamic imaging (videofluoroscopy, cinematography, videosonography) and electrophysiologic procedures (including pharyngoesophageal manometry, electromyography and pH determinations).	1.8671483234012634
Structural lesions of the cervical spine such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis are rare causes of dysphagia.	2.364721216826069
Dysphagia following anterior cervical fusion as well as globus and dysphonia due to dysfunction of the vertebral joints are more likely.	2.593516942850937
Dyscoordinated swallowing, nasal reflux, dysphonia or general weakness may also occur.	2.1418587512672285
Chronic aspiration with respiratory compromize is the main consequence in a variety of neurological disorders as well as in cases of postsurgical dysphagia.	2.753266980900798
Relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter indicates coordinated muscle movement between the pharynx and esophagus.	2.2258718503123482
Dysfunction of the pharyngoesophageal segment may lead to cricopharyngeal achalasia.	2.4474591930430925
A dyskinetic sphincter commonly represents an extrapharyngeal cause: i.e., disease associated with gastroesophageal reflux.	2.0916746604516967
Disorders of the esophageal phase of deglutition can produce retrosternal pain, heartburn, regurgitation and vomiting, as well as laryngeal and respiratory signs.	2.176438832682522
Esophageal motility disorders include lower achalasia, tumors, peptic strictures, inflammatory diseases, drug-induced ulcers, rings and webs.	1.9170708805348682
Motility disorders present with aperistaltic, spontaneous contractions, diffuse esophagospasm, or a hypermotile esophagus.	2.000571629675327
Gastroesophageal reflux with esophagitis must always be excluded, especially in patients with a globus sensation.	2.8620160433862387
The multiple features of the appearance of the symptoms of dysphagia and globus makes multidisciplinary approach necessary in order to establish a diagnosis and begin effective treatment.	2.3682453895787523
Different pest arthropods and dermatophytes occurring primarily in farm animals may be transmissible to man and produce human dermatoses.	1.7863311271531934
The movement and cutaneous penetration habits of external parasites often cause crusted papules, severe itching and dermatitis or may damage their hosts by blood-sucking or by sensitizing them to their saliva.	1.696650794889878
Furthermore different dermatophytes should be considered a possible cause of human skin lesions.	2.6572768949685566
Farm animals (cattle, pig, poultry, and rabbit) can transmit external parasites (ticks: Ixodes ricinus, Argas reflexus; fleas: Ceratophyllus gallinae, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, and mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var.	1.5483902884469707
bovis, Sarcoptes scabiei var.	2.389779654515709
suis, Dermanyssus gallinae, Cheyletiella parasitovorax), and dermatophytes (Trichophyton sp., and Microsporum sp.).	2.089090550651195
People who have close contact to infested farm animals are more often exposed to epizoonotic infections.	1.9597382458356405
Certain professions, such as farmers, and veterinarians, are especially vulnerable.	2.4107455291113986
Between 1992 and 1994 two multicentre studies were performed in order to determine the frequency of sensitization to gold salts.	2.8371235168216353
In the first study (1992-1993), 872 patients were tested with gold sodium thiosulfate (NTS) 0.25% in Vaseline (V), 0.5% V. and with potassium dicyanoaurate (KDC) 0.002% aqueous solution.	1.7422206975046912
44 patients (5.1%) had a positive patch test reaction to gold salts: 40 (4.6%) to NTS 0.5% V., 20 (2.3%) to NTS 0.25% V. and 5 (0.6%) to KDC.	1.937601741006377
A higher number of positive patch tests to gold salts was noted in patients also sensitized to another metal salt (8.5%) as compared to those who showed no other sensitivities (3.6%).	2.0927755527255334
Immunologial complications frequently occur during the clinical course in patients with multiple injuries.	3.12799338860522
The increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators during the immunological response to trauma may lead to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and furthermore, to multisystem organ failure (MOF), which is associated with a mortality of up to 80%.	2.372650402562539
The development of multiple organ failure following major trauma is associated with remote organ failure, the dysfunction of organs which were not initially affected by the traum.	2.1292746232635342
This manuscript reviews recent data in experimental trauma research and offers a more detailed evaluation of the immunological findings in trauma patients.	2.1642557077586972
In particular, the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the development or SIRS, MOF and ROF is discussed.	2.3048073578220007
Despite the enormous progress in clinical immunology and the available data on trauma-induced immune dysfunction, a large number of questions still remain to be answered before the immunological alterations following severe trauma can be beneficially influenced by immunomodulatory therapeutic efforts.	1.8927484465923619
A report on two cases with benign tumors of the atrioventricular node (so-called mesothelioma of the av-node or endodermal inclusions of the heart).	2.394664444289904
In one of the cases the tumor could be the cause of the known electrophysiological disturbance of the conduction system (av-block) and of the sudden and unexpected death.	2.6495710114262656
A case of delayed death after a low-voltage accident is presented.	2.128779559133297
At first, an obvious source of electricity was not found.	2.229349110292234
However, electric marks were found on the fingers.	2.225394538338978
The identification of the conductor was performed by analysis of the metallisation of the electric marks.	2.5078830372579377
The location of the probable conductors in a boiler under the hand basin and the discovery in a standing position prior to collapse in a bathtub indicates that the capability to act was preserved for a short time period.	1.782029574969739
In such rare cases death seems to be a result of cardiac arrhythmia resulting in ventricular fibrillation.	2.617112877229568
A 53-year-old man presented a melanotic lung tumor which was based in the bronchus of the left lower lobe and closed the left main bronchus.	2.2229898074741414
After laser therapy, left lobectomy with sleeve resection was carried out.	2.199117454383496
Complications after the surgery required resection of the rest of the left lung and thoracoplasty.	2.6895181436245115
Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma.	2.2870737376053323
There was no past history of an excision or a fulguration of a cutaneous, mucous membrane, or ocular lesion.	1.9078584167815609
Examination of the skin and the eyes did not yield any evidence of another primary tumor.	2.291006837439519
We conclude that the lesion represents a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, a rare neoplasm of which only 21 cases have been confirmed.	2.290722844375907
The patient does not have any evidence of tumor in the relatively short follow-up period of 10 months.	2.546241324853213
Background: To find out the incidence of spontaneous pubertal development in girls with Turner syndrome we investigated patients with a bone age of at least eleven years.	2.4063081156466772
Results: 6 out of 17 patients showed spontaneous puberty.	2.4388656697502706
There exists no clear correlation between karyotype and phenotype on the one hand and incidence of spontaneous puberty on the other.	2.189467617204688
Basal as well as stimulated gonadotropin levels in the late childhood could better indicate spontaneous puberty in Turner syndrome.	2.322897557156996
Conclusion: In contrast to the generally held opinion spontaneous pubertal development is not rare in girls with Turner syndrome.	2.102833009176512
All patients had undergone previous operations, some several times.	2.186909830791126
The recurrence rate of 13 % appeared to be low after a short follow-up.	2.408663562522828
Continence was only negligibly impaired, although the anal resting pressure and contraction pressure were significantly reduced.	2.0748103280698627
In five patients a shortened prewarning period was noticed.	2.2038049027276125
Also in Crohn's fistulae the results were equivalent when the surgical treatment was performed in a non-inflammatory period.	2.624106184225375
Staging of malignant tumours of the oral cavity and the oropharynx not only requires far more than a basic knowledge of anatomy and the usual pathways of spread, but also a broad understanding of the diagnostic benefits of current imaging modalities.	2.2221610659192237
As radiology should never try to replace histology, the main aim should be precise prediction of tumour margins and differention of tumour from edema and posttherapeutic changes.	1.8817877580671312
Only then will imaging studies have a significant clinical impact.	2.3408228298185474
Post-traumatic recurrent dislocation is a major problem in the operative treatment of shoulder dysfunction in young athletes.	2.4078796413651022
This prospectively designed study evaluates the long-term results of a modified Eden-Hybinette procedure in young male athletes.	2.284302512237057
The criteria were: capacity in sports, functional limit, and persistent pain.	2.1070512082044157
Genuine disorders of the glenoid or muscular imbalance of the shoulder joint were criteria for exclusion.	2.4433273360692915
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disorder which primarily affected the myocardium.	2.297140596194855
It is characterized by a hypertrophic left ventricle that shows normal systolic function but impaired diastolic relaxation.	1.963550726015099
The most important complication of HCM, sudden cardiac death, is mainly responsible for a mortality of approximately 3.5% in childhood.	2.0795222103626037
While most patients remain asymptomatic for years, there are some reports about patients progressing from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to a dilative form within years.	2.0845811065524518
A prospective study was performed on 72 patients with osteochondritis dissecans (OD) of the knee and ankle to compare plane radiography, MRI and arthroscopy before therapeutic procedures.	2.2181181290467333
Special interest was placed on the assessment of fragment stability with radiological methods for staging related therapy.	2.2047473178253227
OD was localized in 46 cases on the femoral condyle and in 26 cases on the talus.	2.332461149590006
Radiological methods were performed simultaneously and shortly before definite arthroscopical therapy.	2.135704854562076
Using conventional radiography, OD of the condyles was staged according to the classification of Rodegerdts and Gleissner and OD of the talus suggested by Berndt and Harty.	2.1355595810791903
MRI staging was performed by morphology of the interface of the OD.	2.561385257717751
Arthroscopical staging based on the classification of Guhl.	3.1954764256090735
There was an excellent correlation between the stages in MRI and arthroscopy, showing correct prediction of stable and unstable fragments in 92%.	2.0175769214616537
In contrast, fragment stability could not be efficiently assessed by conventional radiology because fragments could be stably fixed in cases of bony separation.	2.153568000305827
MRI is indicated before performance of staging-related therapy of OD to select patients with stable fragments for conservative therapy and those with unstable OD for surgical therapy.	1.9668676389241635
A case of rupture of the right hemidiaphragm resulting from blunt trauma with complete intrathoracic dislocation of the right hepatic lobe in a multiple trauma patient is presented.	2.472929968735842
After a primary chest X-ray study had been interpreted as showing right-sided hemothorax, the thoracic drainage tube was accidentally placed into the liver.	2.0744656010841966
CT revealed a diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture with intrathoracic liver dislocation.	2.2749563215532986
The liver was replaced and the extended dorsal diaphragmatic rupture was closed primarily via an abdominal approach.	1.9947820445979432
Problems of diagnosis and operative procedure in rare cases of fresh right-sided blunt traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures are discussed.	2.3021356693480466
